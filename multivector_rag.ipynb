Not how I, Andrew can get more motivated, although of course I asked myself that question from time to time.\\nAlthough admittedly, most of the time I'm wondering how I'm just going to get everything that I need to get done, done.\\nBut I often get the question, how can I feel more motivated? Or what can I do to sustain my motivation over time? And we hear a lot of different strategies about how to do that.\\nWe hear about the quote unquote, just do it strategy, the incredible slogan that Nike created and that persists to this day has become commonplace in culture.\\nAnd indeed the just do it form of advice can be a good one, but for a lot of people, just hearing just do it or telling themselves just do it is not something that can evoke action in them.\\nOther people will listen to motivational speeches, they'll look at motivational videos, they'll read motivational books, they may even hire coaches.\\nIn other words, people invest a ton of time, energy and money into trying to be more motivated.\\nAnd indeed a number of episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast have focused on the relationship between say motivation drive and the neuromodulator dopamine.\\nWe have several episodes about that as well as a toolkit, all of which are available at zero cost at hubermanlab.com.\\nYou can access those easily by putting motivation into the search function at hubermanlab.com.\\nAll of that will come up timestamped, et cetera.\\nBut perhaps surprisingly today's conversation about music offers us a particularly potent tool to increase motivation.\\nAnd that's because one of the fundamental properties of listening to music is that it evokes activation of these pre-motor and motor circuits within our brain and body.\"),\n",
       "   Document(page_content=\"And I'm sort of joking when I say not 10, not eight, but nine because of course you could listen to music for 10 minutes or 15 minutes or longer.\\nIn fact, earlier we talked about the benefits of doing that.\\nBut when one examines the various studies that looked at how long subjects need to listen to music in order to shift their mood into a happier state, the threshold seems to be nine minutes.\\nSo if you want to feel happier than you currently feel, it seems that listening to happy music for nine minutes or more is going to be the effective approach.\\nOkay, so nine minutes or more to shift one state to happier.\\nWhat about to process somber or sad feelings, feelings of loss? Well, this raises an even bigger question and it's a question that I also get very often.\\nAs you're noticing, I get a lot of questions often.\\nIn any event, one of the common questions that I get is when we are feeling sad or experiencing a loss, grieving the loss of a relationship by death or decision or by somebody moving away or the loss of a pet, et cetera, is it better to go into that state? In other words, to quote unquote, feel one's feelings or to counter those feelings.\\nNow, historically that's been a very difficult question for me to answer because who am I to say whether or not you should feel your feelings or whether or not feeling those feelings will take you down a trench of feeling much worse or much better.\\nIn fact, there's an emerging literature exactly about that issue.\\nThat is whether or not the catharsis model is really best catharsis being the expression and feeling of one's emotions as a way to extrude or get rid of those emotions or whether or not that simply drives us further down the trench of those emotions.\\nThat's really something that we should address in a separate podcast episode.\\nAnd I will have experts from the fields of psychiatry and psychology to help us address that question directly.\"),\n",

       "[[Document(page_content=\"Because as I alluded to earlier, what caffeine is doing for us is not just making us more alert, improving our memory, improving our reaction time and so on.\\nIt's actually acting as a powerful reinforcer of experience.\\nAnd it's acting as not just a powerful reinforcer of the caffeine containing drink that we drink, but also the mug that it's contained in, plus the person that we might be sitting across from when we consume that caffeine and so on.\\nIf it's a little bit hard for you to conceptualize what a reinforcer is and why I'm calling it a reinforcer, let me spell it out in three specific ways.\\nWe often hear about the word reward.\\nAnd we think, okay, if we do certain things and we like the outcome, then those certain things are rewarded, right? If we're doing something, we receive praise, the praise is the reward.\\nAnd therefore we are more likely to do that thing in the future.\\nIn fact, a lot of parenting is like that.\\nAnd a lot of life is like that.\\nHowever, when we hear the word reward, we often think about something that feels good to us.\\nAnd certainly if we've worked hard and we get some praise, that's natural for the praise to feel good to us.\\nOr for instance, if we work very hard and we get a certain outcome, a trophy, a financial outcome, a degree outcome, recognition, et cetera, all of those can act as rewards, but those are all conscious rewards.\\nWe are aware that they are happening.\\nReinforcers are a little bit different because the word reinforcement can apply to conscious rewards of the sort that I just described.\\nBut there are also many ways in which caffeine stimulates the release of chemicals in our body that act as reinforcers.\\nBut those reinforcers are subconscious.\\nThat is, we are not aware that they cause this preference for the activities that cause their release.\"),\n",
       "  Document(page_content=\"Now, I'm also talking about caffeine as a strong reinforcer in that it makes you feel good overall, and it does, and that suggests that it also taps into the more classic reward pathway, but it does that in a very interesting and frankly almost diabolical way.\\nWhen we regularly ingest caffeine, it stimulates the increase in dopamine receptors at multiple sites throughout the brain, but in particular within the reward pathways of the brain.\\nSo not the areas of the brain that are associated with focus and clarity of thought and cognition.\\nIt does that, but it is also increasing the level of dopamine receptors in the reward pathway.\\nAnd what that means is that for any dopamine that's released in response to a positive experience, social experience, or any number of the other things that can stimulate dopamine release, there are more receptors, more parking spots, if you will, for that dopamine to arrive at and to exert its increases in mood, increases in motivation, and overall feelings of drive and excitement.\\nSo there are four ways that caffeine works that we need to understand.\\nFirst of all, caffeine acts as a reinforcing agent.\\nIt increases the probability that you will return to and engage in a certain activity or consume a certain beverage or food.\\nSecond of all, caffeine increases dopamine and acetylcholine, which are both neuromodulators in the forebrain, which helps us improve our ability to think, to modify our rule sets, that is to adjust our strategies for different social situations and mental demands and physical demands.\\nAnd third, it increases the number and efficacy of dopamine receptors in the reward pathways of the brain.\\nThat is, it makes things that would feel pretty good, feel even better.\\nAnd fourth, caffeine acts as an antagonist to adenosine, which offsets the sleepiness that we would otherwise feel from the accumulation of adenosine that occurs as we are awake for more and more hours throughout the day.\"),\n",
       "  Document(page_content=\"Now, that said, there are certain situations in which you want to avoid caffeine, and there are certain people who might opt to avoid caffeine.\\nThat's especially the case when one thinks about caffeine not just as a stimulant, but as a reinforcer.\\nIn fact, caffeine is such a strong reinforcer that if even tiny amounts of caffeine are present in certain foods and drinks, you will very quickly come to prefer those foods and drinks over other choices, which can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on what sorts of food and drink choices you're trying to make.\\nSo today, I'm going to inform you about how caffeine works at a mechanistic level.\\nI promise to do that with a minimum of nomenclature and such that even if you don't have a background in biology, you will be able to digest that information easily.\\nAnd then I'll tell you how to use caffeine to your advantage, or conversely, how to avoid caffeine at certain times to your advantage.\\nSo today's episode will focus both on mechanisms and tools that is the use and leverage of caffeine to improve mental health, physical health, and performance.\\nBefore we go any further into today's discussion, I want to tell you about some recent results about a molecule that's found in certain caffeinated beverages and that has been proven to be very useful for both weight loss, mental performance, and controlling blood sugar levels.\\nAnd that's GLP-1 or glucagon-like peptide-1.\\nGlucagon-like peptide-1 is found in the brain and body.\\nIt acts both on the brain and body.\\nIt does many different things, but one of its primary effects that's been discovered is to reduce hunger, and it does that two ways.\\nIt does that by activating certain neurons in your hypothalamus, so that's a brain region that controls hunger and satiety.\\nIt makes us feel full at the level of the brain, so it makes us feel sated, that is, and it actually makes us feel full.\"),\n",
       "  Document(page_content=\"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.\\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.\\nToday, we are discussing caffeine.\\nCaffeine is one of the most widely used substances on the planet.\\nEstimates are that more than 90% of adults and as many as 50% of kids, that is adolescents and teenagers, use caffeine on a daily basis.\\nCaffeine is an amazing molecule.\\nMost people are familiar with caffeine's ability to increase alertness and to reduce our feelings of sleepiness and fatigue.\\nAnd indeed, it does that.\\nBut what most people are not aware of is that caffeine acts as a strong reinforcer.\\nWhat I mean by reinforcer is that when caffeine is present in a drink or food, and yes, indeed, caffeine is present in many foods, even unbeknownst to us, when it's present in drinks and foods, we actively come to like those foods and drinks more than if caffeine were not contained in those foods and drinks.\\nSo it reinforces our liking of particular foods and drinks, and indeed, it even reinforces our liking of the containers they are consumed from and the company we keep when we consume foods and drinks that contain caffeine.\\nThat is, caffeine is not just a stimulant, caffeine is a reinforcer, and it's a reinforcer that plays an active role in almost everybody's daily life.\\nWe can say that with confidence because, as I mentioned a moment ago, more than 90% of people are consuming caffeine, and most people think that they consume caffeine because it makes them feel more alert.\\nBut there are many reasons why you're consuming caffeine, and I'm not going to tell you that consuming caffeine isn't necessarily bad.\\nIn fact, today, I'm going to tell you about many of the positive health benefits of caffeine, including neuroprotective effects, anti-depressive effects, and certainly performance-enhancing effects, both for mental performance and for physical performance.\"),\n",
       "  Document(page_content=\"For instance, I wonder why we are not pairing caffeine with broccoli and that here I'm not suggesting that people actually do that experiment or play that trick on people, but you have to sort of imagine that if caffeine is this incredible reinforcer of all sorts of things, in particular, things that we ingest and would want to ingest more of if it's paired with caffeine, well, then you actually can use caffeine as a tool to increase reinforcement of different things and you can avoid caffeine as a way to further reinforce things that you would like to stop.\\nAnd here I'd like to just give the example of sugar cravings.\\nA lot of people ask me, how do I avoid sugar cravings? I've talked about the use of L-glutamine for that.\\nI've talked about making sure you're getting enough essential fatty acids and essential amino acids as a way to reduce sugar cravings.\\nPlease note, however, that if you are somebody who likes to have your sugar, whether or not it's a piece of chocolate or your dessert, et cetera, I'm not saying that's bad, but if you're trying to reduce your sugar cravings, ask yourself, are you ingesting sugar along with caffeine? Could be the caffeine contained in that sugar containing food like chocolate, or it could be that you're having a cup of coffee along with your pastry and then you're struggling with sugar cravings.\\nWell, think about it.\\nYou're not just being reinforced by the sugar and the effects of sugar on dopamine, which are real and both conscious and subconscious through the gut to the brain dopamine system and direct on the brain dopamine system.\\nBut by co-ingesting caffeine, you are also further enhancing the reinforcing effects of sugar.\\nThe flip side to all of this is that you could use caffeine as a way to increase your appetite for certain things.\"),\n",
       "  Document(page_content=\"So let's talk first about caffeine as a reinforcing agent.\\nAgain, this was first most beautifully demonstrated in this study on honeybees, where the bees prefer nectars that contain caffeine, and that all makes perfect sense in terms of the ecology of bees and flowers that contain nectar.\\nThere's an advantage, at least in terms of adaptation, that the flower benefits because of distribution of things from the flower, which is good for the flowers, and the bees benefit because they're getting food.\\nAnd so there's a kind of a symbiosis there.\\nBut with humans, we're consuming caffeine-containing beverages for our sake.\\nI don't think we have it in mind, nor do the bees have it in mind, frankly, that we're trying to preserve the plants that provide the caffeine.\\nI think we would all suffer, or I should say 90% of adults would suffer greatly if all the caffeine-containing coffee and tea plants were gone, certainly.\\nBut most of us are not consuming coffees and teas and caffeine-containing foods because we're thinking about the plants they come from and we want to help those plants.\\nWe're thinking about how we want to help ourselves.\\nAnd yet the point of the reinforcing effects of caffeine are that they are largely subconscious.\\nWe are not aware of them.\\nNow you might say, no, that's not true.\\nWhen I drink caffeine, it makes me feel really good.\\nSo I'm aware that it makes me feel good.\\nIn order to illustrate how reinforcement really works, let me give you the counter example, which would be an aversive agent.\\nSo we have reinforcing agents and we have aversive agents.\\nLet's say that there were compounds in nature that exist in plants that are aversive.\\nAnd indeed they are.\\nAnd let's say that these compounds were present at such low concentrations that you couldn't taste them.\\nLet's say you wake up in the morning and you go to your refrigerator and you open it up and you are thirsty.\\nAnd so you reach for a nice, you know, rich red-containing beverage in a glass jar.\")]]"
