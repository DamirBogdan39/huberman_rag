Not how I, Andrew can get more motivated, although of course I asked myself that question from time to time.\\nAlthough admittedly, most of the time I'm wondering how I'm just going to get everything that I need to get done, done.\\nBut I often get the question, how can I feel more motivated? Or what can I do to sustain my motivation over time? And we hear a lot of different strategies about how to do that.\\nWe hear about the quote unquote, just do it strategy, the incredible slogan that Nike created and that persists to this day has become commonplace in culture.\\nAnd indeed the just do it form of advice can be a good one, but for a lot of people, just hearing just do it or telling themselves just do it is not something that can evoke action in them.\\nOther people will listen to motivational speeches, they'll look at motivational videos, they'll read motivational books, they may even hire coaches.\\nIn other words, people invest a ton of time, energy and money into trying to be more motivated.\\nAnd indeed a number of episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast have focused on the relationship between say motivation drive and the neuromodulator dopamine.\\nWe have several episodes about that as well as a toolkit, all of which are available at zero cost at hubermanlab.com.\\nYou can access those easily by putting motivation into the search function at hubermanlab.com.\\nAll of that will come up timestamped, et cetera.\\nBut perhaps surprisingly today's conversation about music offers us a particularly potent tool to increase motivation.\\nAnd that's because one of the fundamental properties of listening to music is that it evokes activation of these pre-motor and motor circuits within our brain and body.\"),\n",
       "   Document(page_content=\"And I'm sort of joking when I say not 10, not eight, but nine because of course you could listen to music for 10 minutes or 15 minutes or longer.\\nIn fact, earlier we talked about the benefits of doing that.\\nBut when one examines the various studies that looked at how long subjects need to listen to music in order to shift their mood into a happier state, the threshold seems to be nine minutes.\\nSo if you want to feel happier than you currently feel, it seems that listening to happy music for nine minutes or more is going to be the effective approach.\\nOkay, so nine minutes or more to shift one state to happier.\\nWhat about to process somber or sad feelings, feelings of loss? Well, this raises an even bigger question and it's a question that I also get very often.\\nAs you're noticing, I get a lot of questions often.\\nIn any event, one of the common questions that I get is when we are feeling sad or experiencing a loss, grieving the loss of a relationship by death or decision or by somebody moving away or the loss of a pet, et cetera, is it better to go into that state? In other words, to quote unquote, feel one's feelings or to counter those feelings.\\nNow, historically that's been a very difficult question for me to answer because who am I to say whether or not you should feel your feelings or whether or not feeling those feelings will take you down a trench of feeling much worse or much better.\\nIn fact, there's an emerging literature exactly about that issue.\\nThat is whether or not the catharsis model is really best catharsis being the expression and feeling of one's emotions as a way to extrude or get rid of those emotions or whether or not that simply drives us further down the trench of those emotions.\\nThat's really something that we should address in a separate podcast episode.\\nAnd I will have experts from the fields of psychiatry and psychology to help us address that question directly.\"),\n",

       "   Document(page_content=\"There's a lot of kind of lore, old school lore about how to relieve a hangover.\\nWe already talked about how eating food won't do that, but eating food will prevent the rapid absorption of even more alcohol into the bloodstream.\\nThere's the lore that one should simply ingest more alcohol.\\nWhat terrible advice that is.\\nThat's just going to delay an even worse hangover.\\nHowever, I'd be remiss if I didn't say that the reason that that myth came to be, or that I should say that truth came to be, because indeed ingesting more alcohol will alleviate a hangover, but then a worse hangover will show up.\\nThe reason that came to be is because ingestion more alcohol will cause those constricted vessels that are giving the headache to dilate again.\\nBut of course, ingesting more alcohol to relieve a hangover is simply a bad idea.\\nJust don't do it.\\nI think this is called the hair of the dog approach.\\nMaybe someone can put in the show note captions on YouTube, why it's called the hair of the dog.\\nI can come up with a few ideas, but they're not going to be very good ones.\\nAnd some of them would probably even be outright ridiculous.\\nSo do not ingest more alcohol simply to try and recover from a hangover.\\nI know many people have tried that one before, but that's a terrible idea.\\nNow, one thing that you'll also hear out there is that deliberate cold exposure, for instance, taking a cold shower might relieve hangover.\\nI find this one particularly interesting because we've done episodes on the benefits of deliberate cold exposure.\\nWe have an entire episode about that.\\nYou can find it again, hubermanlab.com.\\nThere are direct links to some of the tools related to deliberate cold exposure.\\nAnd we have an entire newsletter on deliberate cold exposure protocols.\\nYou can find on hubermanlab.com, go to our neural network newsletter.\\nSo those of you that are interested in ice baths and cold showers and ways to leverage those, you can find that there.\"),\n",

One cup of coffee, or two cups of coffee, for instance, to achieve that 100 to 300 milligram range, if that's what's appropriate for your body weight.\\nBut to avoid any confusion, when I talk about dosage of caffeine, what I'm really talking about is not the total amount of caffeine ingested per day.\\nI'm talking about the total amount of caffeine ingested in one sitting, or setting, that is.\\nAnd if you're somebody who's drinking caffeine multiple times throughout the day, you could imagine, for instance, let's say the appropriate dose for you in order to get an enhancement in mental performance or physical performance is 200 milligrams, and you are somebody who's doing some work in the morning, and you want to have that lift in the morning to be able to focus better, and you're doing some physical exercise in the afternoon, or vice versa, that you would ingest 200 milligrams of caffeine at two separate times per day, separated by about four hours.\\nNow, you don't have to separate them.\"),\n",

Well, there are a couple of reasons for doing that.\\nPerhaps you're planning to travel to a new time zone and you want to use caffeine as a stimulant to stay up during the day in the new time zone.\\nThat's a somewhat unusual case.\\nOthers of you might be interested in the pro-physical performance effects of caffeine.\\nWe'll talk more about these in a little bit, but you want to get the maximum strength increase or the maximum endurance increase from ingesting, in this case, 300 to 600 milligrams of caffeine.\\nWell, in that case, abstaining from caffeine for five days will greatly exacerbate the pro-performance effects of caffeine when you take it on that sixth day.\\nAlthough, admittedly, those five days are likely to be pretty painful if you're a regular caffeine user.\\nAnother variation on this, however, might be to have the amount of caffeine that you ingest on a daily basis and then go back to your regular level of caffeine intake on that day in which you need the caffeine to really boost your mood, energy, and performance.\\nAnother reason why you might want to abstain from caffeine or reduce your caffeine intake for a period of time and then go back to your regular caffeine intake is simply to identify how much of an effect caffeine is really having on your overall level of daily functioning and mood.\\nThis was something that was actually covered in beautiful detail in a book by Michael Pollan, All About Caffeine.\\nIt's available on Audible.\\nI really enjoyed that book.\\nIt describes his experience with the decision to completely abstain from caffeine for a period of months.\"),\n",
       "   Document(page_content=\"So this is all just to say that caffeine is an incredible performance enhancing tool.\\nNow, what's not obvious from the statement that caffeine is a performance enhancing tool across the board and in men and women and in different contexts is that the way in which caffeine is taken is very important.\\nBecause 90% or more of adults consume caffeine, finding controls for studies of caffeine is really challenging.\\nThat is finding people who don't ingest caffeine regularly is a very challenging task for the researcher.\\nAnd as a consequence, many of the studies of caffeine on human beings involve depriving regular caffeine users of caffeine and then examining the effects of caffeine given after a period of say five to 15 days of abstinence in a person that is essentially experiencing mild withdrawal symptoms because they haven't had the caffeine that they were used to getting.\\nSo this is an important point.\\nAnd it's a point that likely exacerbates the observed pro-performance effects of caffeine.\\nNow, all of that isn't necessarily a problem provided you keep it in mind.\\nAnd it actually points to a way in which even if you're a regular caffeine user, you can extract more of the benefits of caffeine.\\nThe simplest way to do this, for instance, is to look back to what we talked about earlier in terms of the need to have most of your cortisol increase restricted to the hour or hours just after waking in terms of mood and alertness and performance.\\nOne of the ways to increase the peak of that cortisol early in the day is to consume caffeine shortly after that peak occurs.\\nAnd this was really nicely demonstrated in a study entitled caffeine stimulation of cortisol secretion across the waking hours in relation to caffeine intake levels.\\nWe will provide a link to this study.\\nIt's a somewhat complicated study because they looked at a bunch of different times of day for caffeine intake.\\nAnd I should mention this study, they use this 300 milligrams per day or 600 milligrams per day.\"),\n",
       "   Document(page_content=\"Now, if you happen to be ingesting more than one to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight of caffeine, that's not necessarily bad.\\nHowever, you do want to be careful about ingesting very high levels of caffeine over long periods of time in your life because there can be issues that start to arise in particular, a bias towards higher levels of anxiety and depletion of certain electrolytes because caffeine is a diuretic can cause you to lose sodium and other things of that sort.\\nAnd also just from simply a dependent standpoint, it does appear that if you ingest high levels of caffeine that is exceeding the dosages that normally you could get away with and get just as much mental enhancing and physical enhancing benefits that you can cause some disruption to the microvasculature.\\nYou can bias yourself towards headaches, anxiety attacks and you can become actually quite irritable when you're not getting those higher levels of caffeine.\\nSo I do encourage you to figure out not just what an appropriate caffeine dosage would be for you, but also how much caffeine you might already be ingesting.\\nThe first tool I'd like to talk about is one that I've mentioned before on this podcast several times.\\nAnd it's something that if you haven't heard of will be very useful to you.\\nAnd if you have heard this tool before, I'm going to add some additional features to the description of this tool that should make this worthwhile for you as well.\\nAnd that is to delay your caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes after waking up on most days.\\nAnd I'll be very clear as to days in which you might want to ingest caffeine more closely to when you wake up.\\nWhy would you want to delay your caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes after waking? The answer to that is very simple.\\nMany people wake up in the morning, they drink caffeine within 10, 20, 30, sometimes within two minutes of waking and they feel more alert naturally.\"),\n",
       "   Document(page_content=\"Now, you don't have to separate them.\\nYou could put them two hours apart, for instance, but we'll talk about half-life of caffeine and so forth.\\nJust keep in mind that if you're ingesting 200 milligrams of caffeine, and that's the appropriate dose for you based on your body weight, and then you are ingesting another 200 milligrams of caffeine an hour later, you are effectively ingesting approximately 400 milligrams of caffeine, which is going to start exceeding the dose in which you can normally tolerate without feeling anxious and jittery.\\nWith all of that said, there is a range of tolerance for caffeine that's based on two things.\\nOne is a pre-existing disposition, that is whether or not your genetics and nervous system and the backdrop of your life, how much stress you're experiencing, tends to make you feel more anxious and alert and jittery before you ingest any caffeine.\\nAnd the other is how so-called caffeine adapted you are.\\nWe often hear about tolerance.\\nTolerance means something very specific.\\nIt's the ability to ingest more and more of something with a plateau that is a no increase or an actual reduction in the effectiveness of that thing.\\nBut here, we're not really talking about tolerance to caffeine.\\nWhat we're talking about is being caffeine adapted.\\nA simple way to understand whether or not you're caffeine adapted or not is that if you drink caffeine and it tends to increase your heart rate and make you feel more alert and a bit more anxious, then chances are you are not caffeine adapted, provided the amount of caffeine is within the healthy range for you, that is, the ranges we talked about a moment ago.\\nHowever, if you're somebody who drinks caffeine and you actually feel alert and relaxed, chances are you are caffeine adapted.\\nAnd so at various times during today's episode, I'll talk about people who are caffeine adapted and people who are not caffeine adapted.\\nWe'll talk about the use of caffeine every other day.\")]]}"
