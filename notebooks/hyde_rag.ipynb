Well, let's explore that because as wild as that seems,  it turns out that what we believe about a given drug  treatment or behavioral treatment  actually has a high degree of specificity.\\n So to illustrate the incredible specificity  of placebo effects,  I want to describe a study related to hormone function.\\n Hormones come in many different forms.\\n We have testosterone, estrogen, growth hormone,  cortisol, et cetera.\\n There's a study that was carried out in humans  in which subjects were informed about growth hormone release  and cortisol release.\\n Growth hormone is a hormone released from a gland  in the brain called the pituitary.\\n The pituitary has different parts.\\n The anterior pituitary releases growth hormone.\\n Each night when you go to sleep,  it's involved in protein synthesis, tissue repair,  bodily growth, appendage growth, and many other things.\"}},\n",

They are not unique to the laboratory,  and they are the following.\\n First of all, placebo effects are strongly modifiable  by the expectation of the quality of a given treatment.\\n For instance, if you are given a placebo  that has a brand name on it,  or a name of a drug, it could even be a made-up name,  you don't know what the drug does,  but it has trademark TM there in the corner of the name,  so brand name as opposed to generic placebo,  the brand name placebo has a stronger effect.\\n Moreover, if a placebo is placed into a package,  not just put in front of you on a little tray  or in a little dish, but rather in a package  where you have to push it through that little foil wrapping,  or you have to take it out of a bottle,  and especially if that wrapping or bottle has a label on it,  or it looks as if it's a quote unquote real drug,  well, then the placebo has an even greater placebo effect.\"}},\n",
