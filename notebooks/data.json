    "content": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to\nthe Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science\nand science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of Neurobiology\nand Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today we are\ndiscussing caffeine. Caffeine is one of the\nmost widely used substances on the planet. Estimates are that more than\n90% of adults and as many as 50% of kids that is\nadolescents and teenagers use caffeine on a daily basis. Caffeine is an amazing molecule. Most people are familiar\nwith caffeine's ability to increase alertness and\nto reduce our feelings of sleepiness and fatigue. And indeed, it does that. But what most people\nare not aware of is that caffeine acts\nas a strong reinforcer. What I mean by reinforcer\nis that, when caffeine is present in a drink or food-- and yes, indeed, caffeine\nis present in many foods even unbeknownst to us. When it's present\nin drinks and foods, we actively come to like those\nfoods and drinks more than if caffeine were not contained\nin those foods and drinks. So it reinforces our liking of\nparticular foods and drinks. And indeed, it even\nreinforces our liking of the containers\nthey are consumed from and the company we keep when we\nconsume foods and drinks that contain caffeine. That is, caffeine is\nnot just a stimulant. Caffeine is a reinforcer. And it's a reinforcer that\nplays an active role in almost everybody's daily life. We can say that with confidence\nbecause, as I mentioned a moment ago, more than 90% of\npeople are consuming caffeine. And most people think that they\nconsume caffeine because it makes them feel more alert. But there are many reasons\nwhy you're consuming caffeine. And I'm not going to tell you\nthat consuming caffeine is necessarily bad. In fact, today, I'm going\nto tell you about many of the positive health\nbenefits of caffeine, including\nneuroprotective effects, antidepressive\neffects, and certainly performance-enhancing effects,\nboth for mental performance and for physical performance. Now that said, there are\ncertain situations in which you want to avoid caffeine, and\nthere are certain people who might opt to avoid caffeine. That's especially the case\nwhen one thinks about caffeine not just as a stimulant\nbut as a reinforcer. In fact, caffeine is\nsuch a strong reinforcer that, if even tiny\namounts of caffeine are present in certain\nfoods and drinks, you will very quickly\ncome to prefer those foods and drinks over\nother choices, which can be a good thing\nor a bad thing, depending on what sorts\nof food and drink choices you're trying to make. So today, I'm\ngoing to inform you about how caffeine works\nat a mechanistic level. I promise to do\nthat with a minimum of nomenclature and such\nthat, even if you don't have a background in\nbiology, you will be able to digest that\ninformation easily. And then I'll tell you how to\nuse caffeine to your advantage or conversely how to avoid\ncaffeine at certain times to your advantage. So today's episode will focus\nboth on mechanisms and tools that is the use and\nleverage of caffeine to improve mental\nhealth, physical health, and performance. Before we go any further\ninto today's discussion, I want to tell you about some\nrecent results about a molecule that's found in certain\ncaffeinated beverages and that has been proven to\nbe very useful for both weight loss, mental performance, and\ncontrolling blood sugar levels. And that's GLP-1 or\nglucagon-like peptide 1. Glucagon-like peptide 1 is\nfound in the brain and body. It acts both on\nthe brain and body. It does many different things. But one of its primary\neffects that's been discovered is to reduce hunger. And it does that in two ways. It does that by\nactivating certain neurons in your hypothalamus. So that's a brain region that\ncontrols hunger and satiety. It makes us feel full at\nthe level of the brain, so it makes us feel\nsated, that is. And it actually\nmakes us feel full. It turns out that GLP-1 acts\non certain receptors in the gut to make us feel as if\nwe've ingested enough food. It doesn't necessarily\nmake us feel as if our gut is distended,\nbut it makes us feel full. That's really interesting\nbecause, if you think about it, when we eat,\nour stomach fills up, obviously. And that information has to be\ncommunicated to the brain such that the brain can then send\nsatiety signals that actually shut off our hunger. And believe it or not,\nthe brain actually activates signals\nto reduce the desire to chew when our\nstomach is full. And GLP-1, as I mentioned,\nworks on the brain to create these feelings of\nsatiety as if we've had enough and to reduce our\ndesire to eat more. And GLP-1 acts\ndirectly on the gut to give us a slight sense of\nfullness in the gut, which then is communicated to the brain. So really, there are\ntwo parallel signals being sent when we have\nGLP-1 present in our system. Now a little bit of\nrelevant history on GLP-1. It was actually discovered\nin Gila monsters. These are these reptiles that\ncan go long periods of time without eating. And a very clever\nscientist decided to study why it is that certain\nanimals like Gila monsters can go a long period of time\nwithout ingesting anything. And it's because they produce\nvery large amounts of GLP-1. They isolate the\npeptide from GLP-1, then they looked for the\nanalogous peptide in humans. And it turns out\nthat does exist. And as I mentioned, it's\nreleased in both brain and body to make you feel full and sated. Why am I telling you all this? Well, today we're going\nto talk about caffeine. And there's one particular\ncaffeine source, which is yerba mat\u00e9, and there\nare some other forms of teas similar to yerba mate that\nstimulate the release of GLP-1 significantly. There are also nowadays drugs\nwhich are called analogues of GLP-1. So these are drugs\nthat mimic or are identical to the kind of\nGLP-1 that you would make. And those drugs are proven\nto be very effective for the treatment of\ncertain forms of diabetes and for the\ntreatment of obesity, but they trigger\nenormous amounts of GLP-1 pathway activation. So those are extreme cases\nfor people that are really struggling for weight loss. But the clinical trials and\nthe data that are out there in the general\npopulation now are very, very promising for\nGLP-1 analogues. Yerba mat\u00e9 tea, provided\nit's not the smoked variety-- and I mention that because a\nnumber of people have cued me to the fact that yerba mat\u00e9\nteas come in smoked varieties and nonsmoked varieties. And the smoked\nvarieties are thought to perhaps be carcinogenic. That is, procancer-causing. So I advise people to avoid\nsmoked varieties of yerba mat\u00e9 tea. But yerba mat\u00e9 teas are known\nto stimulate significant amounts of GLP-1 release. And so they can be effective\nas a weight loss tool, mainly by blunting appetite. And again, they do that both\nat the level of the brain and at the level of the gut. Now all of what I\njust told you has been known for some\nperiod of time, but there are new set of\nfindings that were just published in Cell Reports\nMedicine, Cell Press journal, excellent journal-- which indicate exactly\nhow it is that GLP-1 stimulates both satiety and\ncan trigger additional weight loss through other mechanisms. And I find the mechanism to be\nreally interesting and actually really important, given\nsome other topics we've covered on this podcast before. So the basic finding\nis that GLP-1, whether or not it's stimulated\nthrough the release of analogue drug that one is prescribed\nor by drinking yerba mat\u00e9 tea, for instance, and stimulate\nrelease of your own so-called endogenous GLP-1, yes, it makes\nyou feel more full at the level of brain and body. But it turns out it also\nstimulates thermogenesis. Now thermogenesis is\nthe active utilization of more metabolic energy. And fat cells, in particular--\nso-called beige and brown fat cells-- are a potent source of\nthermogenic activity in your body. The basic background is that\nyou have white adipose cells, so white fat cells. You have beige fat cells,\nand you have brown fat cells. And the beige and brown\nones are fat cells that you actually want more of. They are not abundant\nunder your skin. They're abundant really\naround your clavicles and your upper neck. They are the ones\nthat generate heat. And the beige and\nbrownness of them is actually the consequence of\nhaving a lot of mitochondria in those cells. When GLP-1 is elevated\nin your system, it turns out that\nit communicates to those white fat cells\nand helps convert them into beige and brown fat cells. That is, it takes fat\ncells that are not doing anything useful for you\nexcept being stored energy. And I think most\npeople out there would like to have fewer of\nthose white adipose cells. There are few of you\nout there that actually need more of them that\nare too thin, too lean, but most people are suffering\nfrom having too many of these white adipose cells. Well, when you ingest yerba mat\u00e9\ntea or you were to take a GLP-1 analogue or stimulate GLP-1 in\nany number of different ways, yes, you stimulate\nincreased satiety, but you're also stimulating the\nconversion of these white fat cells into beige\nand brown fat cells, which makes you more thermogenic\nand over time raises your basal metabolic rate. So you're burning more\ncalories even at rest. It also makes you\nfeel as if you're more comfortable in colder\nenvironments at rest. This is very much the same\nas the mechanism that's induced when you were to,\nsay, take a cold shower or do regular ice baths or\nget into cold water regularly. That, too, stimulates the\nconversion of white fat cells to beige and brown fat cells. So I like these\nfindings very much because they provide a\nmechanistic coherence. They provide that is a\nreally nice story as to how something like GLP-1 could be\nso effective for weight loss. Yes, on the one hand,\nGLP-1 is reducing appetite, and that, of course, will help\npeople maintain or lose weight. But it's also increasing\nbasal metabolic rate. And we now know how\nthat's accomplished. It's likely accomplished\nat least through this one mechanism by the\nstimulation of conversion of these white fat cells,\nwhich don't do much for us except as energy storage\nunits to these metabolically mitochondrial-rich beige\nand brown fat cells, which you can think of as\nsort of the oil in the candle that allows your furnace, your\nmetabolism to burn at a higher temperature and a higher rate. So that's the mechanism. And the basic tool\ntakeaway is that, if you are somebody who's\ninterested in losing weight and you want to leverage\nthe GLP-1 pathway, drinking a cup or two of yerba\nmat\u00e9 tea early in the day would be a great way to\nstimulate GLP-1 release. There are other ways to\nstimulate GLP-1 release. You can get it through\ncertain forms of exercise. In particular, fasted exercise. This is actually a vote in\nfavor of fasted exercise. There's a debate as\nto whether or not fasted cardio burns more\nfat than nonfasted cardio. And the data basically say\nno, it doesn't really matter. But that doesn't really\ntake into account the longer arc of things\nlike GLP-1 release, so that needs to be\ntaken into consideration. So you could do fasted cardio. You could drink yerba mat\u00e9 tea,\nkeeping in mind that yerba mat\u00e9 tea does contain caffeine. We'll talk more about the\nspecific forms of stimulants including caffeine\nthat mat\u00e9 has. But mat\u00e9 would be a great way\nto stimulate GLP-1 release. And then, of course, for those\nof you that are interested in more robust\nactivation of GLP-1, then perhaps you might want\nto consider some of the new prescription GLP-1 analogues\nthat are out there. But that's a more severe\nstimulus for GLP-1, of course. And for everybody, regardless\nof whether or not you're trying to lose weight, gain\nweight, or maintain weight, I think we're going to be\nhearing a lot more about GLP-1 analogues and drinks and\nsupplements and things of that sort that stimulate GLP-1 in\nthe very near future because it does appear to be a very\nimportant biological mechanism. Before we begin, I'd\nlike to emphasize that this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part\nof my desire and effort to bring zero cost to\nconsumer information about science and\nscience-related tools to the general public. In keeping with\nthat theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Levels. Levels is a program\nthat lets you see how different foods affect\nyour health by giving you real-time feedback on your\ndiet using a continuous glucose monitor. The blood glucose or blood\nsugar is a critical aspect of your immediate and\nlong-term health and, indeed, your feelings of vigor and\nmental clarity and well-being at any moment. One of the key things is to know\nhow different foods and food combinations and\ntiming of food intake is impacting blood glucose. And with Levels,\nyou're able to assess all of that in real time. I tried Levels,\nand what it taught me, for instance, was that\nI can eat certain foods at certain times of day. But if I eat them at\nother times a day, I get a blood sugar crash. It also taught me,\nfor instance, how to space my exercise\nand my food intake. Turns out for me exercising\nfasted is far more beneficial. That's something I\nlearned using Levels, and it's completely transformed\nnot just the spacing and timing of my diet and\nexercise but also use of things like the sauna\nand other activities. It's been a tremendous\nlearning for me that's really shaped an enormous\nnumber of factors in my life that have led to me feeling\nfar more vigorous with far more mental focus and physical\nstrength and endurance. So if you're interested in\nlearning more about Levels and trying a continuous\nglucose monitor yourself, go to levels.link/huberman. Again, that's\nlevels.link/huberman. Today's episode is also\nbrought to us by Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep make smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating, and sleep-tracking capacity. I've talked many\ntimes on this podcast about the critical relationship\nbetween sleep and body temperature. That is, in order to fall\nasleep and stay deeply asleep throughout the night,\nour body temperature needs to drop by\nabout 1 to 3 degrees. And conversely, when we\nwake up in the morning, that is in large part\nbecause of our body heating up by 1 to 3 degrees. Now people have different\ncore body temperatures, and they tend to run colder or\nhotter throughout the night. Eight Sleep allows you\nto adjust the temperature of your sleeping\nenvironment so that you have the optimal temperature\nthat gets you the best night's sleep. I started sleeping on\nan Eight Sleep mattress cover about eight months\nago, and it has completely transformed my sleep. I sleep so much deeper. I wake up far less during the\nmiddle of the night, if at all. And I wake up feeling far\nbetter than I ever have even after the same amount of sleep.

Eight Sleep currently\nships in the USA, Canada, United Kingdom,\nselected countries in the EU, and Australia. Again, that's\neightsleep.com/huberman. Today's episode is also\nbrought to us by ROKA. ROKA makes eyeglasses\nand sunglasses that are of the absolute\nhighest quality. The company was founded by\ntwo all-American swimmers from Stanford. And everything about ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with\nperformance in mind. I've spent a lifetime working on\nthe biology, the visual system. And I can tell you that\nyour visual system has to contend with an enormous\nnumber of challenges in order for you to see clearly,\nfor instance, when you move from a sunny area\nto a shady area and back again, whether or not\nyou're looking at something up close or often to the distance. ROKA understands the\nbiology of the visual system and has designed their\neyeglasses and sunglasses accordingly, so you always\nsee with perfect clarity. ROKA eyeglasses and\nsunglasses were initially designed for activities\nsuch as running and cycling. And indeed, they are\nvery lightweight. Most of the time I\ncan't even remember that they're on my face. They're so lightweight. But the important thing to\nknow about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses is\nthat, while they can be used during\nsports activities, they also have a\nterrific aesthetic, and they can be used just as\nwell for wearing to work or out to dinner, et cetera. If you'd like to try ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses, you can go to ROKA. That's R-O-K-A.com and enter the\ncode Huberman to save 20% off on your first order.

To find the supplements we\ndiscuss on the Huberman Lab podcast, you can go to\nlivemomentous, spelled O-U-S, livemomentous.com/huberman. Huberman. And I should just\nmention that the library of those supplements is\nconstantly expanding. Again, that's\nlivemomentous.com/huberman. Let's talk about caffeine. So as I mentioned\nearlier, caffeine is consumed by basically most\nall adults every single day and consumed at very\nregular times each day. In fact, if you were to take\na look at your caffeine intake or the caffeine intake\nof somebody close to you, what you\nwould realize is that they don't do so well if\ntheir caffeine intake arrives even 10, 20, or 30 minutes past\ntheir expected or usual intake of caffeine. That's pretty\nremarkable, and it brings to mind ideas that\nwe are all, quote unquote, \"addicted to caffeine\"\nor that caffeine is somehow bad. I'm certainly not going to make\nthe argument that caffeine is bad. First of all, I'm a\nregular caffeine user. I wouldn't call myself\na caffeine abuser, but I am a regular\ncaffeine user. And caffeine is known to\nhave certain health benefits. I listed off a few\nof them earlier, but I'll mention those again\nnow before going forward. Caffeine is known to have\ncertain neuroprotective effects. And that is because\nof its ability to increase neuromodulators,\nsuch as dopamine, but also other\nso-called catecholamines like norepinephrine. If you don't know\nwhat those names mean, these are molecules that\nincrease levels of alertness, motivation, and drive. And so then therefore not\nsurprisingly the large scale analyses of the relationship\nbetween depression and caffeine shows that, provided people are\nnot drinking so much caffeine, that it makes them\noverly anxious, that regular intake of\ncaffeine is inversely related to levels of depression. So it may have some\nantidepressant effects. And those could be\ndirect or indirect. What do I mean by that? Well, you can imagine that if\npeople are ingesting caffeine and they are more motivated\nto do work and pursue quality social\ninteractions, then the probability that they will\nhave depression could be lower. It could also be that\nthere are direct effects on the chemical systems\nof the brain that relate to mood and well-being\nthat could offset depression. It is not clear whether\nor not the effects of caffeine in\ncountering depression are direct or indirect. Nonetheless, there's\na relationship there, and it's an interesting\nand positive one. Or I should say\nnegative correlation, positive effect overall on mood\nand well-being, to be exact. Now it's also the\ncase that caffeine can improve mental performance\nand physical performance. This has been demonstrated in\ntens of thousands of studies. I will review a few studies\non this, in particular, today. But to just give\nyou a sense of how caffeine works at the level\nof its timing and impact on mental performance and\nphysical performance, when we ingest caffeine,\nprovided that we don't have a lot of food in our stomach\nand that our blood sugar isn't particularly high, generally,\nwe experience an increase in alertness within\nabout five minutes. And that increase in\nfocus and alertness peaks around 30 minutes after\ningestion of caffeine and persists for as\nlong as 60 minutes. Now this is assuming that one\ntakes caffeine in pill form or drinks the entire\ncaffeine drink within a short period of time. But a little bit\nlater, I'll talk about how you can consume\ncaffeine at regular intervals while doing mental work or\nphysical work in a way that can further increase\nmental performance and physical performance. But let's just touch\non what caffeine intake really does\nfor mental performance and physical performance. Perhaps the most robust\nfinding across all of the studies\nthat I've examined is that caffeine reduces\nour reaction time. That is, it improves\nour reaction time. It doesn't make it longer. It makes it shorter. So for instance, in\na laboratory study where people were asked to hit\na lever every time they hear a tone, you can greatly reduce\nthe time between the tone and the pressing of the lever\nif people ingest caffeine about 30 minutes before\nthey do that task. Now that seems like\na trivial task, but this is also seen in the\ndomain of sports performance and even in cognitive\nperformance, where people have to arrive\nat a particular answer to a question. And the answer to\nthat question has to be pulled from\ntheir memory banks within their brain,\ntheir hippocampus, for instance, a brain\nstructure involved in memory. And if you are asking\npeople, for instance, to remember the capitals of\ndifferent states or cities or to remember certain\nhistorical facts, they will do that at\na particular rate. But if they've ingested\ncaffeine within the hour prior, their ability to\nrecall that information is much, much better. They are faster, and\nit does not appear that accuracy is reduced. In fact, in many cases,\naccuracy is enhanced. And that's because caffeine\nboth works on the reaction time systems of the brain and body. I'll talk about the mechanisms\nfor that in a little bit. But it also stimulates\ncertain neurotransmitters and so-called neuromodulators\nwithin the brain and body that give the neural\ncircuits in the brain that are associated with\nlearning and memory a lower threshold to activation. What does that mean? That means that we are\nbetter able to access the brain circuitry involved\nin learning and memory when we have a certain amount\nof caffeine circulating in our system. So this makes\ncaffeine an incredible performance-enhancing compound. And I could give you\ntens of thousands of examples of this in humans. But before I do that,\nI want to just touch on what we know about the\nexistence of caffeine in nature and what the existence\nof caffeine in nature and its effects on other\nanimals tells us about what caffeine does in humans. Because as I alluded to\nearlier, what caffeine is doing for us is not just\nmaking us more alert, improving our memory, improving\nour reaction time, and so on. It's actually acting as\na powerful reinforcer of experience. And it's acting as not\njust a powerful reinforcer of the caffeine-containing\ndrink that we drink but also the mug that\nit's contained in, plus the person that\nwe might be sitting across from when we consume\nthat caffeine, and so on and so forth. If it's a little\nbit hard for you to conceptualize\nwhat a reinforcer is and why I'm calling\nit a reinforcer, let me spell it out in\nthree specific ways. We often hear about\nthe word reward, and we think, OK, if\nwe do certain things and we like the outcome,\nthen those certain things are rewarded. Right? If we're doing something,\nwe receive praise. The praise is the reward. And therefore, we\nare more likely to do that thing in the future. In fact, a lot of\nparenting is like that. And a lot of life is like that. However, when we\nhear the word reward, we often think about something\nthat feels good to us. And certainly, if we've worked\nhard and we get some praise, that's natural for the\npraise to feel good to us. Or for instance, if\nwe work very hard and we get a certain outcome-- a trophy, a financial outcome,\na degree outcome, recognition, et cetera-- all of those\ncan act as rewards, but those are all\nconscious rewards. We are aware that\nthey are happening. Reinforcers are a little bit\ndifferent because the word reinforcement can apply to\nconscious rewards of the sort that I just described,\nbut there are also many ways in which\ncaffeine stimulates the release of chemicals in our\nbody that act as reinforcers. But those reinforcers\nare subconscious. That is, we are\nnot aware that they cause this preference\nfor the activities that cause their release. So the study I'm about\nto describe beautifully, I believe,\nencapsulates how is it that humans came\nto consume caffeine and why caffeine exists in\nnature and the powerful effects of caffeine as a reinforcing\nagent both in animals, insects, and in you and me. And the title of the\npaper is \"Caffeine and floral nectar enhances a\npollinator's memory of reward.\" Keep in mind that caffeine\nis made from plants. Some of you will say, duh,\nbut I think some of us don't realize that the reason\nwhy there is caffeine in coffee is because coffee\ncomes from a plant. It's a coffee\nbean, certain teas, which, of course, are\nplants that people brew. Caffeine is contained in those\nteas, such as yerba mat\u00e9. Well, why would this\nbitter substance-- because, in fact, caffeine is quite\nbitter in high concentrations. Why would this bitter\nsubstance be something that insects or animals\nwould want to consume at all? It turns out that,\nin most plants, caffeine is present in\nsmall enough quantities that insects and other animals--\nand in fact, we can't actually taste the caffeine. If I were to give you a\nlittle bit of pure caffeine, yes, it would be a\nstimulant for you, but you would say\nthat it tasted awful. It's in a category of compounds\nthat would strongly stimulate the bitter receptors\non your tongue and would make you\ncringe and pucker and essentially walk away from\nwhatever it is that contain that caffeine and from\nthe experience that contain that caffeine. Well, in nature, caffeine\nis present in very low concentrations or is\nmasked by other flavors within flowers,\nbeans, and plants. And what this paper\nreally points to is that caffeine\nin nature is acting as a reinforcer for bees that\nare consuming different nectar. So the way that it works\nis that bees, of course, go from flower to flower, and\nthey are consuming the nectar. They are bringing nectar\nand pollen back to the hive, and that provides critical\nnourishment for the bee colony. The bees are foraging in a\nway that includes information about color, in particular,\nultraviolet color, things that we can't see\nbut they can see, because they have different\nphotoreceptors than we do. And what the study shows is\nthat plants and nectars that contain very small\namounts of caffeine are the preferred\nsources of food for bees. And the study is\nbeautiful because they were able to confirm that they\ncould mask the caffeine taste. So they know that the\nbees are not preferring the taste of caffeine. But what they do is\nthey pair caffeine with different food\nsources for the bees, then they remove the caffeine. And what they find is that\nthe bees very strongly prefer flavors that\ncontain caffeine, not because they could taste the\ncaffeine but rather for the way that those caffeine-containing\nflavors made the bees feel. So how do those\ncaffeine-containing flavors make the bees feel? The same way that\nthey make you and I feel, a little bit\nmore alert and thereby able to do more work. For the bee, the more\nwork is the consumption of more food, which then has\na further reinforcing effect. So what we're really\ntalking about here is the fact that A, caffeine\nexists in nature, in plants. It exists in concentrations that\nare very low, so low, in fact, that they are not detectable to\nthe taste receptors of insects, and, in many cases, to the\ntaste receptors of humans. And, of course, there\ncan be high levels of caffeine in a plant. But if the plant also\ncontains compounds that mask the\nflavor of caffeine, well then, those plants\nare going to essentially be even stronger reinforcers\nfor the flavor of the plant, OK? So now we're talking\nabout strong flavors plus strong neurostimulant\neffects of caffeine. And the most\nimportant point here is that all of these effects\nof caffeine are subconscious. It is not because the bee or\nyou likes the taste of caffeine. In fact, most people, when they\ntake their first sip of coffee, they find it taste bitter\nand kind of noxious. They don't like it. You may not even remember that\nbecause it happened so long ago and because caffeine is\nsuch a strong reinforcer that very quickly you come\nto like the taste of coffee. You might even come to like\nthe feeling of your mug in your hand. You might even come to\nlike the smell of coffee and so on and so forth. And that's because\ncaffeine stimulates the release of certain\nneurochemicals in the brain, in particular, dopamine\nand acetylcholine, two neuromodulators\nthat increase our focus and alertness and our\nfeelings of well-being. A little bit later,\nI'll tell you that caffeine stimulates\nthe release of dopamine in a way that's\nvery much distinct from the classical\ndopamine pathway associated with addiction and reward. In fact, we can\nthink of caffeine as having a somewhat privileged\naccess to the reward systems. I'll give you a bit of a\nhint of where this is going. Caffeine stimulates the release\nof dopamine and acetylcholine not within the classic so-called\nmesolimbic reward pathway. That's just fancy nerd\nspeak for the reward pathways of the brain. They're associated with\nthings like sex and food and drugs of abuse, like\ncocaine and methamphetamine. But rather, caffeine\nseems to stimulate the release of dopamine in\nthe parts of the brain that are associated with\nalertness and cognition, meaning the forebrain. This is very important. We have multiple dopamine\nsystems in the brain and body, and caffeine seems to\nstimulate dopamine directly within the components of the\nbrain that are associated with clarity of\nthought and well-being, but more so clarity of thought. Now, I'm also talking\nabout caffeine as a strong reinforcer in that\nit makes you feel good overall. And it does. And that suggests that it\nalso taps into the more classic reward pathway. But it does that in a very\ninteresting and frankly almost diabolical way. When we regularly\ningest caffeine, it stimulates the increase\nin dopamine receptors at multiple sites throughout\nthe brain but, in particular, within the reward\npathways of the brain. So not the areas\nof the brain that are associated with focus\nand clarity of thought and cognition. It does that, but it\nis also increasing the level of dopamine receptors\nin the reward pathway. And what that means is that,\nfor any dopamine that's released in response to\na positive experience, social experience, or any\nnumber of the other things that can stimulate\ndopamine release, there are more receptors,\nmore parking spots, if you will, for that\ndopamine to arrive at and to exert its increases in\nmood, increases in motivation, and overall feelings of\ndrive and excitement. So there are four ways\nthat caffeine works that we need to understand. First of all, caffeine acts\nas a reinforcing agent. It increases the\nprobability that you will return to and engage\nin a certain activity or consume a certain\nbeverage or food. Second of all,\ncaffeine increases dopamine and\nacetylcholine, which are both neuromodulators\nin the forebrain, which helps us improve our ability to\nthink, to modify our rule sets. That is, to adjust\nour strategies for different social\nsituations and mental demands and physical demands. And third, it increases\nthe number and efficacy of dopamine receptors in the\nreward pathways of the brain. That is, it makes things\nthat would feel pretty good feel even better. And fourth, caffeine\nacts as an antagonist to adenosine, which offsets\nthe sleepiness that we would otherwise feel from the\naccumulation of adenosine that occurs as we are awake\nfor more and more hours throughout the day. So let's talk first\nabout caffeine as a reinforcing agent. Again, this was first most\nbeautifully demonstrated in this study on honeybees\nwhere the bees prefer nectars that contain caffeine. And that all makes\nperfect sense in terms of the ecology of bees and\nflowers that contain nectar. There's an advantage, at\nleast in terms of adaptation, that the flower benefits because\nof distribution of things from the flower, which is good\nfor the flowers and the bees benefit, because\nthey're getting food. And so there's a kind\nof a symbiosis there. But with humans, we're consuming\ncaffeine-containing beverages for our sake. I don't think we\nhave it in mind, nor do the bees have\nit in mind, frankly, that we're trying to\npreserve the plants that provide the caffeine. I think we would all suffer,\nor I should say 90% of adults would suffer greatly if all\nthe caffeine-containing coffee and tea plants were\ngone, certainly. But most of us are not\nconsuming coffees and teas and caffeine-containing\nfoods because we're thinking about the\nplants they come from and we want to\nhelp those plants. We're thinking about how\nwe want to help ourselves. And yet the point of the\nreinforcing effects of caffeine are that they are\nlargely subconscious. We are not aware of them. Now you might say,\nno, that's not true. When I drink caffeine, it\nmakes me feel really good. So I'm aware that it\nmakes me feel good. In order to illustrate how\nreinforcement really works, let me give you the\ncounter example, which would be an aversive agent. So we have reinforcing agents\nand we have aversive agents. Let's say that there were\ncompounds in nature that exist in plants that are aversive. And indeed, they are. And let's say that\nthese compounds were present at such\nlow concentrations that you couldn't taste them. Let's say you wake\nup in the morning and you go to your\nrefrigerator and you open it up and you are thirsty,\nand so you reach for a nice rich red-containing\nbeverage in a glass jar. Maybe it looks like\ncranberry juice or something of that sort. Or even a nice clear\nglass of water. It looks like a jug of\nwater or a glass of water, and you drink that. Taste fine to you. Maybe even tastes great to you. And then let's say\nabout 30 minutes later, you feel a little queasy,\nyou feel a little off, you feel like going\nback to sleep, you just don't feel very good. You don't know why,\nbut your nervous system is a predictive machine, and it\nhas a process in which it back integrates. Or I should say\nintegrates backwards into your immediate experience\nthat preceded that not so good feeling. We can reliably say that there\nis a much lower probability that the next day\nwhen you wake up that you would reach\nfor that same beverage or for that same container even. And maybe if you're in\na novel environment, maybe you're staying in an\nAirbnb or a hotel or something of that sort, you might even\nfind that you don't really like the kitchen in which\nyou consume that beverage in the first place. And you don't know why. And unless you got very,\nvery sick the day before, it's unlikely that you would\nhave such a strong response that you would entirely avoid,\nfor instance, water or glass jars containing\nliquids, et cetera. Let's say you went back\nto the refrigerator and you consume a beverage\nagain and you just didn't feel so well,\nyou felt less good than you normally would. Well, even without\nany ability to taste what's in that beverage and\neven without any understanding of what was happening to\nyou at a conscious level, there is a very,\nvery high probability that you will avoid drinking\nthat particular beverage and certainly at that location\nand in the same volume in the subsequent days. That's just the way that\naversive agents work. And they work by way\nof activating neurons in the gut that communicate with\nareas in the brain that give us this feeling of queasiness. And for some of\nyou hearing this, that pathway and\nthat association with times in which you felt\nqueasy and as if you wanted to vomit is so powerful that\nyou might even be feeling some of that symptomology now. For certain people that's going\nto be increased salivation which precedes vomiting,\nwe know that there's a class of neurons\nin the brain relate to an area called area postrema\nthat actually stimulates vomiting. And if I keep\ntalking about this, I'll probably feel\nlike I want to vomit, so I'm going to move on\nfrom this in a moment. So when we ingest\ncaffeine-containing beverages and foods, it's the\nexact opposite scenario as to what I just described. Caffeine, as a\nreinforcer, makes us feel slightly better\nor a lot better in the immediate minutes and\nhours after we ingest it. So it's acting as\na reinforcing agent not just while you are under\nthe effects of caffeine but for the things that preceded\nthe ingestion of caffeine, which is why you\nreturn again and again to caffeine-containing\nbeverages, such as coffee and tea or maybe even foods\nthat contain caffeine, even if the taste of those\nfoods is not something that you would otherwise\nconsider, especially delicious. In fact, most people when they\ntake their first sip of coffee or tea or other\ncaffeine-containing beverage, they find it to be very bitter. And that's not because\nof the taste of caffeine. It's because of the taste of\nthe beverage itself independent of caffeine. However, when caffeine\nis present in there, they come to prefer that\ntaste over most all tastes. In fact, they will, as\nI mentioned earlier, will invest a lot of financial\nresources and time and energy to make sure that they\nget that beverage. What they're trying to make sure\nis not that they get that taste but that they get the caffeine. It is that positively\nreinforcing. And the taste therefore takes on\nnew significance, new meaning, and we come to associate\nit as positive. And in fact, most of\nus, including myself, love the taste of espresso,\nlove the taste of coffee, love the taste of yerba mat\u00e9\neven if the initial taste, the very first time that\nwe consume that beverage, was either neutral or negative. And that is all because of\nthe reinforcing properties of caffeine. And then, of course, there\nare the more direct actions of caffeine. That is, the faster\nactions of caffeine. And just to list those off\nagain very briefly so that you have them in mind going\nforward, caffeine also increases the release of\ndopamine and acetylcholine, both of which are\nneuromodulators in the forebrain, which\nincreases clarity of thought and your ability to rule\nswitch, your ability to move from one\ncontext to another and change and understand\nthe rules of engagement, social engagement, physical\nengagement, mental engagement, and so forth. And as I mentioned\nbefore, caffeine also increases the number of\ndopamine receptors in the reward pathway, such that any good\nthing that happens to you. Any positive experience\nthat you have will have a more potent effect\non your feelings of well-being. And last but certainly\nnot least, caffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist. It reduces your feelings\nof lethargy and fatigue and your desire to\nsleep by parking in the receptors for\nadenosine and not allowing adenosine to have\nits pro-sleepy, if you will, effects on your brain and body. I'd like to take a quick\nbreak and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG1,\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic\nGreens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking\nAthletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens\nonce or usually twice a day is that it gets\nme the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by\ngut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the\nimmune system, and basically all the biological\nsystems of our body to strongly impact our\nimmediate and long-term health. And those probiotics\nand Athletic Greens are optimal and vital\nfor microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic\nGreens contains a number of adaptogens,\nvitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs are met. And it tastes great. If you'd like to\ntry Athletic Greens, you can go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman, and they'll give you five\nfree travel packs that make it really easy to mix up\nAthletic Greens while you're on the road, in the\ncar, on the plane, et cetera. And they'll give you a year\nsupply of Vitamin D3K2. Again, that's\nathleticsgreen.com/huberman to get the five free travel\npacks and the year supply of Vitamin D3K2. I'd like to just briefly\ntalk about adenosine and some of its molecular features. And again, if you don't have\na background in biology, don't worry. I promise to make this\nvery clear to everyone. First of all, caffeine is\nwhat's called a methylxantine. It's a plant alkaloid. That's why caffeine\nitself is very bitter. Again, if I were to give\nyou just the tiniest little bit of pure\ncaffeine, you would find it to be extremely aversive. So these plants that have\nsnuck small enough amounts of caffeine into\nthem or that have masked the flavor of\ncaffeine with other flavors such that bees and humans\nwant to consume them, while we don't know what\nplants think, it does seem very diabolical\nand very clever in that we are seeking out these\ncaffeine-containing plants, beverages, and foods even\nthough caffeine itself is this alkaloid that\nis very, very bitter. Methylxantine--\nthat is caffeine-- binds to adenosine receptors. And there are really two\ntypes of adenosine receptors. There are these so-called A1\nreceptors and the A2 receptors. And they are present in\ndifferent parts of the brain and body at different levels. We don't have to get too\nfar into receptor subtypes. More importantly\nto understand is that adenosine makes us feel\ntired because of the way that it taps into\nthe ATP pathway. The ATP pathway is central to\nenergy production and feelings of overall energy in\nour brain and body in all cells and organ systems. When caffeine binds to\nadenosine receptors, it prevents adenosine\nfrom breaking down certain components of the\nenergy production pathway. And the net consequence of\nthat is increased cyclic AMP. So basically, when\nwe ingest caffeine, we are biasing\nour system towards the pro-energetic aspects\nof these cellular pathways. Now it's really important to\nunderstand that, in biology, even if you block a\nreceptor or you prevent the activity of an enzyme and-- at least, in this\ncase, you end up with more cyclic\nAMP, more energy. You're not really\ngetting more energy. You're actually borrowing\nenergy against an overall system that is frankly nonnegotiable. What do I mean by that? Well, let's say that you were\nto wake up after six or eight hours of sleep and to\ndrink a lot of caffeine and keep drinking caffeine\nthroughout the day blocking those adenosine receptors. Yes, you'll offset fatigue. You'll offset sleepiness\nbecause that adenosine simply can't function. But at the point where the\ncaffeine becomes dislodged from the adenosine\nreceptors, you will have a massive glut,\na backlog of adenosine, and you will feel\nextra, extra sleepy. So really, there's no\nway to create more energy in your system. Really, what you're\ndoing is you're changing the timing in which\nthe sleepy signals and the more energetic signals are arriving. And this is really important\nto understand as the backdrop to the various tools\nthat we're going to get into next, in which you\ncan use caffeine for enhancing mental performance and\nphysical performance and other aspects of health. But it's very important\nto understand this concept that, when you wake up in the\nmorning provided that you slept well and enough\nthe night before, your levels of adenosine\nwill be about as low as they will ever be. Actually, in order to get\nyour adenosine levels really bottomed out, you want to avoid\ncaffeine in the first 90 to 120 minutes after waking. We'll talk about why that\nis because it turns out there's a way to\ncompletely clear adenosine out of your system in the\nhour or so after waking. But for most people,\nadenosine levels are going to be\nclose to their lowest after a good night's sleep. But there's really no\nnegotiating the accumulation of adenosine that's\ngoing to occur and going to bias you towards\nfeeling more sleepy than you would. Otherwise, that's going to\noccur throughout the day. There's really no way\nto eliminate adenosine. All you can really do\nis block its function. So it's sort of like borrowing\nenergy against the fatigue that you will inevitably feel. Now this actually\nhas a very important socioeconomical relevance. Before caffeine was regularly\nconsumed by human beings, we were really slaves\nto the light/dark cycle. And this was especially\ntrue before the presence of artificial lighting. But even before the advent\nof artificial lighting, humans were largely constrained\nto the outside light/dark cycle. We need to be active during the\nday and working during the day, and we need to be\nasleep at night. Caffeine allows us\nto divorce ourselves from that circadian cycle. Circadian just\nmeans about 24 hour. Caffeine allows us to do\nthat at least somewhat by way of increasing our alertness. That is, spiking our\nalertness at various times throughout the day\nand even at night. This is how we can have\nshift workers, for instance, that can sleep during\nthe day and then drink a strong cup of\ncoffee at 8:00 PM and then work into the night. That ability completely\ntransformed our society. Now, of course, the\nhealthiest schedule-- and we know this with certainty. The healthiest schedule\nfor brain and body is going to be alert during the\ndaytime and asleep at night. There's no question about that. Shift workers run into all\nsorts of health problems. And thank you shift workers\nfor doing the important work that you do. We need you. Air traffic controllers,\nparamedics, firefighters, police officers, et cetera. But we know that there are\nserious health consequences, negative health consequences,\nthat is, for shift workers. But for most people out\nthere, about 95% of people follow a typical schedule. They're awake during the\nday and asleep at night. And yet it used to\nbe before the advent of caffeine-containing\nbeverages that, if you were sleepy in the\nafternoon, you either had to take a nap or\nbattle that sleepiness, that your activity rhythms\nand your sleep rhythms were governed by these circadian\nchanges in availability of sunlight and when you slept. And you just didn't\nhave the ability to ingest a beverage\nthat would increase your levels of alertness\nbecause you block adenosine. So this is important\nto understand that, nowadays,\nwe certainly live in a time in which we use-- in fact, 90% or more of\nadults and half or more of adolescents and\nteenagers use caffeine as a way to negotiate\nwith, to borrow against this natural pattern\nof adenosine making us sleepy. But again, you're\njust offsetting the effects of sleepiness\nthat adenosine causes. You can't eliminate\nthe adenosine entirely. The important point\nis that adenosine as a pro-sleep molecule\nis a nonnegotiable aspect of your biology. In fact, it's so nonnegotiable\nthat, every 24 hours, you are going to release\nadenosine, and you're going to release adenosine in\ndirect proportion to how long you've been awake. So the longer you've\nbeen awake, the more adenosine circulating\nin your system. There are really only a handful\nof ways to completely clear out adenosine. The major one\nbeing to get sleep. The other is to take a short\nnap, which, of course, is sleep, but it's shallow sleep. Or non-sleep deep\nrest, so-called NSDR, has been shown to reduce\nlevels of adenosine. And there are certain things\nsuch as viewing morning sunlight, which because of\nits effects on cortisol, can quote unquote,\n\"clear out adenosine.\" We'll talk about this in\nmore detail in a few minutes. And there's also evidence that\ncertain forms of exercise, provided that it's\nbrief and intense, can also reduce adenosine,\nnot just block its effects. Now that we've talked about some\nof the incredible mechanisms by which caffeine changes\nour experience of life, increases alertness\nand mood, et cetera, I want to talk about the\nuse of caffeine as a tool. Now caffeine is a very\npotent and useful tool for enhancing mental\nhealth, physical health, and performance. But there are certain\nconsiderations one has to keep in mind,\nin particular, dose. Now, first off,\nnot everybody will respond to the same dose\nof caffeine the same way, but we can reliably say\nthat your body weight is a good measure by\nwhich you can estimate what a healthy, useful\ndose of caffeine would be. So for most people,\ningesting 1 to 3 milligrams of caffeine per\nkilogram of body weight is going to be the\nrange in which caffeine can have positive effects\nwithout making us feel overly anxious and give us that\nfeeling that we're jumping out of our skin and\nturn the otherwise positive experience of\ncaffeine into an aversive one. For those of you that aren't\nfamiliar with thinking in terms of kilograms and\nnormally think in pounds, I'll just quickly give you\nsome general estimations that, for instance, 100\nkilograms equals 220 pounds. So for me, I weigh\n100 kilograms. That means that 1\nto 3 milligrams-- again, milligrams,\nthousandth of a gram. 1 to 3 milligrams of caffeine\nper kilogram of body weight would mean for me. I could safely ingest 100 to\n300 milligrams of caffeine in a single dose,\nin a single drink, if that's the way\nI'm consuming it, or pill form if that's the\nway that I'm consuming it. And it's very likely that\nthat will be a tolerable dose. However, if you are\nnot somebody that's accustomed to drinking\ncaffeine on a regular basis, I suggest you start on the\nlower end of that 1 to 3 milligrams per kilogram\nof body weight range. So for instance,\nif you're somebody who weighs 50 kilograms, that's\napproximately 110 pounds. And you would be\npretty comfortable ingesting somewhere between 50\nand 150 milligrams of caffeine. So what I recommend is that\npeople who are considering using caffeine as a tool or who\nare already ingesting caffeine, start to think about\nthe dosage of caffeine that you are ingesting\nor plan to ingest and the timing in which\nyou ingest that caffeine relative to certain tasks\nthroughout your day, your waking, and your sleep. And we'll talk about\nthat in just a moment. But the first step for\nyou is to figure out how much you weigh\nin kilograms and then to go to that number of 1\nto 3 milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight. And that's a good\nrange in which you might want to explore\nthe use of caffeine in a single application,\nmeaning a single dose. Now, I do realize that\nsome people out there are drinking coffee all day long\nor having coffee in the morning and again in the afternoon. What I'm referring to here\nis the ingestion of caffeine in a single bout, right? 1 cup of coffee or 2 cups\nof coffee, for instance, to achieve that 100\nto 300 milligram range if that's what's\nappropriate for your body weight. But to avoid any confusion,\nwhen I talk about dosage of caffeine, what I'm\nreally talking about is not the total amount of\ncaffeine ingested per day. I'm talking about\nthe total amount of caffeine ingested in one\nsitting or setting, that is. And if you're somebody who's\ndrinking caffeine multiple times throughout the day, you\ncan imagine-- for instance, let's say the\nappropriate dose for you in order to get an enhancement\nin mental performance or physical performance\nis 200 milligrams. And you are somebody who's\ndoing some work in the morning, and you want to have\nthat lift in the morning to be able to focus better. And you're doing some physical\nexercise in the afternoon or vice versa that you\nwould ingest 200 milligrams of caffeine at two\nseparate times per day separated by about four hours. Now you don't have\nto separate them. You could put them two\nhours apart, for instance. But we'll talk about half-life\nof caffeine and so forth. Just keep in mind that, if\nyou're ingesting 200 milligrams of caffeine and that's the\nappropriate dose for you based on your body\nweight and then you are ingesting another 200\nmilligrams of caffeine an hour later, you are effectively\ningesting approximately 400 milligrams of caffeine,\nwhich is going to start exceeding the dose\nin which you can normally tolerate without feeling\nanxious and jittery. With all of that\nsaid, there is a range of tolerance for caffeine\nthat's based on two things. One is a preexisting disposition\nthat is whether or not your genetics and nervous system\nand the backdrop of your life, how much stress\nyou're experiencing tends to make you feel more\nanxious and alert and jittery before you ingest any caffeine. And the other is how so-called\ncaffeine-adapted you are. We often hear about tolerance. Tolerance means\nsomething very specific. It's the ability to ingest\nmore and more of something with a plateau that is a no\nincrease or an actual reduction in the effectiveness\nof that thing. But here we're not really\ntalking about tolerance to caffeine. What we're talking about\nis being caffeine-adapted. A simple way to\nunderstand whether or not your caffeine-adapted or not\nis that, if you drink caffeine and it tends to\nincrease your heart rate and make you feel more alert\nand a bit more anxious, then chances are you are\nnot caffeine-adapted, provided the amount of caffeine\nis within the healthy range for you, that is, the ranges\nwe talked about a moment ago. However, here's somebody\nwho drinks caffeine and you actually feel\nalert and relaxed, chances are you are\ncaffeine-adapted. And so at various times\nduring today's episode, I'll talk about people\nwho are caffeine-adapted and people who are\nnot caffeine-adapted. We'll talk about the use of\ncaffeine every other day. I know a few habitual caffeine\ndrinkers including myself, just the simple mention of\nthat probably sounds aversive. But there is actually\ngreat utility to using caffeine every other\nday as opposed to every day. But just keep in\nmind that some people will drink caffeine and not get\nmuch of a lift from it at all. Other people will\ndrink caffeine, and they will feel extremely\nanxious even at dosages far lower than that 1 to\n3 milligrams per kilogram of body weight range that\nI described a moment ago. So you have to take into\naccount individual differences. That said, 1 to 3 milligrams of\ncaffeine per kilogram of body weight for a given sitting. For your morning coffee or\nyour morning yerba mat\u00e9 tea is a good range from\nwhich to start. And I do encourage you\nto go online and look up the various beverages and\nfoods that you might be eating that contain caffeine. For instance, some people\nare surprised to discover that the coffee that they get\nfrom some of the more standard popular vendors out\nthere, the small coffee or the medium\ncoffee, for instance, can contain as much as 400 to\n600 milligrams of caffeine. And the large\ncoffee that is often sold at those\ncommercial vendors can contain as much as 1 gram,\n1,000 milligrams, of caffeine. Now you may be\nadapted to that such that it doesn't make\nyou feel anxious, but if you wonder why\nyou feel irritable and you get a headache\nwhen you don't get that caffeine or\nthat amount of caffeine at precisely the time that\nyou're used to getting it each day, that's because\nyou are consuming quite large quantities of\ncaffeine on a regular basis. So I do recommend whether or not\nyou drink soda or coffee or tea that you figure out\nthe source of that. OK, so figure out what\nvendor you purchase it from, what kind of coffee,\nand go online and spend a little bit of time\nbecause the information is out there to discover\nwhat levels of caffeine you're actually ingesting. Now if you happen to be\ningesting more than 1 to 3 milligrams per kilogram\nof body weight of caffeine, that's not necessarily bad. However, you do want to\nbe careful about ingesting very high levels of caffeine\nover long periods of time in your life because there can\nbe issues that start to arise. In particular, a bias\ntowards higher levels of anxiety and depletion\nof certain electrolytes. Because caffeine\nis a diuretic can cause you to lose sodium and\nother things of that sort. And also just from simply\na dependent standpoint, it does appear that if you\ningest high levels of caffeine that is exceeding the\ndosages that normally you could get away with\nand get just as much mental-enhancing and\nphysical-enhancing benefits that you can cause\nsome disruption to the microvasculature. You can bias yourself towards\nheadaches, anxiety attacks, and you can become\nactually quite irritable when you're not getting those\nhigher levels of caffeine. So I do encourage\nyou to figure out not just what an appropriate\ncaffeine dosage would be for you but also\nhow much caffeine you might already be ingesting. The first tool I'd\nlike to talk about is one that I've\nmentioned before on this podcast several times. And it's something that\nif you haven't heard of will be very useful to you. And if you have heard\nthis tool before, I'm going to add some\nadditional features to the description\nof this tool that should make this\nworthwhile for you as well. And that is to delay\nyour caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes after\nwaking up on most days. And I'll be very\nclear as to days in which you might want\nto ingest caffeine more closely to when you wake up. Why would you want to delay\nyour caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes after waking? The answer to that\nis very simple. Many people wake\nup in the morning. They drink caffeine within\n10, 20, 30, sometimes within 2 minutes of waking. And they feel more\nalert naturally. That makes sense because\nof the effects of caffeine in blocking the\neffects of adenosine that I talked about\nearlier and its effects on other\nneurotransmitter systems. But then what they find is\nthat, in the early afternoon, in particular, after lunch,\nthey experience a dramatic dip in their overall levels of\nenergy, the so-called afternoon crash. And in most cases, the\nway they respond to that is to ingest more\ncaffeine, which indeed can increase their\nlevels of mood and alertness. However, as we'll\nsoon talk about, there is a problem\nwith ingesting caffeine in the afternoon if it\nfalls within 8 or 10 or dare I even say 12\nhours of going to sleep. And that is, the caffeine\ningested in the afternoon-- for most everybody, let's say\nfor 95-plus percent of people-- disrupts the\narchitecture and quality of their nighttime sleep. And I should say that\nit doesn't necessarily impact their ability to fall\nasleep and maybe even sleep through the night but that the\ndepth and quality of that sleep is disrupted by consuming\ncaffeine in the afternoon. A little bit later,\nI'll talk about how you can offset some of\nthose negative effects if you absolutely require\ncaffeine in the afternoon. But there's a huge advantage\nto restricting your caffeine intake to the early\npart of your day but not consuming caffeine\nwithin the first 90 to 120 minutes after waking. In fact, many people find that\nif they delay their caffeine intake to 90 to 120\nminutes after waking up that they feel more\nalert in the morning, and they completely avoid\nthat afternoon crash. Now that said, many\npeople, including myself, do need a short nap\nor non-sleep deep rest or other form of relaxation\nfor 10 to 30 minutes in the afternoon. That is natural and healthy. I'm not referring\nto the need for that when I refer to the\nso-called afternoon crash. What I'm talking about\nin the afternoon crash is a inability to recover\nenergy and focus and a need to consume more caffeine just to\nmake it through the afternoon. By delaying caffeine intake to\n90 to 120 minutes after waking, there are a couple of things\nthat are accomplished. First of all, you offset\nthat afternoon crash. And this is an effect that\nmany people experience the very first time they\nstart delaying their caffeine intake to 90 to 120\nminutes after waking. And the reason this works\nso well is the following. As I mentioned\nearlier, adenosine is a molecule that builds up\nthe longer that we are awake. It is a molecule that\nis reduced or cleared from our system by sleep. So when we emerge\nfrom sleep regardless of how long we've slept,\nour adenosine levels are lower than they\nwere when we went to sleep the previous night. If you slept well\nenough and long enough, those adenosine levels\ncan be very, very low, but they are never\ncompletely zero. When you wake up in\nthe morning, even if you're one of these people\nthat springs out of bed and is ready to attack the\nday-- and here I'm certainly not describing myself. I'm not one of those people. I tend to wake fairly slowly. But if you're one of those\nspring up and attack the day or you're one of\nthe people who moves more slowly into your\nday, regardless, there's still some residual\nadenosine in your system. And this is\nparticularly the case if you did not get enough\nsleep or enough depth of sleep the night before. The correct ratio is a slow-wave\nsleep and rapid eye movement sleep. And for those of you\ninterested in optimizing sleep, I'll just refer you to our\nmaster your sleep episode of the Huberman Lab podcast,\nthe perfect your sleep episode of the Huberman Lab podcast. And we have a tool kit for sleep\nall of which are available, zero cost, time-stamped, et\ncetera at hubermanlab.com. You wake up in the morning. And your adenosine levels are\nlow, but they're not zero. And if you didn't sleep that\nwell or deeply enough the night before, you're going to have\nmore adenosine in your system. You might think\nthe logical thing to do is therefore\nto drink caffeine and to block the\nadenosine that's there. But what happens\nif you do that is there's an accumulation, a\nsort of glut of adenosine that hangs around. And then in the afternoon, when\nthe effects of that caffeine start to wear off,\nyou will experience the so-called afternoon crash. As I mentioned\nearlier, there is a way to clear out the adenosine\nthat's present when you wake up in the morning and to\nclear it out essentially completely without just\nblocking its receptors and letting it accumulate\nor hang around. And the way to do that\nis to deliberately spike your cortisol. Now, many of you have heard of\ncortisol, the so-called stress hormone, as a bad thing. And indeed, chronically elevated\ncortisol is a bad thing. It depletes your immune system. It's bad for\npsychosocial effects. It tends to make us feel\nanxious and on and on. But cortisol itself is not bad. Cortisol is wonderful. Cortisol enhances the\nefficiency of the immune system. It makes us alert and focused. It stimulates our metabolism. It does a huge number of\npositive things, provided that it is released in\na circadian fashion. That is, at the\nappropriate times every 24 hours and that it tends\nto peak very close to waking. In fact, one of the reasons\nyou wake up in the morning, assuming that you weren't\nwoken up by some noise or sleeping in an environment\nthat's too warm, et cetera, is that your cortisol\nlevels start to rise. And shortly after waking,\nyour cortisol levels will start to reach their peak. And when I refer to\na cortisol pulse, that's just biology\nnerd speak for a rise and peak in cortisol. You want that cortisol pulse\nto occur early in the day close to waking, and you want that\nfor a couple of reasons. First of all, if you don't\nrestrict that cortisol pulse to early in the\nday, it will tend to bleed into the\nlater parts of the day. And actually, a late\nshifted cortisol peak is one of the\nhallmark signatures of depression,\nlow-level depression, and serious depression. And it can start\nto disrupt sleep and certainly can\ndisrupt mood metabolism and your immune system. So you want that cortisol\npeak early in the day. How do you ensure\nthat that happens? Well, you wake up\nin the morning. And whether or not you're\na bounce-out-of-bed type or you're more groggy, you kind\nof wade slowly into the day type like I am, you wake up,\nand you don't ingest caffeine. Fine and, in fact,\nbeneficial to hydrate with water and electrolytes. Terrific. In fact, I would\nsay necessary to get bright light in your eyes\nideally from sunlight. I've talked about\nthis many, many times before on the podcast. If you wake up before\nthe sun comes out, then turn on bright\nartificial lights. But then certainly once the sun\nis out and even on cloudy days, in fact, especially on cloudy\ndays, get outside for anywhere from 5 to 20, maybe\neven 30 minutes. Do some work outside, take\nyour breakfast outside if you're a breakfast eater. Get something done outside even\nif it's just to get outside and get bright\nlight in your eyes. Why? Well, because it's\nbeen shown in studies on humans that getting\nbright light in your eyes in the first hour after\nwaking or as soon as possible after waking increases the\npeak of that cortisol pulse by 50%, 5-0. And that cortisol pulse, yes,\nincreases mood, yes, increases alertness, but it does one\nother very important thing, which is that, through\nan indirect pathway, it can clear out any\nresidual adenosine that might be present in your\nsystem when you wake up in the morning. Again, this is going to be\nespecially important for those of you that are not\ngetting as much sleep or as much quality\nsleep as you would like. It's going to be very important\nfor you to get that morning bright light ideally\nfrom sunlight, get that cortisol peak going. Other ways to increase\nthat cortisol peak would be to do some\nphysical activity. If you don't have time to do\na full workout, well then, getting some movement-- 10 minutes of\nskipping rope or even 5 minutes of skipping rope\nor jumping jacks or walking if that's all you have time\nfor ideally while getting the sunlight in your eyes. But that's going to zero\nout the adenosine present in your system. If, however, you were to\nwake up and immediately drink caffeine-- caffeine itself can\nstimulate the release of cortisol a little bit\nmore than it would otherwise be present in your system. But by blocking those\nadenosine receptors and because of the\nindirect effects of caffeine on the\ncortisol system, you actually are reducing\nthe clearance of adenosine that would otherwise occur. So I realize that's a mouthful. Just to be very\nclear, if you wake up and you ingest\ncaffeine right away, you're blocking the\nadenosine receptor, but you're not clearing it out. You're also preventing cortisol\nfrom having its normal increase and rise such that it can\ndirectly clear out adenosine because cortisol can\nclear out adenosine. And that's what you want. You want to be at\nmaximum alertness and focus in your morning\nand throughout your day. And by delaying your caffeine to\n90 to 120 minutes after waking, you set up your system so that\nyou get that morning cortisol peak. Ideally, a peak that's\neven greater because you're getting your bright\nlight viewing. And then when you ingest your\ncaffeine 90 to 120 minutes after waking, not only will\nyou be craving it just a little bit, but you will be\ndrinking that caffeine on an already existing backdrop\nof increased alertness for two reasons. One is adenosine is zeroed\nout, and your cortisol peak is higher. And so now when you\ningest caffeine, you can actually ingest\nlevels of caffeine that are a little\nmore reasonable that almost with certainty are\ngoing to fall in this 1 to 3 milligrams per kilogram dosage\nand will allow you to feel really alert and will\ncarry that alertness well into the afternoon hours without\nthe need to drink more caffeine and thereby will prevent\nyou from drinking caffeine and disrupting\nyour nighttime sleep. And, of course, by getting\nbetter nighttime sleep, you're going to zero out\nyour adenosine even more. So what I'm describing here\nare essentially two tools. I'm telling you to get\nmorning sunlight and maybe some exercise in\nconjunction with that even if it's brief exercise. But the main tool\nof delaying caffeine 90 to 120 minutes after\nwaking has immediate effects, but it also sets in\nmotion a cascade or domino falls that lead to better\nsleep and more wakefulness the next night and the next\nday and so on and so forth. Now I realize there are some\npeople who just simply cannot or will not delay their caffeine\n90 to 120 minutes after waking for whatever reason. First off, let me say\nthat, if you are somebody who likes to wake up and\ndo very intense exercise within the first 90\nminutes after waking, well, in that case, it would\nbe appropriate to ingest your caffeine just prior\nto doing that exercise. Not a problem. Not a problem. But you should expect that\nthe combination of drinking caffeine very shortly after\nwaking plus exercising very intensely shortly after\nwaking will increase the intensity of that early\nafternoon and afternoon fatigue that you feel. Now for some people,\nthat's a great thing. They can afford to take a nap\nor do non-sleep deep rest, step away from work, and so forth. In that case, I\nstrongly encourage you to do whatever\nit is that allows you to get regular exercise\nbecause regular exercise is going to be very beneficial. In fact, we did\nan entire episode called tool kit for fitness that\ndescribes a couple of different but really one\nmain structure that allows you to get the\nappropriate amount of resistance training and\ncardiovascular training and flexibility training\nthroughout the week. I happen to follow that\nprogram, and it works very well. And it does involve\nsome of those workouts to come very early in the\nmorning shortly after waking. And in those cases,\nI do ingest caffeine just prior to those, so within\n10, 20 minutes of waking. However, on other\ndays, I personally delay my caffeine intake\n90 to 120 minutes, and I've done that\nto great benefit. And most people, if not,\nall people that try that, have reported the same. I should mention that some\npeople will find getting out to that 90 minutes\nto be excruciatingly difficult because they're\nso accustomed to ingesting caffeine close to waking up. In that case, maybe just\npush out your caffeine intake by about 15 minutes\neach day until you hit that 90 to 120-minute mark. And that will make\nit much easier. It might take you a\nweek or so to get there. But once you get\nthere, you'll find it to be quite easy to maintain. The other thing is that,\nif you are somebody who insists on drinking caffeine\nvery shortly after waking, I would encourage you to drink\nhalf of your caffeine then and then the other half of your\ncaffeine about an hour later. That also will help offset\nsome of the afternoon crash for reasons related to the\nso-called kinetics of caffeine. Caffeine has a quarter\nlife of about 12 hours. That means that if you were\nto ingest a cup of coffee at let's say 8:00 AM-- and let's say 100\nmilligram coffee just for sake of simplicity,\nthat about 25% of that caffeine action-- we wouldn't really say 25\nmilligrams, but about 25% of that caffeine\naction will still be present at 8:00\nPM that night, which is pretty remarkable. So there's a long arc\nof caffeine effects, and this is why it\ncan impede sleep if we take caffeine in the afternoon. But again, if you're\nsomebody who wakes up and you really need\ncaffeine right away and you refuse to do this\n90 to 120-minute delay thing that I'm talking about,\nwell then, in that case, I would drink half of\nyour caffeine upon waking and then a little bit more or\nthe other half about an hour later. And that will extend the\narc of that caffeine effects such that you don't need\nit again in the afternoon because you won't experience\nthe afternoon crash. Because of the way\ncaffeine works, I should mention that,\nif you ingest caffeine on an empty stomach, it will\nhave a more potent stimulant effect. That will also tend to increase\nthe level of jitteriness that caffeine can produce. Later, I'll talk about ways\nto offset that jitteriness, but I'll just tell\nyou one tool now. Many people opt to take\n100 milligrams of theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine, as\na way to offset some of that jitteriness. Theanine will reduce\nthe jitteriness of caffeine, which is\nwhy many energy drink manufacturers and even\nsome coffee manufacturers are now putting theanine\nin energy drinks and in ground coffee\nbecause, no surprise, it allows people to consume\nmore of that beverage and thereby purchase more\nof that beverage, which is what these vendors want\nwithout feeling overly anxious and jittery. So you can take\npill form theanine if you want with your caffeine. I don't tend to do that. Rather, I control the total\ndosage of my caffeine. I do tend to consume\ncaffeine on an empty stomach because I do restrict\nmy caffeine intake to the early part of the day. And I generally eat my first\nmeal somewhere around 11:00 AM, and then I generally my last\nmeal some time around 8:00 PM or so. Those are averages. I would say plus\nor minus an hour. And that's not because\nI'm religiously following any kind of\ntime-restricted feeding. It's just that\ntends to work best with my schedule\nand my appetite. But again, that's\na general theme. There are days in which I\nwake up and I'm very hungry, and I might ingest something,\nsmall snack or something. Or if I'm meeting\nsomebody for breakfast, sometimes I'll have breakfast. Sometimes I won't. And so on and so forth. The point is that\nyou can get away with drinking less caffeine to\nget the stimulant effect if you do it on an empty stomach. And if you're somebody\nwho likes to exercise on an empty stomach-- and I'm one of those people-- well then, ingesting caffeine\njust prior to exercise can be a fantastic tool. A little bit later,\nwe'll talk about some of the physical\nperformance-enhancing effects of caffeine. But I'll just briefly\njump to a point about that as we relate to\nmorning exercise. If you are somebody who\nregularly ingests caffeine-- and we can define\nregularly by, if you've ingested caffeine every\nday for the last two weeks, you're a regular\nconsumer of caffeine. Whereas if you're somebody\nwho only ingests caffeine somewhere between two and four\ntimes per week, well then, you are not a regular\nconsumer of caffeine. You're an intermittent\nuser of caffeine. Well, if you're somebody who's\na regular user of caffeine, the performance-enhancing\neffects of caffeine are going to be most dramatic if you\ntake two or three days off from drinking caffeine,\nwhich to my mind as a-- I don't want to call\nmyself a caffeine addict but a regular caffeine user. That's a horrible notion to\nme, it is an aversive notion, because I do like the\neffects of caffeine so much. But if you really want\nto see the maximum performance-enhancing\neffects of caffeine, you will do either\none of two things. You will either\nabstain from caffeine for a few days or three days\nprior to ingesting caffeine, or you will use caffeine\non an empty stomach. It's very clear that\ncaffeine on an empty stomach enhances both the mental\nand physical enhancing effects of caffeine. And, of course, all of\nthat has to be stated on the backdrop of consideration\nthat you're very, very hungry, it can be make it\nhard to concentrate and so on and so forth. So I'm not encouraging people to\nstarve themselves by any means. Certainly, don't do that. But if you want to maximize the\nperformance-enhancing effects of caffeine, you will consume\nit on an empty stomach. And then as a final point to\nthat, caffeine is a diuretic. It causes us to lose fluid\nand, along with that fluid, to excrete sodium because\nof the effects of caffeine on various processes\nwithin the kidney. So one thing that works\nvery well to maintain mood and alertness longer given\na certain amount of caffeine intake and to avoid\nthe jitteriness and what can sometimes feel\nlike a crash or low blood sugar feeling or even blurry\nvision is to make sure that you consume at least\nan equal volume of water with your caffeine. And ideally, that\nwater would contain maybe a small pinch\nof salt or some sort of electrolyte drink-- or powder, rather. For me, I use element. Full disclosure, they are a\npodcast affiliate and sponsor. But you don't need to do that. You could simply just have\na glass of water alongside your coffee or espresso or your\nyerba mat\u00e9 and just put a small pinch of sea salt in that or\nevem just playing table salt. And that will help offset some\nof the jitteriness of caffeine. A lot of people think that,\nwhen they ingest caffeine, they get the jitteriness and\ncrash because their blood sugar is low. And while that can be the\ncase, oftentimes, it's simply because of the\nexcretion of sodium that's occurred when\nthey've ingested caffeine. So I encourage you\nto hydrate well and to hydrate with\nsomething that contains a little bit of sodium. Obviously, not so much\nthat increases hypertension or something of that sort\nbut a small amount of sodium or an electrolyte\ndrink like Element. And there are other\nelectrolyte drinks out there that can accomplish\nthe same, of course. Just a couple of\nquick notes about theanine because there are\na growing number of products out there that contain theanine. And there's certainly a growing\nnumber of people out there who are using theanine for the\neffect that I described before, which is to offset some of\nthe jitteriness associated with caffeine-containing\nbeverages or foods. And, of course, I\nshould mention that I've talked about the\neffects of theanine on sleep at that sleep\ntool kit that you can find as a free download. You don't even have\nto sign up for. Anything you just download\nit from hubermanlab.com. Go to the menu, go\nto a newsletter. You'll see the\ntool kit for sleep. You'll see that the\nso-called sleep stack that I use and recommend\nincludes magnesium 3 and 8, something called\napigenin and theanine, although that sleep\nstack is designed to be taken 30 to 60\nminutes prior to sleep. And I make the point\nthere, and I'll make it again here that\ningesting theanine prior to sleep is not a good\nidea if you are somebody who tends to have very vivid\ndreams, night terrors, or night walk-- sleepwalking, excuse\nme, et cetera. In that case, eliminate theanine\nfrom the sleep stack.. . However, a number of\npeople are using theanine, and products are using\ntheanine to offset jitteriness from caffeine-containing\nproducts during the daytime, daytime\nconsumption, that is. A couple of notes about\ntheanine-- theanine is something that is\npresent in green tea, right? It's now been created\nas a supplement. It's what's called a\nnonprotein amino acid. So while there are amino\nacids and proteins, there are, of course, amino\nacids and nonproteins. And theanine is one such\nnonprotein amino acid. Theanine tends to stimulate\nthe so-called glutamate and glutamine pathway. It's actually very similar\nto glutamate and glutamine, and it has a lot of effects\non a lot of different aspects of the nervous system. But the general\neffect of theanine is to compete for the receptors\nfor certain neurotransmitters. And the neurotransmitters\nI'm referring to are all excitatory\nneurotransmitters, things like glutamate. And they govern a tremendous\namount of our daily thinking and action and\nfeeling, et cetera, because they're present\nat so many connections between neurons in the brain. Theanine competes for the\nreceptors for glutamate and tends to reduce our\noverall levels of alertness. So really, when people\ntake theanine along with caffeine,\nwhat they're doing is they're really\ntaking a slight-- I don't want to call it\ndepressant to the point where it misleads people and\nmakes people think that it will make you depressed. The word is a little\nbit misleading. But it tends to\nreduce or blunt some of the more excitatory\npro-alertness actions of neurons in the brain. So when you take it\nalongside caffeine, tends to, quote unquote,\n\"even things out a bit.\" I should mention that\nthe dosages of theanine that are effective\nfor offsetting the jitteriness of caffeine\nis 200 to 400 milligrams, and the studies that\nI was able to find showed that essentially up\nto 900 milligrams per day can be safe. But that's a very high\ndosage of theanine. In fact, so much so\nthat it might increase sleepiness to the point\nwhere it wouldn't feel good. There are also some\npositive effects of daytime consumption\nof theanine that are independent of reducing\nthe jitteriness of caffeine. For instance, there's\na study demonstrating that 17 days of ingesting\ntheanine at these 200 to 400 milligram dosage at one\nto three times per day can reduce depression\nand anxiety. There are also some good\ndata out there showing that theanine can have positive\neffects on endothelial cells-- so blood vessels,\ncapillaries, and so on-- and increase some of the\nfunction of blood vessels, allowing them to pass\nmore blood through them and give them a little bit\nmore elasticity, if you will. So theanine has certain\npro-sleep effects if it's taken prior to sleep. It can enhance the quality,\ndepth, and duration of sleep. Again, if you're a\nsleepwalker or somebody who has extremely vivid dreams\nfrom which you wake up in the middle of the\nnight, probably best to leave out theanine or\nmaybe reduce the dosage down to 100 milligrams. And if that's still too much,\nthen eliminate it completely. But theanine can be terrific\nfor enhancing quality, depth, and duration of sleep. It can also reduce\nthe jitteriness associated with\ncaffeine-containing beverages and foods. And it has certain\nantidepressant and pro-endothelial effects. That is, it can\noffset depression. It can offset anxiety, although\nthose are minor effects, subtle effects. And it has been shown to\nimprove endothelial cell. That is, vessel and capillary\nfunction and structure in ways that can be beneficial\nfor both brain and body. Now one final point\nabout theanine that's worth paying\nattention to is that the kinetics\nof theanine are such that you don't need to take\ntheanine every time you ingest a caffeinated beverage. When we ingest caffeine,\nthe peak effects of caffeine occur about 30 minutes\nafter we drink it. And there, I'm assuming\none takes it all at once. And this is a key point that\nwe'll come back to later rather than sipping your coffee\nslowly over a couple of hours or an hour. If you drink all 200 or\n300 milligrams of caffeine in your coffee or 600\nmilligrams of your coffee if you're getting one of\nthose commercial coffees and you take theanine\nalong with it, theanine will block\nsome of the jitteriness and anxiety-inducing\neffects of caffeine that can occur for much\nlonger than the effects that caffeine lasts. So the peak in theanine occurs\nabout an hour after ingestion. I suppose if you want\nto get really fancy and really dial in\nthe kinetics, you could ingest theanine\nabout half hour before you ingest your caffeine. But I think that's getting a\nlittle bit excessive in terms of controlling your\nmicroenvironment, if you will. I think it would be perfectly\nfine to take a 100 to 200 milligram capsule of theanine\nalong with your coffee or tea or so forth and just realize\nthat if you drink more caffeine or you extend your caffeine\nintake over several hours that you don't necessarily\nhave to take theanine repeated times throughout the day. I'd like to take a\nbrief break and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform that analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA to help you better\nunderstand your body and help you reach\nyour health goals. I've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done for the simple reason that\nmany of the factors that impact your immediate and\nlong-term health can only be analyzed from\na quality blood test. The problem with a\nlot of blood and DNA tests out there, however,\nis that you get data back about metabolic factors,\nlipids, and hormones, and so forth, but you don't\nknow what to do with those data. InsideTracker\nsolves that problem and makes it very easy\nfor you to understand what sorts of nutritional,\nbehavioral, maybe even supplementation-based\ninterventions you might want to\ntake on in order to adjust the numbers of those\nmetabolic factors, hormones, lipids, and other\nthings that impact your immediate and\nlong-term health to bring those numbers into the\nranges that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you.

Let's talk for a moment\nabout when to avoid caffeine. And in the same stroke,\nlet's also talk about some of the myths around caffeine. For instance, one of the\nmajor myths around caffeine is that it can\nincrease osteoporosis. It turns out that, while there\nis a relationship, of course, between calcium\nand osteoporosis-- that is reductions\nin bone density. And it is the case that\ncaffeine can extract calcium from certain tissues. The large scale studies that\nare out there essentially prove that, if people are\ningesting enough calcium through their diet, which\nmost everybody is-- although certainly, there\nare some people that need to supplement calcium\nor make it a point to consume more calcium-containing foods. But assuming that\nyou are getting adequate levels\nof calcium, there is no direct relationship\nbetween caffeine intake and osteoporosis, at least\nnot that I'm aware of. I know this was debated\nfor a number of years in the literature,\nbut the literature seems to have arrived\nat a general consensus now that caffeine itself is not\ngoing to create or exacerbate osteoporosis, provided people\nare getting enough calcium through their diet. That is, through foods, through\nsupplementation, or both. Some of the other\nmyths around caffeine are that, for instance, caffeine\nwill reduce testosterone levels or will reduce estrogen levels. Other myths out there\nare in exact opposite to that, that caffeine will\nincrease testosterone levels, in particular, free\ntestosterone levels. There have been some large scale\nstudies addressing the hormone effects of caffeine. They are a little\nbit difficult to do. I should just\nmention that caveat. And the reason they\nare difficult to do is because 90% of adults\nare consuming caffeine. And therefore, you\ncan imagine it's very hard to find a control\ngroup to compare the caffeine consumers to. In particular, a\ncontrol group that's well controlled for other things\nlike lifestyle, diet, exercise, et cetera. However, when one controls\nas well as one can for all the various factors that\ncould impact hormones, what one discovers is that caffeine\nintake, at least at the dosages we talked about earlier, 1\ntwo 3 milligrams per kilogram of body weight or even\nup to double that, that there are no consistent\nincreases or reductions in testosterone or\nestrogen in men or women that can be directly attributed\nto the caffeine intake. And I say directly attributed\nbecause in these association studies, one always\nhas to wonder, for instance, if because people\nare ingesting more caffeine, they have more energy and\ntherefore exercising more. And exercise is\nknown to have effects on testosterone, estrogen,\nand other hormones, whether or not the effects\nof caffeine on those hormones is indirect and so\non and so forth. And this all just\nunderscores the challenges of doing studies on\nhumans in the wild in their natural habitat\nof living as opposed to an acute study as it's\ncalled to bring someone into the laboratory\nand studying them just for those hours or moments. With all that said, there does\nappear to be a relationship between caffeine intake and\nso-called sex hormone binding globulin, which is a protein\npresent in the body of both men and women that binds to\nthe sex steroid hormones-- testosterone and estrogen--\nand prevents them from being in their\nfree or active form. It has been shown that\ningestion of caffeine-- even in the sorts of dosage\nranges that are considered safe and that we've been discussing--\ncan increase sex hormone binding globulin such\nthat it can slightly reduce overall levels\nof free testosterone and free estradiol in women. Now those effects are relatively\nminor, but they do exist. If any of you are interested\nin reading further into the effects of\ncaffeine on hormones, I'll just refer you to\na couple of studies. We will link to this in\nthe show note caption. The title of the\nstudy is \"Consumption of caffeinated beverages and\nserum concentrations of sex steroid hormones in US men.\" And within this study,\nthere is a reference to a equally sized\nempowered study done on women, both of\nwhich converged on the same conclusion, by\nexamining more than a thousand. So in this case, 1,410 men or\nmore than a thousand women, that there are increases in\nsex hormone binding globulin associated with increased\nintake of coffee, in particular. But they were able to narrow\nthat down specifically to ingestion of caffeine. So it's not coffee per se that's\ncausing the increase in sex hormone binding globulin. It's actually caffeine itself. So again, the increases in\nsex hormone binding globulin were not so significant\nthat, at least to my mind, they seem like a\nconcern, although I think that it is worth noting\nthat if you're going to consume caffeine that you probably\nwant to consume caffeine in a way that is in dosages and\nwith the sort of timing that will allow you to get away\nwith ingesting caffeine but not to excess, so to\nderive the benefits of caffeine without for instance driving\nup sex hormone binding globulin too far. Now why would that\nbe a good idea? Why would you want to make\nsure that you have enough free testosterone and free estrogen? Well, some of that is\nrelated to the acute effects of those hormones in terms\nof well-being and libido and strength and mood, et\ncetera, but some of those also relates to the longer\nterm effects of sex steroid hormones. Many people don't\nrealize this, but the sex steroid hormones\noperate on the receptors at the surface of cells\nto have immediate effects. But they also can enter\ncells and actually go into the nucleus of cells\nwhere the DNA of those cells are contained and control gene\nexpression in those cells. So the sex steroid hormones,\ntestosterone and estrogen, are controlling a lot of\ndifferent cellular functions over long periods of time. So blunting their action\nover long periods of time is probably not a great idea. But again, at the\ndosages of caffeine that we're talking about\ntoday, 1 to 3 milligrams per kilogram of body\nweight, unlikely that the increases in sex\nhormone binding globulin that one experiences from that\nare going to be detrimental. And certainly, the\npositive effects of caffeine that one experiences\nin terms of mental performance and physical\nperformance and the fact that it increases energy\nto do the sorts of things like exercise that we\nknow can profoundly improve hormone\nprofiles, twofold or threefold improvement\nin hormone profiles. In that case, it seems that\ningesting caffeine is overall a good thing, provided\nit's not in excess. That also makes this\nthe appropriate time to mention one of the more\nimpressive effects of caffeine, which is on overall levels\nof mood and mental health. There are several\nstudies on this, but the one that I'm\nparticularly fond of was published in 2019\nin Psychiatry Research. And the title of the paper\nis \"Inverse association between caffeine intake\nand depressive symptoms in US adults.\" And these are data from the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. And the basic takeaway is\nthat, while, of course, there are a ton of\ndifferent factors that are going to\nrelate to whether or not people are depressed or\nnot, life circumstances, genetics, and so on, that-- and here I'm quoting\nfrom the study. \"Caffeine's psychostimulant\nproperties-- that just means\nthe ability to make us feel more alert\nand positive-- appeared to protect against\ndepressive symptoms.\" And, of course, they acknowledge\nthat additional studies are needed, but this is just one\nof several studies pointing to the fact that people who\nregularly ingest caffeine in the appropriate\ndosages do seem to enjoy an antidepressive\neffect overall. I wouldn't want anyone\nto consider caffeine a treatment for\nsevere depression or at least not\nalone a treatment for severe depression. But provided the\nanxiety-inducing effects of caffeine can be kept in\ncheck through use of theanine or making sure that the dosage\nand the timing of caffeine ingestion is correct,\nthen caffeine overall seems to be good for our\nmood and prevent depression or at least keep\ndepression at bay when depression might otherwise\nsurface or be more severe. And, of course, there are the\ndon'ts surrounding caffeine intake as it relates to sleep. And to put it very\nsimply, sleep-- that is getting\nenough quality sleep each night-- is the foundation. It is the bedrock of mental\nhealth, physical health, and performance. Sleep and the power of sleep\nfar exceeds any nootropic you could ever take,\nany prescription drug you could ever take, any\nhealth-promoting tool for your immune system,\nyour metabolism, your mental function,\nyour physical function you could ever take. Sleep is the bedrock. I know a lot of people\nexperience challenge with sleep. Nobody is perfect about sleep. That's important\nto keep in mind. I think a good goal is\nto get enough quality sleep of sufficient duration\n80% of the nights of your life and then as much as possible\nto make sure that the remaining 20% of nights you are\nnot getting enough sleep for good reasons as\nopposed to hard reasons. Good reasons would\ninclude raising children. That's important. After all, every species\ndesires to make more of itself and to preserve and extend\nthe well-being of its young, so child-rearing is a\nperfectly legitimate reason to get a lack of sleep. But you really want to strive\nto get quality sleep most nights of your life, which means that,\neven if you're somebody who can, quote unquote,\n\"drink an espresso\" and then fall right asleep,\nthat you avoid caffeine intake in the 12 hours prior to sleep. I realize not everyone\nwill be able to do that. And in fact, I\nsometimes violate that, so I tend to go to sleep\naround 10:00 PM every night, sometimes 11:00,\noccasionally 12:00 midnight, but usually around\n10:00 PM every night. I confess that my last\ningestion of caffeine is not always 10:00\nAM or prior to that, so sometimes I will\nhave caffeine up until 11:00 AM or maybe noon. And very, very rarely, I'll have\nan afternoon coffee or espresso or noncalorie-containing\nsoda or tea or something that's of that sort. But I really tried to\nrestrict my caffeine intake to the early part of my day\nthat is before noon, given that I go to sleep around\n10:00 PM each night. And I strongly encourage\neveryone out there to try and limit their\nafternoon caffeine intake. This is something that Dr.\nMatt Walker, who's an expert sleep researcher out of\nUniversity of California Berkeley Psychology and\nneuroscience department there, author of the incredible\nbook Why We sleep. He's been on this podcast,\nmany other podcasts, talking about the\nimportance of sleep. He will remind us, and\nI'll remind you now that the quarter life\nof caffeine is 12 hours. I mentioned this earlier, but\nI'm going to repeat it again. And that means that, if you\ningest caffeine at noon, 25% of its effects\nmore or less, OK? I'm using a broad stroke here\nto talk about quarter life. 25% of that is still going\nto be bioactive at midnight that night, which will disrupt\nthe early phase of your night, the amount of slow-wave\nsleep, which then in turn will disrupt the amount of rapid\neye movement sleep, which will disrupt your\nemotional processing during the following day\nand so on and so forth. None of this is\nto say that if you have the occasional cup of\ncoffee in the afternoon, that it's going to\ncompletely demolish your sleep/wake cycle forever. But I really encourage people\nto avoid drinking caffeine in the 12 hours prior to sleep. And if you can't do that, within\nthe 10 hours prior to sleep. And if you can't do that, within\nthe 8 hours prior to sleep. So really try and\nlimit your caffeine intake in the 8\nto 12 hours prior to going to sleep at night. And, of course, slow-wave\nsleep, aka deep sleep, is the sleep that's associated\nwith somewhat mundane dreams, which makes it sound like it\nmight not be that important. But it's also the sleep that's\nassociated with growth hormone release, which is important\nfor protein synthesis, repair of all bodily\ntissues and metabolism. And slow-wave sleep\nis also critically attached to your\nimmune system's ability to clear out bacteria and\nviruses that might otherwise infect your tissues. Now I'd like to talk about\ncaffeine and performance. And that includes both\nmental performance and physical performance. Now I'd like to\ntalk about caffeine and its positive\neffects on performance when used correctly. And here we are referring\nto both mental performance and physical performance. The exploration of caffeine\nas a pro-performance tool has been explored since\nthe 1930s, at least that's some of the earliest\ndocumented literature on this. Although I have\nto imagine, given that people have been\nusing caffeine for much longer than that, that long\nago somebody realized that, by ingesting a certain\nplant, that they felt much more\nalertness and were able to hunt and gather or do\nany number of different things better and, as a\nconsequence, decide to consume more of that plant. Now these days, we\nconsume a lot of caffeine in the form of coffee\nand tea mainly, and some people consume it in\nthe form of caffeine tablets or energy drinks, et cetera. Across the board, one\nfinds that caffeine intake at a level of 1 to 3 milligrams\nper kilogram of body weight improves reaction time. That is, it reduces\nthe amount of time to take a physical action or\nto answer a question correctly with a verbal response. It can also improve\ncoordination. It can also improve\nmemory, although I do want to mention that, whereas\nmost studies of the effects of caffeine on improving\nmental and physical performance involve taking caffeine at 1\nto 3 milligrams per kilogram of body weight before the\nmental task or physical task, there is also a pro-performance\neffect of caffeine on memory if one takes caffeine after\nlearning certain material or I should say being\nexposed to certain material. We'll come back to\nthat in a few minutes. If one examines reaction\ntime, mood, alertness, focus, and memory or the\nability to call up information from memory, or\nphysical dexterity, power output, endurance, and\noverall feelings of well-being during exercise and\nexertion, caffeine has been shown in numerous\nstudies in both men and women to improve all of those\nmetrics significantly. So this is all just\nto say that caffeine is an incredible\nperformance-enhancing tool. Now, what's not obvious from\nthe statement that caffeine is a performance-enhancing\ntool across the board and in men and women and\nin different contexts is that the way in\nwhich caffeine is taken is very important. Because 90% or more of\nadults consume caffeine, finding controls for studies of\ncaffeine is really challenging. That is, finding people\nwho don't ingest caffeine regularly is a very challenging\ntask for the researcher. And as a consequence,\nmany of the studies of caffeine on\nhuman beings involve depriving regular\ncaffeine users of caffeine and then examining the\neffects of caffeine given after a period of, say,\n5 to 15 days of abstinence in a person that is essentially\nexperiencing mild withdrawal symptoms because they haven't\nhad the caffeine that they were used to getting. So this is an important point. And it's a point that\nlikely exacerbates the observed pro-performance\neffects of caffeine. Now all of that isn't\nnecessarily a problem, provided you keep it in mind. And it actually points\nto a way in which even if you're a\nregular caffeine user, you can extract more of\nthe benefits of caffeine. The simplest way to\ndo this, for instance, is to look back to what we\ntalked about earlier in terms of the need to have most of your\ncortisol increase restricted to the hour or hours just\nafter waking in terms of mood and alertness and performance. One of the ways to increase\nthe peak of that cortisol early in the day is to\nconsume caffeine shortly after that peak occurs. And this was really\nnicely demonstrated in a study entitled\ncaffeine stimulation of cortisol secretion across\nthe waking hours in relation to caffeine intake levels. We will provide a\nlink to this study. It's a somewhat\ncomplicated study because they looked at a bunch\nof different times of day for caffeine intake. And I should mention,\nin this study, they use this 300 milligrams per\nday or 600 milligrams per day. So that's quite high, although\nfor people of sufficient body weight and who are accustomed\nto taking caffeine, it's certainly not\ngoing to be in excess of what a lot of people\nout there are taking. But basically, what they\nobserved was the following. Cortisol responses to\ncaffeine are reduced but not eliminated in people who consume\ncaffeine on a daily basis. What this means is\nthat, if you wake up-- as I recommended\nearlier, you avoid drinking caffeine for the first\n90 to 120 minutes after waking, but you do get some sunlight or\nother bright light in your eyes in that time, maybe\neven get some exercise in that time, which\nwould be even better-- and then you ingest caffeine,\nyou will get a further increase in cortisol, which,\nprovided it's restricted to the early part of the day,\nis a good thing overall for mood and alertness. So this is a simple\nperformance-enhancing tool, which is to stack\ncaffeine on the tail of that early cortisol peak. I should also mention,\nhowever, that, in this study, they had people do a five-day\ncaffeine abstinence prior to being tested with 300\nmilligrams or 600 milligrams of caffeine. So the simple tool to extract\nfrom this and other studies like it is that, if\nyou want to experience the maximum alertness-promoting\neffects of caffeine when you ingest it\nearly in the day, you would abstain from\ncaffeine for five days and then ingest caffeine 90\nto 120 minutes after waking. I would still hope that you\nwere doing all the other things that I described-- morning\nsunlight, exercise, et cetera-- correctly. But regardless, it's very clear\nthat a five-day abstinence from caffeine however\npainful that might be will increase the\nperformance-enhancing effects of caffeine when you take\ncaffeine on that sixth day. Now, I'm sure many of you out\nthere are saying, why would I ever want to abstain\nfrom caffeine for five days in order to just get this\nsix-day performance-enhancing effect? Well, there are a couple\nof reasons for doing that. Perhaps you're planning to\ntravel to a new time zone, and you want to use\ncaffeine as a stimulant to stay up during the\nday in the new time zone. That's a somewhat unusual case. Others of you\nmight be interested in the pro-physical performance\neffects of caffeine. We'll talk more about\nthese in a little bit. But you want to get\nthe maximum strength increase or the maximum\nendurance increase from ingesting, in this\ncase, 300 to 600 milligrams of caffeine. Well, in that case, abstaining\nfrom caffeine for five days will greatly exacerbate\nthe pro-performance effects of caffeine when you take\nit on that sixth day, although admittedly,\nthose five days are likely to be pretty painful if\nyou're a regular caffeine user. Another variation\non this, however, might be to have the\namount of caffeine that you ingest on a daily\nbasis and then go back to your regular level of\ncaffeine intake on that day in which you need the\ncaffeine to really boost your mood, energy,\nand performance. Another reason why you might\nwant to abstain from caffeine or reduce your caffeine\nintake for a period of time and then go back to your\nregular caffeine intake is simply to identify how\nmuch of an effect caffeine is really having on your overall\nlevel of daily functioning and mood. This was something\nthat was actually covered in beautiful detail\nin a book by Michael Pollan all about caffeine. It's available on Audible. I really enjoyed that book. It describes his experience\nwith the decision to completely\nabstain from caffeine for a period of months, although\nI confess that after hearing that book, what it\nbasically made me want to do is never quit drinking\ncaffeine because it sounded as if, at least my\ninterpretation was, that even after several weeks\nor months of abstaining from caffeine, that\nhe still fantasized about the effects of caffeine. But he did mention that, when\nreturning to ingesting caffeine after a period of\nlong abstinence, that it had almost a-- let's not call it a\npsychedelic property, but it had such\nobvious effects on mood and alertness and\nfeelings of well-being that it really highlighted\nfor him the extent to which caffeine normally was\nallowing him to just function what he thought was normally. So in other words,\nmany of us don't even really know what our\nnormal basal level of cognitive and\nphysical functioning is because we're\ningesting caffeine on such a regular basis. I confess that, as much\nas I enjoyed that book and as intriguing as his\ndescription of caffeine abstinence and then the\nreturn to caffeine was, I don't intend to ever\nfind out personally. Now a very good\nreason why you might want to abstain from caffeine\nfor a deliberate period of time and then return\nto caffeine intake is for its physical\nperformance-enhancing effects. And here we can look to a\nreally interesting study. The title of which\nis \"Time course of tolerance to the performance\neffects of caffeine.\" And what I like about this\nstudy is that, while yes, it does say that\nabstaining from caffeine and then returning\nto caffeine intake can enhance physical performance\nin a very specific way, it also says that, if you\ntake caffeine regularly, you can still see the physical\nperformance-enhancing effects of caffeine. Although they are not quite\nas robust as they would be had you abstained from caffeine. The design of the study\nis pretty straightforward. They had people either\ningest 3 milligrams per kilogram of caffeine\nfor 20 consecutive days. Many people are already\ndoing that, I realize, but they had people\ndo that or ensure that they were doing that. Or others ingested a\nplacebo for 20 days, so they abstained from\ncaffeine without realizing it. Then after that 20 days of\neither ingesting caffeine or a placebo, their\npeak performance was measured in terms\nof aerobic output. But prior to that measurement,\nthey had caffeine, OK? So it's 20 days of caffeine\nand then a 21st day of caffeine and then the physical\ntask on that 21st day. Or it's 20 days of\nabstinence from caffeine. And then on day 21,\nyou get caffeine, and you get the\nsame physical test. And what they discovered was\nthat the ingestion of caffeine increased peak performance\nin this aerobic output dramatically if people had\nabstained from caffeine. But for people that had consumed\ncaffeine all the way through up until that day, it still was\neffective to ingest caffeine on day 21 but not as effective\nas it would have been had they abstained. And in fact, the\nmagnitude of what they call ergogenic\neffect, which is the pro-performance-enhancing\neffect of caffeine, was higher on the first\nday than in subsequent days when they allowed people to\ncontinue caffeine intake. So the takeaway from this study\nis really straightforward. If you want to get the maximum\nphysical performance-enhancing effects of caffeine, you abstain\nfrom caffeine for 20 days. Then on day 21,\nwhen you're going to do the physical\nthing, the task, you ingest caffeine about\n30 minutes to an hour before you do that\nphysical challenge. Now 20 days of\nabstinence is going to be rough for a lot of people. I certainly don't want to\nsign up for this study. In which case, you might want\nto do five days of abstinence as we talked about before. And then on day six is the day\nthat you ingest caffeine and do the physical task. There are even some\nstudies showing that you can abstain from\ncaffeine for just two days, for just 48 hours. And, in particular, if you are\na regular user of caffeine, this allows you\nto, on day three, ingest caffeine at the dose\nthat's appropriate for you and do the physical, or I should\nmention mental performance task and perform significantly\nbetter than those that have been taking caffeine\nthroughout the entire period leading up to the challenge. So you don't necessarily\nneed to abstain for 20 days in order to get the\npro-performance effects of caffeine on day 21. You could do five days of\nabstinence prior or even two days of abstinence prior. Or if that's intolerable\nto you as it is in my mind, to me, to just reduce your\ncaffeine intake slightly or even perhaps have it\nif you can tolerate that in the week or two weeks\nor maybe even three weeks preceding some\nphysical or mental challenge. Now again, this sort of\nimplies that you're going up against a marathon,\nor you're going up against a series of long\ntests, maybe standardized tests in one day. There, I just really\nwant to point out that there is an abundant\nliterature showing that people perform best on mental tests\nif they are in the state that they were when they\nstudied for that material. Now in college, I knew\na number of people who took this to the extreme,\nthinking that if they were to study under the\neffects of alcohol, that they would be best\noff consuming alcohol prior to taking exams. And it turns out\nto not be the case. Here we're talking,\nin particular, about psychostimulant effects of\ncaffeine and other compounds. So don't think\nthat you can drink or be under the influence\nof THC and then take-- when you study and then take an\nexam under the same influence and do just as well as you would\nhad you not ingested anything. Please don't let\nthat be the takeaway. However, do let\nit be the takeaway that caffeine's\neffects are made more potent by a brief to not so\nbrief period of abstinence prior to taking a\ndosage of caffeine. And then the final\npoint to make is that, if you are somebody who\nis not accustomed to drinking caffeine, meaning you're\nhypersensitive to caffeine or you don't regularly\ningest caffeine, please do not ingest\ncaffeine on the day of any important mental\nor physical challenge or performance, because\nwhat you will find is that because you are\nnot caffeine-adapted, you will experience changes\nin your thermal regulation, in your levels of\nanxiety and jitteriness, and your levels of\nfocus that could be very detrimental to mental\nor physical performance. So you don't want to throw\nyourself in the deep end by ingesting caffeine if\nyou're not used to it. And I should mention\nthat for people that are not accustomed\nto ingesting caffeine or are very sensitive\nto caffeine. Even 25 to 50 milligrams\nof caffeine in the amount that's found in, for\ninstance, a piece of certain types of chocolate\ncan actually cause anxiety. So be careful there. Here, I'm referring only to\npeople that are accustomed with caffeine intake. So what I recommend is to\nexplore the ergogenic effects of caffeine during your training\nand then to make a decision about what you can\nreasonably and reliably do in terms of abstinence and\nthen pulse with caffeine on the day of the challenge. I get a lot of questions\nas to whether or not caffeine has different\neffects on the nervous system and on performance in\nparticular, depending on phases of the menstrual cycle. So I explored that in my\nresearch for this episode, and I found two\nstudies both of which we will reference in\nthe show note captions. The first one is entitled\n\"Caffeine consumption and menstrual function.\" So it's actually the\nrelationship between caffeine and menstrual function. We will do an entire episode\nabout the menstrual cycle and menstrual function. But the other one as it\nrelates to performance was published in 2020 in the\nEuropean Journal of Nutrition, which is \"Ergogenic\neffects of caffeine on peak aerobic cycling power\nduring the menstrual cycle.\" And the basic takeaway\nof this study is-- frankly, a very nice study,\nshowed that quote, \"Caffeine increased peak aerobic cycling\npower in the early follicular, preovulatory, and midluteal\nphases of the menstrual cycle.\" Thus, the ingestion--\nand again, here they use 3 milligrams of caffeine\nper kilogram of body mass might be considered an\nergogenic aid for women who are in the menstrual\ncycle during all three phases of their cycle. So keep that in mind, women-- for those of you that are\nregular users of caffeine or you're using caffeine to\nenhance physical performance, there does not seem to be any\nmenstrual cycle phase-dependent effects of caffeine\non performance. That is, caffeine seems\nto always increase physical performance\nregardless of the phase of the menstrual cycle\nyou might happen to be in. I'd like to touch on a little\nbit more of the use of caffeine for enhancing\nmental performance. Yes, it is the case that\ningesting 1 to 3 milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of\nbody weight in the 30 minutes or so prior to\ndoing a memory task or sitting down to\ndoing some studying or learning of any kind,\nphysical or mental performance, of any kind is beneficial\nfor all the reasons we talked about before, relate to dopamine\nand acetylcholine, et cetera. But it turns out that\nit is also the case that spiking one's adrenaline\nand other so-called catecholamines-- so this would\nbe dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine-- after\na bout of learning can greatly enhance\nmemory for the information that one was trying to learn. That's right. Spiking your adrenaline\nafter learning can greatly increase\nmemory for the material you're trying to learn. In fact, this is a practice that\ndates back centuries and was written about in a beautiful\nAnnual Review of Neuroscience on the biology of memory by\nJames McGaugh, where he talks about medieval\npractices of children being taught information and\nthen being thrown literally into cold water to stimulate\nthe release of adrenaline and that increase in adrenaline. While the mechanism wasn't\ncompletely understood, it was understood that\nthat sort of shock to the system from\nthe cold water led to better memory and\nretention of the information that these children\nhad been exposed to. And it turns out\nthe exact same thing is true for adults\nin the laboratory or kids in the laboratory. And here I'm not\nsuggesting throwing anyone into cold water. If you want to get\ninto cold water, there's a reason we\ncall it deliberate cold exposure on the\npodcast is that it should be deliberate and\ncontrolled by you, not by somebody else. And if it's controlled\nby somebody else, that might be military\nscreening or something. But here we're talking about\ndeliberately increasing your levels of adrenaline and\nother catecholamines, dopamine, norepinephrine, et cetera. You can do that certainly\nby deliberate cold exposure with a cold shower or\ngetting in up to your neck in cold water of any kind. But the other way to do that\nis to spike your adrenaline by ingesting 1 to 3 milligrams\nper kilogram of caffeine after sitting down to try and\nlearn some material I confess that, more often than not, I\nuse caffeine in the same way that most people\nuse it, which is OK. I'm going to sit down. I'm going to research\ninformation for a podcast or assemble some information\nfor a paper or grant, and I want to focus. So I will drink a cup of\ncoffee at the beginning of that and maybe even throughout\nthat or a couple of yerba mat\u00e9 at the beginning\nor throughout that. Or I'll sip on one or both\nthroughout trying to learn. And that works\nquite well in terms of maintaining focus and\nalertness and retention of information, but\nit is indeed the case. That is, the research\nsupports the fact. And I've experienced\nthe fact that, if I abstain from caffeine while\nI'm trying to learn something-- but then I drink caffeine\nimmediately after. Somewhat surprisingly to me\nbut certainly in a way that's consistent with the\nresearch literature, memory for the information that I was\nfocused on prior to ingesting that caffeine is much greater. And here I'm talking about\nas a personal anecdote, but this is actually what the\ndata point to both in animals and in humans. And if you think about\nit, it makes perfect sense because the way that the\nmemory systems of the brain are organized is that we go\nthrough life experiencing things. We encounter surprises\nboth good and bad. We go through the motions of\nthings both typical, mundane, exciting, and novel,\nand not novel. And then every once\nin a while, something will happen that will\nspike our catecholamines. Dopamine, typically if\nit's a positive surprise. Adrenaline, which\ncan be associated with both positive\nsurprise or positive events and negative events\nor surprises. And without fail, increases\nin the catecholamines tend to lock in\nmemories for things that preceded the increase\nin those catecholamines. Again, the catecholamines\nbeing dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, sometimes\nall three in combination, sometimes just two of those,\nsometimes just one of those, depending on the experience. So it makes perfect\nsense that using caffeine at the end of a\nlearning bout would enhance our memory\nfor the information that we are trying to learn. So if you decide that you\nwant to try and extract this performance-enhancing\neffect of caffeine, what I recommend would be to try and\nabstain from caffeine for a day or two prior. But if you can't,\nyou just continue with your normal\ncaffeine intake. But then when you sit down\nto study or learn something to not ingest any caffeine as\nyou do that but then afterward to ingest caffeine. Now in theory, you could\nprobably further enhance the memory encoding\neffects of adrenaline and the other catecholamines\nby drinking caffeine and then taking a cold shower or\ndoing deliberate cold exposure if you really wanted to\nor had the ability to or doing some sort of\nintense form of exercise. And we'll talk in\na moment about how caffeine, exercise, and the\nadrenaline system interact. But as a brief but\nrelevant to side, brief bouts of intense exercise\nranging from 10 to 50 minutes or so have been shown to\nimprove memory for information that one was trying to learn\nprior to the intense exercise. This is work from Dr.\nWendy Suzuki's lab at NYU as well as other\nlaboratories, some of the work that's being done at Stanford\nin the Mind, Body Laboratories. And our laboratory points in\nthe direction of these kinds of effects as well. They all come back to the\nsame general neurochemical theme, which is that,\nwhen we experience an increase in these\ncatecholamines that include adrenaline, dopamine,\nand norepinephrine, the memory systems of the\nbrain flip on in a way that try to capture the information\nand the perceptions and the experiences that we\nwere exposed to just prior to the increase in\ncatecholamines and caffeine but also exercise\nand also cold water. And, of course, any of those\nalone or in combination all increase the levels\nof catecholamines, so it makes perfect\nlogical mechanistic sense as to why this would work. And in fact, it does work. If you want to remember\nspecific information, you might consider using\ncaffeine as you move through and absorb and are exposed\nto that information. But you might also\nconsider using caffeine after being exposed\nto that information because studies in\nanimals and humans show that that is a potent way\nto increase memory for what you are just exposed to. I should mention that\nwhat I just described also pushes back on something that\nI know a number of people perhaps have heard about\nand maybe even use, which is this notion of the nappuccino. I remember hearing about\nthis a few years back. It was sort of\ntrend, if you will. The trend involved\ndrinking a cup of coffee or a double espresso and then\ngoing down for a nap typically in the afternoon\nand then waking up. And the idea was that the\ncaffeine would hit your system right at the time that\nyou awake from the nap and that you would be better\nable to focus and exercise. There are a couple of things\nabout that practice that I don't like. First of all, it\nimplies, in most cases, that you're napping\nand ingesting caffeine in the afternoon, which\nI realize for many students and for people that are\ncomfortable staying up until the wee hours of the\nnight and then waking up late the next day might be\ncompatible with their schedule. But again, because of the\nsleep-diminishing effects of caffeine-- and we talked about earlier. I'm not crazy about\nthe idea of people ingesting caffeine\nin the late afternoon in order to perform better\nin the late afternoon. Far better would be to\nrestrict caffeine intake to the early part of the day\nas we talked about earlier. The other reason\nis that the data on things like\nnon-sleep deep rest and naps in the afternoon--\nand again, the rule here is that you don't have to nap. But if you want\nto nap, it's been shown that naps of\n90 minutes or less or non-sleep deep rest\nprotocols-- and you can find those-- for instance,\nthere's one with me speaking. You just put NSDR\nHuberman into YouTube. You can hear that. It's completely zero cost. There are other NSDR\nscripts out there now, of course, if you prefer\nthose, that those can all lead to increases in one\nof the catecholamines at least, which is dopamine. That's been shown in a really\nnice neurotransmitter labeling study, not from my laboratory,\nbut from another laboratory, but also can improve mood,\nfocus, and alertness on its own without the need to\ningest caffeine prior to going into those states. And in fact, ingesting\ncaffeine prior to a nap or ingesting caffeine\nprior to NSDR is most certainly going to\nreduce the effectiveness of that nap and\nNSDR in restoring natural levels of\nalertness and focus that would lead to the\nperformance-enhancing effect. So I'm not such a fan of\nthe so-called nappuccino, although if any of you\nout there have derived great benefit from\nit, definitely let me know your protocol\nand what you've experienced. Put it in the comment\nsection if you would. I'd appreciate that. There's another very important\nand potent use of caffeine for enhancing performance. And this relates not just to\nthe dopamine and epinephrine and the arousal-inducing\neffects of caffeine. And it doesn't even just relate\nto the effect of caffeine on enhancing frontal\nlobe function. It does include all\nthat, but it also includes those reinforcing\neffects of caffeine that we talked about at the\nbeginning of the episode. And the best way to illustrate\nthese performance-enhancing effects of caffeine\nthat stem directly from its association\nwith reinforcement is to highlight a study. And the title of the study\nis \"Blood dopamine level enhanced by caffeine in men\nafter treadmill running.\" And as the title suggests,\nthis was carried out in men, but there's no reason to think\nthat the same results wouldn't also be present in women. There are some sex-dependent\neffects of caffeine. I'll touch on just\nbriefly at the end. But those are largely\npresent in kids. That is, adolescents and\nteens as opposed to adults. So this study is\nreally interesting. What they had people do was\nrun on a treadmill and either ingest caffeine-- again, 3\nmilligrams per kilogram of body weight-- or to not ingest caffeine. And then they looked\nat levels of dopamine and other neurotransmitters\nand hormones, such as prolactin and cortisol. And the basic takeaway\nis, as the title suggests, that exercise, while on its\nown, can increase cortisol in healthy ways, provided it's\nnot too intense and too long. A little note here, if you\nhave trouble recovering from exercise or\nyou want to continue to derive the benefits from\nexercise, in general, best not to do high-intensity exercise\nfor longer than 75 minutes. Or 90 minutes probably\nbeing the outer threshold. I realized that there are\nsome genetic freaks out there or people that are\nchemically assisted that can recover from very\nintense long bouts of exercise. But most people don't do\nwell through long bouts of intense exercise\non a regular basis. And limiting their\nintense exercise to 60 minutes or less-- that doesn't include\nthe warm-up-- is going to be beneficial. See the episode on\ntool kit for fitness if you'd like details on that. Exercise is known to increase\nlevels of dopamine, cortisol, and other catecholamines and\nneurotransmitters very potently and things like\ntestosterone and estrogen in ways that we know\nare beneficial to us and, of course, have all\nthese positive effects on the musculoskeletal system\nand cardiovascular effects. But unbeknownst to most\npeople, ingesting 3 milligrams per kilogram of caffeine\nprior to exercise further increases the dopamine release\nassociated with exercise specifically. And this has two\nimportant effects. First of all, that\nincrease in dopamine is great because it provides\na long-lasting increase in focus alertness\nand motivation, not just during the exercise,\nbut also after the exercise. And second, it-- that\nis, caffeine and dopamine in combination--\nact as a reinforcer to make the experience of\nexercise and the period immediate after exercise\nmore pleasant and, in fact, reinforcing. So in other words, one\nway to enjoy exercise more and to enjoy the activities\nthat follow exercise more and to experience a genuine\nincrease in dopamine that's beneficial for\nmood and alertness is to ingest caffeine\nprior to exercise. Now this is important because\na number of people out there are exercising, love\nexercise, love eating great, love doing all the\nthings that are beneficial for their health,\nbut a number of people out there really don't like to exercise. And that serves as a serious\nblock for their willingness and their consistency\nto exercise. Ingesting caffeine gives\nus energy to exercise. It increases the release of\nneurochemicals and hormones that are good for\nus during exercise. But as I'm highlighting\nhere, it also increases the\nreinforcement pathways associated with exercise. That is, it creates\na positive feeling about the general theme\nof engaging in exercise, and it creates a general\npositive experience of the things that\nfollow exercise. So I think this, if nothing\nelse is a call for or support for the idea, that\ningesting caffeine as a performance-enhancing\ntool makes perfect sense. But for those out there\nthat don't enjoy exercise, in particular, certain\nforms of exercise, ingesting caffeine can\nchange your relationship to that exercise. In other words, make it more\npositive, much in the same way that ingesting caffeine\nalongside a certain taste that would otherwise be neutral\nor maybe even negative can actually make the taste of\nthat particular drink or food positive. So again, this brings us back\nto the reinforcing properties of caffeine that\nare subconscious. It's not just about the\nenhanced performance in the test or the enhanced performance\non the treadmill or with the weights in the gym. It's enhanced feelings\nof mood and well-being that are genuine because\nof the effect of caffeine on certain neurotransmitter\nand hormone systems, but it also is creating\nan overall milieu of reinforcing all\nof the things that led in to occur during\nand occur after exercise. I do want to point out something\nthat's very important as it relates to combining\nthings like caffeine and exercise in order\nto increase dopamine. This is something that\ncame up in the episode that I did on dopamine,\nmotivation, and drive, which turns out to be one of\nour most popular episodes. Again, you can find that at\nhubermanlab.com and links to all formats with\ntime stamps, et cetera. This also came up in\nthe episode on ADHD because of the relationship\nbetween ADHD and dopamine. And that's this notion\nof dopamine stacking. In the episode on dopamine,\nmotivation, and drive, I pointed out that, while there\nare a near-infinite number of things that can\nincrease dopamine release, most notably positive surprise\nor positive anticipation or experiencing a win. Certainly, there are compounds,\nboth drugs of abuse, food, sex, and certain supplements\nthat can increase dopamine to varying levels and\nto varying degrees, both healthy and unhealthy. That's all contained in\nthat episode on dopamine, motivation, and drive. But what I pointed\nout is that, if you are somebody who tends\nto experience difficulty with motivation-- that\nso-called dopamine stacking as I called\nit might be something that you want to avoid. What's dopamine stacking? Dopamine stacking\nwould be combining a highly caffeinated energy\ndrink that also includes the amino acid tyrosine, which\nis a precursor to dopamine, plus loud music plus getting\nyourself really ramped up then an intense workout. All of that can be great if you\ndo it every once in a while. But what you will quickly find\nis that the extent to which your dopamine\npeaks also dictates the extent to which\nyour dopamine will drop after that peak. And when I say drop, I\nmean drop below baseline. So a lot of people find that,\nif they stack a lot of things to peak their dopamine,\nthen they experience a low, and it does take some time for\nthem to return to baseline. And I highly recommend\nnot engaging in activities or consuming compounds that\nare in attempt to accelerate that return to baseline\nbecause all it will do is drive that baseline\nlower and lower. So this requires\nbeing able to tolerate a drop in dopamine baseline for\na period of time, et cetera. Now the reason I'm\nbringing this up now in the context of\nthis caffeine episode is I just described a study\nin which using caffeine prior to exercise increases\ndopamine after exercise. And so you might be\nsaying, especially if you heard that earlier\nepisode, wait, isn't that dopamine stacking? Aren't you encouraging\nme to stack my dopamine? Well, in some sense, yes. But keep in mind,\nI'm not suggesting that you do this every\ntime you exercise. So just as in that\nearlier episode, I emphasized the fact\nthat, while stacking multiple stimuli-- caffeine or energy drinks\nand music and et cetera-- for exercise or for mental\nwork or for any experience for that matter is OK to do\nevery once in a while for most people, you don't want to\nget in the habit of doing it consistently every\ntime you exercise or every time you go\nout, for instance. And so you really\nwant to be cautious. That is, you want to\nprotect your both baseline levels of dopamine and your\npeak levels of dopamine. That said, for people\nthat want to experience an increase in mood,\nalertness, and performance, or who want to\ncondition themselves-- because that's\nreally what it is. It's conditioning yourself\nby the reinforcing effects of dopamine to increase\nyour liking or maybe even your loving of exercise. Occasionally, using\ncaffeine or frequently using caffeine prior to exercise\nis fine but be very careful. And by being very\ncareful, what I mean is pay attention to how you\nfeel in the hours and days after that dopamine\nincrease wears off. So for instance, if you ingest\ncaffeine and then exercise very intensely and you're\nfeeling great afterwards but then eight hours\nlater or the next day, you're feeling a\nlittle bit low, I suggest you don't go back and\ndo the exact same thing right away. I would give yourself\na little bit of time to let that baseline of\ndopamine return to normal. So again, stacking\ndifferent things, chemical and behavioral, in\norder to increase dopamine can be done in a safe way\nthat's beneficial to you, depending on your goals. But be careful about not\nstacking too many stimuli for dopamine too often. That's the key. Early in the\nepisode, I mentioned one possible\ncaffeine-consuming schedule that works very well that\ndoesn't fortunately subject you to long 20-day bouts or 5-day or\neven 2-day bouts of abstinence. And that's the every other\nday schedule of caffeine. If you look at the\nhalf-life of caffeine and you look at its effects\non the dopamine system and its\nperformance-enhancing effects and how a period of abstinence\ncan, in fact, increase the performance-enhancing\neffects of caffeine-- but also take into\nconsideration that caffeine can be habit-forming, and we\ncan develop a sort of tolerance to caffeine. Well then, what emerges\nfrom all of that is that being a person\nwho consumes caffeine every other day\ncan actually help you maximize most of the\npositive effects of caffeine without subjecting you to the\nkind of misery that occurs if you're accustomed\nto consuming caffeine every single day and\nthen suddenly go into a 2 or 5 or 20-day abstinence. So I myself have never tried\nan every other day caffeine approach, although\nI'm considering doing it based on the\nliterature that I've read. And I'm considering doing it\nin a very specific way, which would be to only consume\ncaffeine on the days in which I resistance train. And since I tend to do that\nabout three or four days per week organized in a way\nthat's every other day-- again, if you want to see the exercise\nschedule that I follow, including cardiovascular\nexercise and weight training and all the reasons\nand rationale for what I do and how it maps on to the\nscientific literature, relate to health span and\nlifespan, vitality, et cetera, you can find that\nat hubermanlab.com. And we had a tool\nkit for fitness that ought to be posted to\nour website before long. The every-other-day schedule\nof caffeine intake, to me, seems like the most\nrational one if one wants to maximize on the\nperformance-enhancing effects of caffeine without suffering\nthe effects of caffeine withdrawal that are\nassociated with being a regular consumer of\ncaffeine and then stopping caffeine intake, such as\nheadache and irritability and so forth. Not I nor anyone\nin my life wants me to experience\nthose effects, and I'm sure you don't\nwant to experience those effects for you either. So if you're\nsomebody that decides to try the every\nother day protocol or you are somebody who's\nalready doing that protocol, please let me know what your\nexperiences with that are. At least by my read of\nthe literature on caffeine and it's\nperformance-enhancing effects but also the effects of caffeine\non neurotransmitter and hormone systems, the every-other-day\ncaffeine schedule does seem to be the most\nrational and scientifically grounded one in order to\nmaximize on all those effects. In addition to so-called\nperformance-enhancing effects of caffeine, there are also\nthe well studied and now fairly well mechanistically understood\npro-health effects of caffeine. Now, here when I talk about\npro-health effects of caffeine, I want to be very clear that,\nif your schedule of caffeine intake-- that is, your timing\nof caffeine intake or anything else\nfor that matter-- offsets getting regular\nhigh quality sleep of sufficient duration,\nwell, then you are undermining the pro-health\neffects of that thing. This is true for exercise. This is true for caffeine. This is true for\nsupplementation. This is true for\nprescription drugs. Again, you don't want to\nbe neurotically attached to the idea that you have to\nget perfect sleep every night because that's simply not\ntrue but is absolutely the case that anything, whether\nor not it's good for you or bad for you in the short\nterm, that disrupts your sleep because of the timing in which\nyou're doing that thing is going to undermine your\nimmediate and long-term health before long. So with that said,\nthere are several well described health-promoting\neffects of caffeine ingestion. And once again, when I\nsay caffeine ingestion, I'm referring to that 1 to\n3 milligrams per kilogram of body weight dosage. There are really nice studies\nshowing that being a regular consumer of caffeine can help\noffset some of the probability, some of the probability\nof developing Parkinson's and maybe\nAlzheimer's-related dementia as well. These are not terribly\ncontroversial data because of the\nfact that caffeine is known to increase the\nrelease of those catecholamines, dopamine, epinephrine, and\nnorepinephrine, as well as acetylcholine. All those neurotransmitter\nand neuromodulator systems are the ones that are\nknown to be defective in Parkinson's and\nAlzheimer's, although there are other transmitter\nand hormone systems that are defective as well. There are beautiful reviews\non the neuroprotective effects of caffeine and\nneurodegenerative diseases. They're quite extensive. And I'll just refer you to one\nand the references therein, and we'll provide a link to\nthis in the show note caption. So the title as the\ntopic at hand suggests is the neuroprotective\neffects of caffeine and neurodegenerative diseases. This was published in 2016. I'm sure there have been\nother reviews since then, but it includes many, many\nquality references and studies, both in animals and in\nhumans, pointing to the fact that specific enzymes\nthat are associated with the health of, in\nparticular, dopamine neurons are made more robust by\nregular ingestion of caffeine. It also points to the\nfact that the increase in dopamine receptors\nthat is induced by regular ingestion of caffeine\nthat I referred to earlier is another way in which\ndopamine, however many dopamine neurons remain around in people\nwith Parkinson's or people who are aging that lose\ndopamine neurons naturally, that dopamine can have\nits maximal effect because of the increase in receptors for\ndopamine that caffeine induces. And there are other\nbiological mechanisms that further\nsupport why caffeine ought to be\nneuroprotective, including its effects on the\nacetylcholine system, which is one of the major\nsystems disrupted in Alzheimer's dementia. So in other words, it\nmakes perfect sense as to why caffeine would\nbe neuroprotective. Caffeine has also been\nshown to diminish headache, particularly when taken in\ncombination with aspirin. And that's because of the\neffects of caffeine and aspirin on blood flow. There's also evidence\nthat caffeine can provide brief but\nsubstantial relief from asthma. So I wouldn't want people\nto rely on caffeine as a lifesaving approach\nto an asthmatic attack. That said, for people that\nsuffer from minor asthma, that caffeine intake-- again, of the dosages\nthat we talked about before has been\nshown to alleviate some of the major symptoms\nof asthma for anywhere from one to four hours. And I know this is of relevance\nto a lot of people out there. Because caffeine increases\nthe catecholamines and in particular because\ncaffeine increases dopamine transmission in\nthe prefrontal cortex-- this area of the brain that's\nassociated with focus and rule setting and context\nand task switching-- caffeine is known to\nimprove focus and alertness, in particular, in\npeople who have symptoms of ADHD or other\nattention and focus issues. Now caffeine alone\ndoes not appear to be as potent for\nthe treatment of ADHD as are things like Ritalin,\nAdderall, modafinil, or modafinil and Vyvanse. If you would like a sort\nof head by head comparison of prescription\ndrugs, supplements, and things like\ncaffeine as well as coverage of behavioral tools\nand nutritional tools, et cetera that can positively offset\nsome of the symptoms of ADHD, please see the episode\nthat I did on ADHD. Again, that's available at\nhubermanlab.com in all formats. But that said, caffeine\ndoes increase focus, and it does it through a\nnumber of different mechanisms, not the least of which is to\nincrease dopamine transmission in the forebrain just as a drug\nlike Ritalin or Adderall would, although not to the same\nextent as a drug like Ritalin or Adderall does. Before we close today, I do\nwant to just briefly return to the reinforcing\neffects of caffeine that we talked about earlier. This study on the\nhoneybees that showed that bees prefer certain vectors\nbecause they contain caffeine. Even though they are not aware\nthat those vectors contain caffeine, they just come to like\nthe feeling that those nectars provide them so much\nthat they associate that in a subconscious way with\nthe flowers themselves, and they come to\nlike those flowers. Or human beings. For instance, children that\ningest caffeinated beverages come to adore the taste\nof those beverages. And beautiful studies have been\ndone that describe how children and adults truly cannot\ndistinguish between the taste of a caffeinated and\nnoncaffeinated beverage. And caffeine can be placed\ninto essentially any beverage in order to give us a preference\nfor that beverage or food. In fact, the studies have\nbeen done with yogurt. If you put caffeine into\nyogurt of different flavors-- even plain yogurt which\nmost kids don't like-- they will come to prefer\nwhatever flavor contain the caffeine even\nif then you remove the caffeine from that flavor. Now eventually, their\npreference for that flavor will be extinguished,\nbut all of this is just to say that so many\nof the things that we like, whether or not it's coffee or\ntea or a given flavor of food or a given experience\nor even exercise, occur because we ingest\ncaffeine in conjunction with those activities. Now these are not tricks\nthat your nervous system plays on you. These are real\nneurochemical-reinforcing effects. And I think that we\nwould all do well to think about and to leverage\nthese reinforcing effects much in the same\nway we would do well to think about and hopefully\nnot leverage aversive effects of certain compounds, right? The simple way to put\nthis is I or anyone could get you to dislike\nsomething, someone, or some place by making you feel\nslightly less good, lower mood. I don't even have to make you\nfeel nauseous but less good after ingesting\nsomething or having a certain kind of interaction or\nbeing in a certain environment, very straightforward to do\nthat, because of the way that your nervous system\nis wired for conditioning. However, there's the\npositive side of all this, which is that it's very\nstraightforward to reinforce the experience of a given\nfood, including its taste, but all the context around it,\nthe container, the texture, the people you consume it\nwith, where you consume it, et cetera. For instance, I\nwonder why we are not pairing caffeine with broccoli. And here I'm not suggesting\nthat people actually do that experiment or\nplay that trick on people, but you have to sort of\nimagine that, if caffeine is this incredible reinforcer\nof all sorts of things, in particular, things that we\ningest and would want to ingest more of if it's paired\nwith caffeine, well then, you actually can use\ncaffeine as a tool to increase reinforcement\nof different things. And you can avoid caffeine as a\nway to further reinforce things that you would like to stop. And here I'd like to just give\nthe example of sugar cravings. A lot of people ask me, how\ndo I avoid sugar cravings? I've talked about the use\nof L-glutamine for that. I've talked about\nmaking sure you're getting enough essential fatty\nacids and essential amino acids as a way to reduce\nsugar cravings. Please note,\nhowever, that if you are somebody who likes to have\nyour sugar, whether or not it's a piece of chocolate\nor your dessert, et cetera-- I'm not saying that's\nbad, but if you're trying to reduce your sugar\ncravings, ask yourself, are you ingesting sugar\nalong with caffeine? Could be the caffeine contained\nin that sugar-containing food like chocolate. Or it could be\nthat you're having a cup of coffee along\nwith your pastry, and then you're struggling\nwith sugar cravings. Well, think about it. You're not just being reinforced\nby the sugar and the effects of sugar on dopamine\nwhich are real and both conscious\nand subconscious through the gut to the\nbrain dopamine system and direct on the\nbrain dopamine system. But by coingesting\ncaffeine, you are also further enhancing the\nreinforcing effects of sugar. The flip side to all of this\nis that you could use caffeine as a way to increase your\nappetite for certain things. I actually know somebody. I won't reveal who\nthis person is, but they are quite\nprominent podcaster who ingests 125 to 150\nmilligrams of in tablet form along with herbal\ntea and use this as a way to develop a\npreference for herbal tea because they found that\ncoffee was giving them other effects that\nweren't good for them. So it works quite\nwell in animals, and it works quite\nwell in insects. And it works quite\nwell in humans. I suppose animals,\ninsects, and humans are all animals at the end of\nthe day, so no surprise there. But it all underscores the\nextent to which caffeine is an absolutely\nfascinating molecule. I mean, its ability to\noffset the sleepiness system, if you will, this\nadenosine system, and to control our\nschedules in that way to essentially take a\nwithdrawal against the bank that is adenosine and\nthen pay that back later in the form of\ngetting sleepy later as opposed to when we\nwant to be alert, its ability to enhance\nfocus, alertness, and mood. And if taken after trying to\nlearn something and remember it, to enhance\nmemory, especially. And its ability to increase\nVO2 max, increased strength. We didn't even talk\ntoday about it, but I'll just briefly\nmention that caffeine ingested in the sorts of\ndoses we talked about earlier. Because its effects on\nthe neuromuscular system and the calcium system\nassociated with neuromuscular exertion and fatigue can\nincrease peak power output and muscle contractability. It's enhancing\nperformance there as well. And, of course, caffeine\ndoes a number of other things just generally related to\noverall and basal level of mood and alertness, not\nthe least of which are these increases in dopamine. So caffeine is really\nan incredible molecule. It's affecting all these\nvarious neurotransmitter systems but not haphazardly. It's increasing dopamine and\nacetylcholine in the forebrain to increase attention. It's reducing fatigue. It's improving mental\nand physical performance for some obvious and some\nnot so obvious reasons. And what I think is among the\nmore miraculous and powerful effects of caffeine, it is\na potent, potent, potent reinforcer of things, foods,\npeople, and experiences. And it's one that you can\nleverage in any direction that you like once\nyou understand the way that caffeine exerts\nthose reinforcing properties. So today, I've really tried\nto cover as much as I could about the mechanisms of caffeine\naction in the brain and body, as well as tools and\nschedules and dosages in which you can leverage\ncaffeine in order to meet your\nphysical performance, mental performance, and\nfrankly mental health, and overall health goals.
