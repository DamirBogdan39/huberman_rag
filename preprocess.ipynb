       "[Document(page_content=\"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\n\\nwhere we discuss science\\n\\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\\n\\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\\n\\nand I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology\\n\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\n\\nToday, we are discussing headaches.\\n\\nHeadaches are something that everybody will suffer\\n\\nat some point in their lifetime.\\n\\nOf course, some people suffer from headaches\\n\\nfar more often than others.\\n\\nAnd for many people, headaches can be incredibly debilitating,\\n\\nlimiting their ability to work, to socialize,\\n\\nto sleep, to exercise,\\n\\nessentially to live life in any kind of normal way.\\n\\nAs we'll soon discuss,\\n\\nthere are many different kinds of headache.\\n\\nWe have migraine headaches,\\n\\ntension headaches, cluster headaches.\\n\\nToday, we'll review all the different types of headaches\\n\\nand what the underlying biology\\n\\nof each and every one of those types of headaches is,\\n\\nas well as, fortunately,\\n\\nthe many excellent treatments that exist\\n\\nfor the different types of headache.\\n\\nIn fact, what we'll soon discuss\\n\\nis that by understanding which type of headache you have\\n\\nand a little bit about the underlying biology\\n\\nof each different type of headache,\\n\\nit becomes quite straightforward\\n\\nto select the best treatment options for you\\n\\nto, for instance, provide relief\\n\\nfrom frequent and recurring tension headaches,\\n\\ncluster headaches, even sinus headaches,\\n\\nthe sorts of headaches that are associated\\n\\nwith sinus infections and colds\\n\\nwhere the sinuses get clogged up\\n\\nand you experience headache.\\n\\nSo while today's episode focuses on all aspects\\n\\nand types of headaches,\\n\\nit will have tremendous relevance for everybody.\\n\\nSo for those of you that experience headache\\n\\nevery once in a while,\\n\\nor only when you're sick or have a sinus headache,\\n\\nor for those of you that suffer from debilitating migraines,\\n\\ntoday's conversation actually has a bit of optimism\\n\\nwoven into it, meaning there are excellent treatments\\n\\nfor each and every one of the different types of headaches.\\n\\nAnd I was quite impressed and excited to learn\\n\\nwhen researching this episode\\n\\nthat the treatments for headache range from, of course,\\n\\nprescription drug treatments\\n\\nand over-the-counter medications\\n\\nof the sort of type that most of us have heard about,\\n\\nibuprofen, acetaminophen, and so forth,\\n\\nso-called anti-inflammatory drugs.\\n\\nBut it turns out there are many natural treatments\\n\\nfor headaches that when compared\\n\\nto those over-the-counter drugs\\n\\nand even some prescription drugs,\\n\\nappear to be easily as effective\\n\\nand in many cases more effective\\n\\nthan the typical drug treatments,\\n\\nmany of which can carry side effects.\\n\\nThat is, the drug treatments carry side effects,\\n\\nwhereas the natural treatments\\n\\nappear to not carry side effects.\\n\\nNow, of course, anytime we have a discussion\\n\\nabout natural treatments,\\n\\nthere are likely to be some eye rolls out there\\n\\nand people thinking, oh, you know,\\n\\nthis is going to be a bunch of woo science.\\n\\nWell, far from it.\\n\\nAs you'll soon learn today,\\n\\neach and every one of the treatments\\n\\nfor each and every one of the different kinds of headaches\\n\\nis grounded in solid biological understanding\\n\\nof why that particular treatment ought to work\\n\\nand does work.\\n\\nSo for instance, you'll learn that some headache arises\\n\\nbecause of muscular pain,\\n\\nother headache arises because of excessive vasodilation.\\n\\nThe arteries and blood vessels get bigger and wider\\n\\nand so there's a pressure and a swelling within the cranium\\n\\nthat people experience as a headache.\\n\\nAnd it turns out that many\\n\\nof the more natural treatments out there\\n\\ncan address either the muscular pain issue\\n\\nor the vasodilation issue\\n\\nor other issues and underlying mechanisms for headache.\\n\\nSo again, while headaches are very intrusive,\\n\\nirritating and in some cases debilitating,\\n\\nthere is certainly light at the end of this tunnel.\\n\\nMeaning by the end of today's episode,\\n\\neach and every one of you will have an array\\n\\nof excellent treatment options that you can choose from\\n\\nin order to address and provide relief\\n\\nfrom any of the different types of headache.\\n\\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\\n\\nthat this podcast is separate\\n\\nfrom my teaching and research roles at Stanford.\\n\\nIt is however, part of my desire and effort\\n\\nto bring zero cost to consumer information about science\\n\\nand science related tools to the general public.\\n\\nIn keeping with that theme,\\n\\nI'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.\\n\\nOur first sponsor is Thesis.\\n\\nThesis makes custom nootropics.\\n\\nAnd as many of you know,\\n\\nI'm not a fan of the word nootropics\\n\\nbecause nootropics means smart drugs.\\n\\nAnd as a neuroscientist, I can tell you,\\n\\nthere is no neural circuit in the brain for being smart.\\n\\nThesis understands this\\n\\nand has designed different nootropics\\n\\nin order to bring your brain into specific states\\n\\nfor specific types of work.\\n\\nSo for instance, for creative work\\n\\nor to engage with more focus\\n\\nor to give you more energy for cognitive or physical work.\\n\\nSo with Thesis, they'll design custom nootropics for you\\n\\nthat will allow you more focus, better task switching,\\n\\nmore creativity and so on.\\n\\nAnd they'll be sure to include only the ingredients\\n\\nthat you want and not the ingredients that you don't.\\n\\nI've been using Thesis for more than a year now\\n\\nand I can confidently say\\n\\nthat their nootropics have been a total game changer for me.\\n\\nI like the clarity formula prior to long bouts\\n\\nof cognitive work or the energy formula\\n\\nprior to physical workouts.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try\\n\\nyour own personalized nootropic starter kit,\\n\\ngo online to takethesis.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nYou'll take a brief three minute quiz\\n\\nand Thesis will send you four different formulas\\n\\nto try in your first month.\\n\\nAgain, that's takethesis.com slash Huberman\\n\\nand use the code Huberman at checkout\\n\\nfor 10% off your first box.\\n\\nToday's episode is also brought to us by Element.\\n\\nElement is an electrolyte drink\\n\\nthat has everything you need and nothing you don't.\\n\\nThat means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element\\n\\nand those are sodium, magnesium and potassium,\\n\\nbut it has no sugar.\\n\\nI've talked many times before on this podcast\\n\\nabout the key role of hydration and electrolytes\\n\\nfor nerve cell function, neuron function,\\n\\nas well as the function of all the cells\\n\\nand all the tissues and organ systems of the body.\\n\\nIf we have sodium, magnesium and potassium\\n\\npresent in the proper ratios,\\n\\nall of those cells function properly\\n\\nand all our bodily systems can be optimized.\\n\\nIf the electrolytes are not present\\n\\nand if hydration is low,\\n\\nwe simply can't think as well as we would otherwise.\\n\\nOur mood is off, hormone systems go off,\\n\\nour ability to get into physical action,\\n\\nto engage in endurance and strength\\n\\nand all sorts of other things is diminished.\\n\\nSo with Element, you can make sure\\n\\nthat you're staying on top of your hydration\\n\\nand that you're getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try Element,\\n\\nyou can go to drinkelement, that's lmnt.com slash Huberman\\n\\nand you'll get a free Element sample pack\\n\\nwith your purchase.\\n\\nThey're all delicious.\\n\\nSo again, if you want to try Element,\\n\\nyou can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nToday's episode is also brought to us by Maui Nui,\\n\\nwhich I can confidently say is the most nutrient dense\\n\\nand delicious red meat available.\\n\\nMaui Nui spent nearly a decade building\\n\\na USDA certified wild harvesting system\\n\\nto help balance invasive deer populations\\n\\non the island of Maui.\\n\\nI've talked before on this podcast\\n\\nand we've had guests on this podcast\\n\\nthat have emphasized the critical role\\n\\nof getting quality protein,\\n\\nnot just for muscle repair and protein synthesis,\\n\\nbut also for repair of all tissues,\\n\\nincluding brain tissue on a day-to-day basis.\\n\\nAnd the general rule of thumb for that\\n\\nis one gram of quality protein\\n\\nper pound of body weight per day.\\n\\nWith Maui Nui meats, you can accomplish that very easily\\n\\nand you can do that without ingesting an excess of calories,\\n\\nwhich is also critical for immediate and long-term health.\\n\\nI should say that Maui Nui meats\\n\\nare not only extremely high quality,\\n\\nbut they are also delicious.\\n\\nI particularly like their jerky, so their venison jerky.\\n\\nI also have had Maui Nui venison in various recipes,\\n\\nincluding ground venison, some venison steaks.\\n\\nAnd I love the taste of the venison.\\n\\nIt's lean, but it doesn't taste overly lean or dry at all.\\n\\nIt's incredibly delicious.\\n\\nSo if you'd like to try Maui Nui venison,\\n\\ngo to mauinuivenison.com slash Huberman\\n\\nto get 20% off your first order.\\n\\nAgain,

discuss\\n\\non the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\n\\nyou can go to Live Momentus spelled O-U-S,\\n\\nlivemomentus.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nAnd I should just mention\\n\\nthat the library of those supplements is constantly expanding.\\n\\nAgain, that's livemomentus.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nLet's talk about headaches.\\n\\nAnd as we are soon going to learn,\\n\\nthere are different types of headaches\\n\\nand different types of headaches arise from changes\\n\\nin different types of tissues in the head area\\n\\nand indeed in the neck area as well.\\n\\nNow, one of the key things to understand\\n\\nis that if you want relief from a headache,\\n\\nyou need to understand which tissue is mainly involved\\n\\nin creating that type of headache.\\n\\nSo for instance, many people suffer\\n\\nfrom what are called tension headaches.\\n\\nNow, tension headaches are a little bit of a misnomer\\n\\nbecause many people might think,\\n\\noh, tension, I'm under a lot of tension and stress\\n\\nand therefore I get tension headaches.\\n\\nAnd indeed stress can cause tension headaches,\\n\\nbut tension headaches are really the sort of headache\\n\\nthat you feel around the top part of the head,\\n\\nnot the very top,\\n\\nbut sort of where you would put a headband,\\n\\nso above the eyes and around the head.\\n\\nIt doesn't have to be experienced\\n\\nall the way around the head,\\n\\nbut the main underlying reason,\\n\\nthat is the tissue system\\n\\nthat mainly underlies tension headaches\\n\\nis the muscular system.\\n\\nThere are a lot of muscles on the skull, believe it or not,\\n\\nof course on the neck\\n\\nand they allow you to move your neck and head.\\n\\nBut there are a lot of muscles\\n\\nthat lie parallel to the skull.\\n\\nAnd oftentimes those muscles will undergo\\n\\nexcessive amounts of constriction.\\n\\nNow there are of course muscles in the jaw\\n\\nthat can also lead to headache\\n\\nand jaw ache and things of that sort\\n\\nand neck aches and headaches.\\n\\nSo what we're really pointing out here\\n\\nis that the muscles are a key player\\n\\nin the formation of different types of headache,\\n\\ntension headache in particular.\\n\\nBut of course muscles and muscle tension\\n\\ncan be involved in the other types of headaches as well.\\n\\nOkay, so I just want to highlight muscular issues\\n\\nas one particular source of the ache in headaches.\\n\\nThe other tissue that can be prominently involved\\n\\nin generating the ache of a headache\\n\\nare the so-called meninges.\\n\\nNow the meninges, in addition to being a fun word to say,\\n\\nare a bunch of tissues that line the outside of the brain\\n\\nand reside between the brain and the skull.\\n\\nSo you might think, okay, between the brain and the skull,\\n\\nthere's probably just a little bit of fluid\\n\\nand the brain is right up next to the skull,\\n\\nbut it turns out that's not the case.\\n\\nThe brain is actually encased in a very thick,\\n\\nvery durable sack or casing\\n\\nthat's wrapped around it tight like saran wrap.\\n\\nIt actually has a name, which is Dura, D-U-R-A.\\n\\nAnd so you can remember Dura durable.\\n\\nAnd having done some surgeries,\\n\\nmany surgeries before on brains of different types,\\n\\nranging from human,\\n\\neven though I'm not a neurosurgeon as a clinician,\\n\\nranging from human to other types of species,\\n\\nwhat you find is that the Dura is exceedingly durable.\\n\\nGetting through this thing\\n\\nreally requires a very sharp razor blade.\\n\\nSo the brain is actually sitting in a very fibrous like sack\\n\\nthat you simply could not open up with your fingertips\\n\\nunder any conditions.\\n\\nIt's really durable.\\n\\nThe meninges are in that general area\\n\\nand also encasing the brain.\\n\\nAnd the meninges provide an additional buffer\\n\\nbetween the brain and the Dura and the skull.\\n\\nSo again, you don't want to think about the brain\\n\\nas just sitting right next to the skull.\\n\\nIt's close by,\\n\\nbut there are a bunch of other thin, fibrous tissues,\\n\\nmany of which are very thin and fragile.\\n\\nAnd others of which such as the Dura\\n\\nthat are very, very strong because they're very fibrous.\\n\\nAlmost like if you've ever felt, for instance,\\n\\nthe sail of a sailboat, you might think,\\n\\noh, it's just this big flapping sheet in the wind.\\n\\nIt is anything but a sheet in the wind.\\n\\nIt is a very, very strong and durable material.\\n\\nNow the proximity of the Dura and the meninges to the brain\\n\\nand the fact that everything is wrapped very tightly together\\n\\nand the fact that there's a lot of vasculature.\\n\\nSo that would be arteries, blood vessels, and capillaries\\n\\nare all in that area on the top of the brain\\n\\nand throughout the brain.\\n\\nThe fact that all of that is in very close proximity\\n\\nand wrapped really tight in this very durable sack\\n\\nis one of the reasons why when blood vessels or arteries\\n\\nor both become dilated, they open,\\n\\nthere creates a pressure between the brain and those tissues.\\n\\nAnd because there isn't much distance between the tissues\\n\\nlike the Dura and the meninges and the skull,\\n\\nthere's also pressure that allows for the brain\\n\\nto literally sneak up or I should say,\\n\\ngive the impression that your brain is expanding\\n\\nup against your skull.\\n\\nSo the point here is that while muscular tension\\n\\ncan give rise to headache,\\n\\nthe other thing that can give rise to headache\\n\\nis so-called vasodilation, the expansion or the widening\\n\\nof the arteries, blood vessels, and capillaries.\\n\\nAnd one of the reasons why that gives rise to headache\\n\\nis because there's simply not a lot of space\\n\\nfor that expansion to go.\\n\\nIt doesn't allow anything except for the brain\\n\\nto push up against that very durable tissue\\n\\nand that very durable tissue to push up against the skull.\\n\\nAnd even though the brain itself\\n\\ndoesn't have pain receptors, that's right.\\n\\nThe brain itself doesn't have pain receptors.\\n\\nThat is why a neurosurgeon can take off a piece of skull\\n\\nand can probe around in the brain with an electrode\\n\\nand the person is completely unaware.\\n\\nAnd in order to get through the skull,\\n\\nthat of course a little skin flap\\n\\nhas to be removed from the skull.\\n\\nAnd that requires a little bit of topical anesthetic,\\n\\nbut really you don't need any anesthetic\\n\\nto go into the brain itself\\n\\nbecause there aren't pain receptors on the brain itself.\\n\\nHowever, the tissues surrounding the brain,\\n\\nsuch as the dura, the meninges, and the vasculature\\n\\nthat then reaches up, believe it or not, into the skull,\\n\\nthe vasculature doesn't actually stop right beneath the skull.\\n\\nIt actually, blood vessels get into the skull\\n\\nand there are actually portals\\n\\nby which blood can move within the skull itself.\\n\\nWell, what that means is that since all of the tissues\\n\\nare very close by and very compact\\n\\nwith respect to one another,\\n\\nany increase in the size of the portals\\n\\nthat allow movement of blood there\\n\\nand the fact that there are what are called nociceptors,\\n\\nN-O-C-I, nociceptors,\\n\\nthese are essentially pain receptors,\\n\\nbecause of the presence of pain receptors\\n\\nin the tissues around the brain,\\n\\nwhen there's an increase in the size\\n\\nof those vascular portals,\\n\\nthe arteries, capillaries, and vessels,\\n\\nwe experience that as intense pain and pressure.\\n\\nAnd fortunately, there are excellent treatments\\n\\nfor dealing with that intense pain and pressure,\\n\\nbut keep in mind that the intense pain and pressure\\n\\nthat is the consequence of vasodilation,\\n\\nthat is the widening of these different vascular portals,\\n\\nis very different than the type of pain that arises\\n\\nfrom muscular tension,\\n\\nas is the case with tension headache.\\n\\nOkay, so now we have two sources of pain,\\n\\nthat is the ache in headache,\\n\\nand there are two more that we need to think about\\n\\nin trying to better understand\\n\\nthe different types of headaches that we'll discuss,\\n\\nand in terms of trying to understand\\n\\nwhich are going to be the best treatments\\n\\nfor the different types of headaches.\\n\\nAnd those are neural and inflammatory responses.\\n\\nSo let's talk about the neural type first.\\n\\nThere is a type of headache\\n\\nthat many people unfortunately suffer from.\\n\\nWe'll get into this in a bunch more detail in a moment.\\n\\nThose are called cluster headaches.\\n\\nCluster headaches are headaches that arise\\n\\nnot from the surface,\\n\\npeople don't experience them as kind of a tightening\\n\\nof the forehead and the neck and the jaw,\\n\\nbut rather it feels as if the headache\\n\\nis coming from deep within the head,\\n\\nand in particular from behind the orbit\\n\\nof one or the other eyes,\\n\\nand sometimes both eyes.\\n\\nFor those of you that have ever experienced cluster headaches,\\n\\nthey are extremely painful, even the more,\\n\\nor I should say the relatively more minor cluster headaches\\n\\nare extremely painful,\\n\\nand the severe ones are exceedingly painful.\\n\\nCluster headaches arise from deep,\\n\\nor we get the sensation that they are rising\\n\\nfrom deep within our head,\\n\\nas opposed from the surface inward,\\n\\nbecause they are neural in origin,\\n\\nand there's a particular nerve pathway\\n\\ncalled the trigeminal nerve\\n\\nthat often is the origin of these cluster headaches\\n\\nthat people experience behind the eye.\\n\\nThe trigeminal as the name suggests has three branches,\\n\\ntri, okay, so there's a branch\\n\\nthat essentially extends to the eye.\\n\\nThere's also a branch that extends to the mandible,\\n\\nright, to the lip,\\n\\nand there's a branch that extends more or less\\n\\nto the nasal area.\\n\\nAnd so this trigeminal nerve becomes inflamed,\\n\\nor in other ways is hyper-activated in some cases,\\n\\nand that causes the deep pain below the eye\\n\\nbecause it is that first branch of the trigeminal nerve,\\n\\nwhich is the ophthalmic branch,\\n\\nwhich tends to be activated first.\\n\\nSo people start feeling as if there's a pain behind their eye,\\n\\nin particular on one side.\\n\\nOftentimes there's lacrimation, which is tearing up.\\n\\nThere can be some nasal discharge.\\n\\nAnother common symptom of this type of headache,\\n\\nthat is the cluster headache,\\n\\nis that the pupils sometimes will become very small,\\n\\nthe pupils of the eyes,\\n\\nand they won't dilate even in darkness.\\n\\nSo there are a bunch of things that are going on\\n\\non one or both sides of the face\\n\\nthat seem to arise from deep within the head,\\n\\nor it's almost as if it's coming from the brain outward,\\n\\nand that's because it's neural in origin.\\n\\nOkay, so we've got muscular origins of headaches,\\n\\nwe've got meningeal origins of headaches,\\n\\nthat is the stuff around the brain,\\n\\nand as it relates to the vasculature,\\n\\nand we have neural origins of headaches.\\n\\nAnd of course, there's inflammation origins of headaches.\\n\\nNow, inflammation is a term\\n\\nthat gets thrown around a lot these days.\\n\\nPeople are talking about, you know,\\n\\nthis reduces inflammation, and inflammation is bad,\\n\\nand I suppose in some cases,\\n\\nand when inflammation is really widespread\\n\\nacross the brain or body, it's bad.\\n\\nBut I don't think any of us should think about inflammation\\n\\nper se as bad.\\n\\nWhat I mean is, inflammation is just one form of signaling\\n\\nin the body, which of course includes the brain.\\n\\nInflammation of a tissue is one way in which a set of cells,\\n\\nso these could be, for instance, cells of the immune system,\\n\\nand we cover this in a detailed episode\\n\\nall about the immune system.\\n\\nIf you'd like to check that out,\\n\\nyou go to hubermanlab.com,\\n\\njust put into our search function immune system,\\n\\nand you can find that episode.\\n\\nBy the way, all of our episodes are searchable by keyword\\n\\nat hubermanlab.com, and it'll take you to specific episodes\\n\\nand timestamps for the topics you're interested in.\\n\\nSo for sake of this discussion about headache,\\n\\ninflammation is going to be the case\\n\\nwhen one particular tissue in and around the head area\\n\\nis releasing molecules, cytokines,\\n\\nwhich sometimes are called inflammatory cytokines,\\n\\nbut there are also non-inflammatory\\n\\nor anti-inflammatory cytokines,\\n\\nbut inflammatory molecules that are signaling\\n\\nto the rest of the body,\\n\\nhey, there's something going on here.\\n\\nThere's either some intrusive object,\\n\\nand indeed, if you were to get a BB or a splinter\\n\\ninto a particular skin area,\\n\\nthere'd be a lot of inflammation.\\n\\nSo it could be the introduction of a foreign physical object\\n\\ninto an area that will cause inflammation.\\n\\nIt can be the presence of some sort of local toxin\\n\\nin that area.\\n\\nIt could be a more systemic inflammation.\\n\\nNonetheless, inflammation in the neck and head area\\n\\nor frankly, anywhere within the sinus area.\\n\\nSo this would include the mouth, the nose, around the eyes,\\n\\nbecause the sinuses,\\n\\nmany of us think of sinuses as just our nose,\\n\\nbut actually if I were to show you a skull,\\n\\na human skull or any other kind of skull,\\n\\nyou'd be very hopefully intrigued to learn\\n\\nthat the skull is just not one big piece of solid bone\\n\\nor a top with a jaw below it.\\n\\nIt actually has all these small\\n\\nwhat are called fenestrations,\\n\\nlittle holes and canals that run through the skull\\n\\nand through the depth of the skull, like little tubes.\\n\\nYou've got them down here on your mandible.\\n\\nYou've got them above your lips.\\n\\nYou have them on either sides of your nose.\\n\\nThose are the sinuses.\\n\\nThe sinuses allow the passage of different fluids\\n\\nthrough the skull because the skull, even though it's bone,\\n\\nit's not a dead tissue, right?\\n\\nIn a live person or animal,\\n\\nthe skull is a very active living tissue.\\n\\nIndeed, all bone is active living tissue\\n\\nand it needs to be nourished with blood.\\n\\nIt needs to be nourished with cerebral spinal fluid.\\n\\nIn the case of the skull,\\n\\nit needs to be nourished with all sorts of important things.\\n\\nSo those sinuses oftentimes can become clogged\\n\\nas is in the case with sinus headache,\\n\\nwhich we'll talk about in a little bit,\\n\\nbut more generally, any time there's inflammation\\n\\nof one given area of the body, so it could be a shoulder,\\n\\nit could be the neck, it could be the mouth,\\n\\nit could be the nose, or in the case of the headache,\\n\\nit could be any portion of the head or neck.\\n\\nWhat happens is inflammation,\\n\\nwhile it's a very efficient signal,\\n\\nit's much like the siren on an ambulance or a police car\\n\\nin that it sends out a very broad signal\\n\\nthat's very clear something is wrong here\\n\\nand needs to be dealt with, it's not very specific.\\n\\nSo it's very robust, but it's not very specific.\\n\\nSo for instance, if there's a little bacterial infection\\n\\nor a little viral infection,\\n\\nthe inflammation response to that site of infection\\n\\ntends to be far more widespread\\n\\nthan the actual site of infection.\\n\\nIt's a little bit different when you have a foreign object\\n\\nthere like a splinter or some other foreign object,\\n\\nthat tends to be a bit more localized.\\n\\nAnd the immune system is always trying to limit\\n\\nthe extent of inflammation\\n\\nby putting in different scar tissues.\\n\\nIndeed, a lot of the things that we think of\\n\\nas kind of gross pussy,\\n\\npustules and boils and things like that,\\n\\nI know it's a gross topic,\\n\\nare ways in which our body tries to restrict\\n\\nthe amount of inflammation.\\n\\nBut the face area and the head itself\\n\\nare so heavily infused with blood vessels\\n\\nand there's a constant perfusion, as we say,\\n\\nof blood and cerebral spinal fluid and other things\\n\\nthrough this incredibly metabolically active tissue\\n\\nthat we call our brain and our eyes.\\n\\nThose are by far the most metabolically active tissues\\n\\nin our entire body.\\n\\nEven if we're running hundreds of miles\\n\\nin ultra marathons, your brain is still far more\\n\\nmetabolically demanding than all the muscles\\n\\nof your body combined, no matter what the conditions.\\n\\nBecause of that, there tends to be a generalization\\n\\nor a spreading out of any inflammatory response.\\n\\nAnd that inflammatory response then can trigger\\n\\nthe pain mechanisms or what we've experienced\\n\\nas pain mechanisms in the other three types of tissues\\n\\nthat we talked about.\\n\\nSo for instance, if you have a systemic infection\\n\\nor you're experiencing inflammation of any kind\\n\\nand it has anything to do with or encroaches\\n\\non the face or head area, that can easily\\n\\nand almost always spills over into activation\\n\\nof nerve cells, can give rise to neural-based headache\\n\\nor to the meninges and can give rise to meningeal headaches.\\n\\nAnd of course, to the muscles and to muscular type headaches.\\n\\nSo we've got muscular origins of the ache in headache.\\n\\nWe have meningeal origins of the ache in headache.\\n\\nWe have neural origins of the ache in headache\\n\\nand we have inflammation-based origins\\n\\nof the ache in headache.\\n\\nAnd that pertains to all the different types of headaches\\n\\nthat we're going to talk about.\\n\\nAnd it's important to keep in mind\\n\\nthat there are these different sources\\n\\nof the ache in headache and that sometimes they exist alone\\n\\nand sometimes they exist in combination.\\n\\nHowever, and this is an important however,\\n\\nall pain or I should say all experience of pain\\n\\nas a perception is going to be neural in origin.\\n\\nWhen we experience pain, whether or not it's a pinprick\\n\\nor a cut, stub our toe, we trip and fall or a headache,\\n\\nit is neural in origin.\\n\\nIt is the nervous system and nerve cells\\n\\nthat are going to carry that signal\\n\\nthat we perceive as pain.\\n\\nSo as we talk about the different sources of pain\\n\\nand different types of headache,\\n\\nwe will also talk about, of course,\\n\\nI think what most people are interested\\n\\nin today's discussion, the different treatments\\n\\nfor the different types of headache\\n\\nand why each of those different treatments work.\\n\\nBut by understanding a little bit about how pain arises\\n\\nin the nervous system and certainly by understanding\\n\\nthe different types of headaches,\\n\\nwhat is a tension headache?\\n\\nI gave you some impression that it's running around\\n\\nyour head like a headband in many cases\\n\\nversus cluster headache, which starts deep below the eye.\\n\\nOften it feels as if it's emerging from deep in the brain\\n\\nversus migraine, which we'll get into in a moment.\\n\\nBy understanding the different types of headaches,\\n\\nyou should be able to quickly pinpoint\\n\\nwhat type of headache you have,\\n\\nwhat types of tissues are likely involved\\n\\nand therefore what types of treatments\\n\\nare going to most quickly and most completely relieve\\n\\nthat type of headache.\\n\\nOkay, so for the next three to five minutes,\\n\\nand I promise no more, I'm going to explain how pain arises\\n\\nat the level of nerve cells.\\n\\nAnd suppose this is one of those times\\n\\nwhen if I had a highlighter pen that could go out\\n\\nacross the microphones and speakers leading to your ears,\\n\\nI would use it here because what I'm about to tell you\\n\\nis perhaps one of the most important things\\n\\nto understand about your nervous system,\\n\\nthat is your brain and you,\\n\\nwhich is that while you have trillions of neurons,\\n\\nand we hear that you have trillions\\n\\nand different types of neurons in your brain\\n\\nand they come in different shapes and sizes\\n\\nand do different things and some make dopamine\\n\\nand some make serotonin and some make glutamate\\n\\nand on and on, the key distinction\\n\\namong different types of neurons,\\n\\nthat is the three types of neurons\\n\\nthat I believe everybody, scientists or no,\\n\\neverybody should understand exist\\n\\nare some neurons, nerve cells,\\n\\nare what we call motor neurons\\n\\nin the sense that they control the contraction of muscles.\\n\\nSometimes for walking, other neurons control\\n\\nthe movements of your fingers,\\n\\nscientists call those digits, other ones, your toes.\\n\\nThey also control the beating of your heart,\\n\\nalthough that's a slightly different mechanism\\n\\nand slightly different type of tissue\\n\\nthan is involved in generating motor movements of your limbs.\\n\\nThese are neurons that we call motor neurons\\n\\nbecause their goal or their purpose, I should say,\\n\\nthey don't really know what their goal or purpose is,\\n\\nbut what they do is they make sure that muscles contract\\n\\nso that certain things happen in your body,\\n\\nlike your heartbeats or you move your limbs,\\n\\nyou lift your eyelids or your eyebrows rather\\n\\nand so on and so forth.\\n\\nOther types of neurons are what we call sensory neurons.\\n\\nThey communicate the same way that motor neurons do,\\n\\nthat is they fire what we call action potentials,\\n\\nwhich are just electrical signals,\\n\\nthey release no transmitters like any other neuron,\\n\\nbut they respond to certain events in the environment\\n\\nor the environment within the body,\\n\\nbut they are not responsible\\n\\nfor generating muscular contractions.\\n\\nSo we call these sensory neurons.\\n\\nSome sensory neurons sense light touch,\\n\\nother sensory neurons sense firm touch,\\n\\nother sensory neurons sense pain,\\n\\nother sensory neurons sense light brushing on the skin.\\n\\nIn fact, you have sensory neurons, believe it or not,\\n\\nsensory neurons that respond specifically\\n\\nto the light brushing of a hand across your skin,\\n\\nany region of your body.\\n\\nAnd if that particular region of your body\\n\\nhappens to have hair on it,\\n\\nand you stroke the skin in the direction\\n\\nthat the hairs lay down,\\n\\nwe experience that as pleasurable.\\n\\nWhereas if you stroke in the direction opposite\\n\\nto the way the hairs lay down,\\n\\nwe experience that as not pleasurable.\\n\\nSo these sensory neurons respond in some cases,\\n\\nfor instance, within the auditory system,\\n\\nthey respond to sound waves in your eye,\\n\\nthey respond to photons of light,\\n\\nsometimes photons of light of particular wavelengths\\n\\nthat we think of as red, green, blue, and so on.\\n\\nSensory neurons don't move muscles,\\n\\nthey respond to things in the environment\\n\\nand they exist within us.\\n\\nSo we have sensory neurons that sense, for instance,\\n\\npressure within our head or pressure within our gut,\\n\\nhow full or empty our gut is,\\n\\npain within our tissues like our liver\\n\\nor any kind of other internal organ.\\n\\nSo we've got motor neurons, sensory neurons,\\n\\nand then the last kind of neuron\\n\\nis what we call modulatory neurons.\\n\\nThese are the ones that adjust the relationship\\n\\nbetween the sensory neurons and the motor neurons\\n\\nto determine whether or not we do anything\\n\\nin response to a sensory input.\\n\\nThat is whether or not if a sensory neuron fires,\\n\\nsends an electrical potential,\\n\\nwhether or not it will generate a motor change.\\n\\nLet me give you a very simple example of this.\\n\\nSo for those of you listening,\\n\\nI'll just explain what I'm doing,\\n\\nand for those of you watching, you'll be able to see,\\n\\nI'm holding my hand out in front of me.\\n\\nIf I were to touch the top of my hand with my fingertip,\\n\\nI can deliberately override,\\n\\nthat is I can modulate that more typical reflex,\\n\\nwhich is that when something touches us,\\n\\nif we're not aware of where it's coming from,\\n\\nwe typically move away from that thing that touches.\\n\\nThis is a very natural response,\\n\\nbut we can decide we're not going to move away,\\n\\nwe can decide to stay still,\\n\\nor we can decide to move toward the thing that touches us.\\n\\nBut typically if you were to walk up to somebody\\n\\nand you were to touch them,\\n\\nthey'd either turn toward you\\n\\non the side that you touch them, or they'd step away.\\n\\nIt's rare that they're going to step into you,\\n\\nbut you could decide that you were not going to move away,\\n\\nor you could step into the direction of touch.\\n\\nAnd that's because you have modulatory neurons\\n\\nthat can adjust the conversation\\n\\nin a very context dependent way\\n\\nas to whether or not the sensory neuron\\n\\nwill cause motor neurons to contract or not, okay?\\n\\nSo we've got motor neurons, sensory neurons,\\n\\nand modulatory neurons,\\n\\nand you're probably thinking by now,\\n\\nwhy are we talking about this?\\n\\nI thought we were going to talk about headache,\\n\\nI thought we were going to talk about treatments\\n\\nfor headache, but this turns out to be very important\\n\\nbecause you could imagine, and in a moment I'll explain how,\\n\\nlet's say you have tension headaches.\\n\\nYou're somebody that has the classic symptoms\\n\\nof tension headache.\\n\\nLet me tell you what those are.\\n\\nThese are headaches, again, that occur more or less\\n\\non the kind of a headband like fashion,\\n\\nor they tend to start there and exist around the head.\\n\\nThese are very common.\\n\\nThey can arise from a number of different sources,\\n\\nrise from sleep deprivation,\\n\\nthey can arise from excessive use of caffeine intake.\\n\\nWe'll talk about why that is.\\n\\nThey can arise from stress.\\n\\nThey can arise from very low level viral infections\\n\\nor bacterial infections,\\n\\nbut we experience these as headaches\\n\\nwhere you've been thinking too hard or working too hard\\n\\nor life has been stressful.\\n\\nThey're often also associated with jaw pain\\n\\nand jaw tightness and neck tightness.\\n\\nSo tension headaches,\\n\\neverything you'd imagine muscular tension could cause.\\n\\nWell, if you want to treat tension headache,\\n\\nyou can imagine that because all headache is neural\\n\\nthat you'd want to go after some sort of neural mechanism\\n\\nto treat them.\\n\\nBut of course, we now know\\n\\nthat there are three types of neurons.\\n\\nThere are motor neurons, sensory neurons\\n\\nand modulatory neurons.\\n\\nSo we have choices.\\n\\nWe can say, okay, do we want to turn off the muscles\\n\\nin the head, jaw and neck that are hyper-contracted?\\n\\nFor instance, you want to take a muscle relaxer\\n\\nor relaxant,\\n\\nor would you want to try\\n\\nand change the sensory input itself?\\n\\nMaybe don't change the way the muscles are behaving,\\n\\nbut shut off the sensory part of it,\\n\\nyour ability to sense it.\\n\\nThere are certainly ways you can do that.\\n\\nOr would you want to adjust the modulatory neurons?\\n\\nWould you want to make it such that you have the headache,\\n\\nbut you don't perceive the headache?\\n\\nThat is you cut off communication\\n\\nbetween the sensor and the motor\\n\\nso that the muscles relax.\\n\\nTurns out there are treatments and approaches\\n\\nfor each and every one of those.\\n\\nEach and every one of those has different advantages\\n\\nand disadvantages.\\n\\nBut as you can quickly see,\\n\\nwe are going to have different types of headaches\\n\\nand different approaches to treating headache.\\n\\nBut if you keep in the back of your mind\\n\\nthat you have neurons that contract muscles\\n\\nto create movement or tension of muscles,\\n\\nremember you can turn off those neurons\\n\\nand allow those muscles to relax.\\n\\nYou have sensory neurons that sense input\\n\\nand actually sense the pain.\\n\\nAnd you have modulatory neurons,\\n\\nwhich can allow you to adjust the relationship\\n\\nbetween the sensory neurons and the motor neurons.\\n\\nAnd of course, some of you are probably screaming at me\\n\\nby now saying, wait, why would you ever want to deal\\n\\nwith the motor neurons or the modulatory neurons\\n\\nonce you want to just go straight to the source\\n\\nand just cut off the pain?\\n\\nAh, well, the problem there is that many painkillers\\n\\nhave other issues as well.\\n\\nIn particular, they can be sedative.\\n\\nMany of them can be habit-forming or even addictive.\\n\\nAnd for many people, not all, but many people,\\n\\nthey don't want to take drugs,\\n\\nwhether or not they're over-the-counter or prescription drugs\\n\\nor even more natural supplement-based type treatments.\\n\\nAnd they would rather use, for instance,\\n\\na behavioral approach in which they can modulate,\\n\\nthey can deliberately turn off the communication\\n\\nbetween sensory neurons and motor neurons.\\n\\nIt turns out those approaches exist as well.\\n\\nOkay, so at this point, I promise you\\n\\nthat I'm not going to give you any more of a biology lesson\\n\\nin terms of pain sensing and headaches\\n\\nas a more conceptual phenomenon.\\n\\nInstead, what I'd like to do next\\n\\nis talk about the different types of headaches.\\n\\nAnd I think this is something that's very important\\n\\nand not often discussed, except for those people out there\\n\\nthat unfortunately suffer repeatedly\\n\\nfrom certain kinds of headaches,\\n\\nlike migraine or cluster or attention headache.\\n\\nBut I think for most people out there\\n\\nwho experience headache, and again, that is everybody\\n\\nat some point experiences headache,\\n\\nrather than just think of headache as one thing,\\n\\nunderstanding the major types of headache\\n\\nand how they differ from and are similar to one another\\n\\nwill really help you identify\\n\\nwhat the best source of treatments for those are.\\n\\nSo I'd like to talk about\\n\\nwhat the different types of headache are now.\\n\\nThe first type of headache we're going to discuss\\n\\nis the tension type headache.\\n\\nAgain, tension type headaches tend to start off,\\n\\nnot always, but tend to start off\\n\\nas more or less a halo or a headband\\n\\naround the forehead in the area above the eyes,\\n\\noften also include the jaw, the neck muscles,\\n\\nand can extend even into the upper back.\\n\\nAgain, this can be caused by some low level of infection,\\n\\nbut more often than not, tension type headaches\\n\\nare going to come on\\n\\nbecause of some chronic psychological stress,\\n\\nusually combined with lack of sleep,\\n\\nusually combined with lifestyle issues.\\n\\nAnd of course, without getting into a long discussion\\n\\nabout it, anytime you have lack of sleep,\\n\\nyou're going to have excessive stress.\\n\\nAnytime you have excessive stress,\\n\\nyou're going to have to make sure you're offsetting that\\n\\nby getting proper sleep.\\n\\nMost people don't when they're under excessive stress.\\n\\nBy the way, we have excellent tools\\n\\nor grounded in excellent science\\n\\navailable to you at zero cost.\\n\\nIf you are experienced chronic stress\\n\\nor even short-term stress,\\n\\nwe have a master stress episode\\n\\nof the Huberman Lab podcast.\\n\\nAgain, just go to hubermanlab.com\\n\\nand all that's timestamped for you.\\n\\nTension type headaches begin in more or less\\n\\na headband pattern,\\n\\nbut can really extend to other tissues as well.\\n\\nNot so often in the face,\\n\\nbut really the head and often will start to climb up\\n\\ntoward the top of the head.\\n\\nThey are not always in this halo pattern.\\n\\nSometimes they can be localized to one area,\\n\\nsuch as the back of the head or the front of the head\\n\\nor one side of the head more than others.\\n\\nAnd that's often the case\\n\\nbecause of tension within muscles of the neck\\n\\nthat tend to bias the ache towards one side of the head.\\n\\nI'd like to take a quick break\\n\\nand acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.\\n\\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1,\\n\\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\\n\\nthat covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.\\n\\nI've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,\\n\\nso I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.\\n\\nThe reason I started taking Athletic Greens\\n\\nand the reason I still take Athletic Greens once\\n\\nor usually twice a day is that it gets to be the probiotics\\n\\nthat I need for gut health.\\n\\nOur gut is very important.\\n\\nIt's populated by gut microbiota\\n\\nthat communicate with the brain, the immune system,\\n\\nand basically all the biological systems of our body\\n\\nto strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.\\n\\nAnd those probiotics and Athletic Greens are optimal\\n\\nand vital for microbiotic health.\\n\\nIn addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,\\n\\nvitamins, and minerals that make sure\\n\\nthat all of my foundational nutritional needs are met.\\n\\nAnd it tastes great.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\\n\\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,\\n\\nand they'll give you five free travel packs\\n\\nthat make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens\\n\\nwhile you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.\\n\\nAnd they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.\\n\\nAgain, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman\\n\\nto get the five free travel packs\\n\\nand the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.\\n\\nThe other type of headache\\n\\nthat unfortunately is very common is migraine headaches.\\n\\nMigraine headaches are defined generally\\n\\nas disorders of recurring attacks of headaches.\\n\\nSo people who get migraines\\n\\noften get them in a recurring fashion.\\n\\nSome people get them very often,\\n\\nother people get them less often,\\n\\nbut migraines are very debilitating.\\n\\nThe numbers, that is the prevalence of migraine,\\n\\nis still pretty debated.\\n\\nOne thing that we know for sure\\n\\nis that females suffer from migraine headaches\\n\\nat a rate at least threefold higher than do males.\\n\\nAnd surprisingly, this does not seem\\n\\nto have any direct hormonal origin,\\n\\nbecause we're also going to talk about hormonal headaches,\\n\\nthat is, headaches that relate to a dip in estrogen\\n\\nand progesterone, a particular phase of the menstrual cycle,\\n\\nthat is the ovulatory cycle.\\n\\nSo there's a bit of a mystery here,\\n\\nand the mystery is, why is it that migraine headaches occur\\n\\nat such greater frequency in females,\\n\\neven independently of the menstrual cycle?\\n\\nSo when you control for changes in hormones,\\n\\nthat still appears to be the case.\\n\\nAnd overall, migraines are very common.\\n\\nNow, the numbers on migraine and just how common migraine is\\n\\nare extremely wide.\\n\\nThis was a little bit frustrating for me\\n\\nin researching this episode.\\n\\nYou will find, for instance,\\n\\nthat 17% of women suffer from migraines.\\n\\nYou will also hear that 6% of males suffer from migraines.\\n\\nYou will also hear that 43% of females suffer from migraine,\\n\\nthat is recurring headaches that qualifies migraine headaches,\\n\\nand that 17% of men suffer from migraine headaches\\n\\non a recurring basis, which is, again,\\n\\nthe definition of a migraine headache,\\n\\nor one of the key definitions.\\n\\nSo all we can say for sure is that many, many millions\\n\\nof people, maybe even billions of people,\\n\\nsuffer from migraine headaches.\\n\\nIt's kind of a staggering thing to contemplate,\\n\\nbut we know it's extremely common,\\n\\nand we know that it's more prevalent in females.\\n\\nIn any of the studies that you will find\\n\\nin terms of, that compare the overall prevalence of headache,\\n\\nit's going to be higher,\\n\\nsubstantially higher in females and males,\\n\\ndoes not seem to be related to the ovulatory menstrual cycle.\\n\\nThere are some interesting facts related to that\\n\\nthat I'll just touch on for a moment.\\n\\nPregnancy, for whatever reason,\\n\\nseems to be protective against migraine headaches.\\n\\nThat is, women who suffer from recurring migraines\\n\\nbefore they get pregnant, when they get pregnant,\\n\\nand often after they give birth,\\n\\nthey experience fewer migraine headaches.\\n\\nSo there may be something hormonal,\\n\\nit may be something else.\\n\\nWhat do we know for sure?\\n\\nWe know that headache, that is the ache in headache,\\n\\nis neural.\\n\\nSo whether or not the origins are hormonal,\\n\\nor whether or not the origins are inflammation,\\n\\nor gut microbiome, or some other feature\\n\\nof the body-brain axis,\\n\\nat this point, all we know is that neural pain,\\n\\nor the experience of pain at the neural level\\n\\nis the final common pathway,\\n\\nand it's more prevalent in females.\\n\\nSo as I mentioned, migraines tend to be recurring.\\n\\nSo some people get them once a week,\\n\\nsome people get them once a month,\\n\\nsome people get them far more frequently,\\n\\nthat they can be extremely debilitating.\\n\\nOftentimes, people who experience migraine,\\n\\nbecause it is a recurring phenomenon,\\n\\nwill know when a migraine is coming on.\\n\\nThey'll say, my migraine is coming on.\\n\\nThey kind of sense it coming.\\n\\nThere's this notion of aura,\\n\\nand we'll talk about aura in a little bit.\\n\\nSome people think of aura just as visual aura,\\n\\nor the sense of kind of a haloing of light,\\n\\nor the sense that there's something outside the body.\\n\\nThe actual definition of aura is that it's the experience\\n\\nthat something is about to happen.\\n\\nIt's this kind of feeling of anticipation.\\n\\nIt's not deja vu, deja vu is different,\\n\\nand very interesting in its own right, but different.\\n\\nIt's this feeling that something's about to happen.\\n\\nAnd the fact that aura is such a prominent feature\\n\\nof migraine headaches, or at least that people feel\\n\\nthat the headache is coming on long before they feel\\n\\nthe actual ache of the headache\\n\\nand the other debilitating symptoms,\\n\\nsuggests that migraine has something of deep neural origin,\\n\\nthat it arises from deep within the nervous system,\\n\\nspinal cord and brain,\\n\\nand that it's not something like a tension headache\\n\\nthat is going from outside in,\\n\\nthe constriction of the muscles in the jaw and head.\\n\\nSo migraine headaches are very different\\n\\nthan tension headaches,\\n\\neven in terms of how they come on or their onset.\\n\\nThe other feature of migraine headaches\\n\\nthat I think is important to note\\n\\nis that dilation of the vessels,\\n\\nremember the vasodilation,\\n\\nso the widening of those pipes that we call arteries,\\n\\nvessels and capillaries,\\n\\nis a very prominent feature of migraine.\\n\\nAnd fortunately that allows for very particular types\\n\\nof treatment and ways of dealing with this pain\\n\\nspecific to migraine headaches.\\n\\nThe other feature that's common in migraine headaches\\n\\nis so-called photophobia.\\n\\nMany of you are probably familiar with photophobia,\\n\\nif you've ever been sleep deprived.\\n\\nSimply if you're sleep deprived\\n\\nand you go outside in the morning,\\n\\nthe light is going to seem very, very bright,\\n\\nmuch brighter than were you to have had\\n\\na really good night's sleep.\\n\\nAnd that's because during sleep,\\n\\nthere are all sorts of reset mechanisms in the brain.\\n\\nThere's the washing out of metabolic debris\\n\\nand things in the brain,\\n\\nthe so-called glymphotic washout that's essential.\\n\\nThere's also an adjustment of the neural tissue of the eyes,\\n\\nwhich as many of you have heard me say before,\\n\\nare actually two pieces of brain\\n\\nthat have been extruded from the cranial vault.\\n\\nSo your eyes, yes, indeed are two pieces of brain.\\n\\nThe only two pieces of brain outside the cranial vault.\\n\\nAnd within your eyes, you have neurons and mechanisms\\n\\nthat adjust the sort of sensitivity of your eyes to light\\n\\nand of your brain to light.\\n\\nAnd when you are sleep deprived\\n\\nor when you have a low level viral infection\\n\\nor a cold or a flu of any kind,\\n\\nyou tend to experience light as brighter than it actually is\\n\\nwhen you're rested or you're in the healthy state.\\n\\nSo photophobia is something\\n\\nthat's very, very common in migraine.\\n\\nAnd often the photophobia is a prominent feature\\n\\nof the experience that a migraine is coming on.\\n\\nPeople will start saying,\\n\\noh, you know, it's just too bright in here.\\n\\nAnd normally they'd be able to tolerate\\n\\nthat level of sunlight or of indoor lighting\\n\\nwith no problem.\\n\\nSo there are two aspects of migraine\\n\\nthat I think are particularly important to understand\\n\\nfor sake of the treatment.\\n\\nAnd that's the dilation of vessels.\\n\\nSo if we want to treat migraine,\\n\\nwe're going to have to think about things\\n\\nthat can constrict blood vessels in the brain area.\\n\\nBut we also need to think about photophobia\\n\\nand not photophobia just as a symptom of migraine,\\n\\nbut that maybe by adjusting our sensitivity to light,\\n\\nwe can actually short circuit some of the onset\\n\\nand subsequent pathology of the migraine.\\n\\nThat is if we can prevent photophobia,\\n\\npartially or completely,\\n\\ncan actually offset a lot of the ache of the migraine\\n\\nthat would otherwise occur.\\n\\nSo that's an exciting avenue for addressing migraine headaches.\\n\\nWe'll get into photophobia and how to deal with that.\\n\\nWe'll also talk about aura a little bit more\\n\\nin a few minutes.\\n\\nBut for the time being, we've talked about tension headaches.\\n\\nWe now talked about migraine headaches.\\n\\nAgain, keep in mind knowing what kind of headache you have\\n\\nis essential.\\n\\nIt's, I would say, indispensable\\n\\nfor selecting the best treatment.\\n\\nMany people out there will simply get a headache\\n\\nand decide, oh, I'm going to pop a couple of aspirin.\\n\\nOkay, what does aspirin do?\\n\\nAspirin's an anti-inflammatory.\\n\\nIt also has pronounced effects on the vasodilation\\n\\nand vasoconstriction system.\\n\\nIt actually allows more blood to flow\\n\\nthrough those arteries, vessels, and capillaries.\\n\\nA lot of people actually use baby aspirin\\n\\nor small amounts of aspirin\\n\\nas a way to offset cardiovascular disease.\\n\\nThat's another discussion, but what do we know?\\n\\nWe know that in migraine,\\n\\nthere's a hyper dilation of the blood vessels,\\n\\na hyper dilation of the very little portals\\n\\nthat exist in the brain and around the brain\\n\\nand that are going to cause the pain.\\n\\nThey're going to activate those sensory neurons,\\n\\nthose nosoceptors, that will then give us the experience\\n\\nof extreme headache and migraine.\\n\\nSo taking an aspirin or something like it for migraine,\\n\\nin some cases, the worst possible choice.\\n\\nAgain, so knowing what kind of headache\\n\\nyou are experiencing is going to be essential here.\\n\\nThe other thing that you'll sometimes hear\\n\\nis that drinking a cup of coffee\\n\\nor getting caffeine through tea\\n\\nis a great way to deal with headache.\\n\\nWhy would that be?\\n\\nWell, it turns out that coffee\\n\\ncan cause either vasoconstriction or vasodilation\\n\\ndepending on when you take it.\\n\\nAnd we'll get into the use of caffeine\\n\\nas a treatment for headache\\n\\nbecause indeed it can be a very potent treatment\\n\\nfor headache, but you absolutely need to know\\n\\nwhat kind of headache you are experiencing\\n\\nbecause in some cases, drinking caffeine,\\n\\nwhether it's in tea or coffee,\\n\\ncan absolutely alleviate the pain of a headache,\\n\\nespecially if you catch that onset of a migraine\\n\\nor a tension type headache early on.\\n\\nBut in some cases, it can make it far, far worse.\\n\\nAgain, knowing which type of headache you're experiencing\\n\\nand how the different treatments work is key.\\n\\nOkay, so we have tension type headaches,\\n\\nmigraine type headaches.\\n\\nI think you're starting to get the picture.\\n\\nThey have different underlying biologies.\\n\\nThe next type of headache is cluster headaches.\\n\\nCluster headaches are the ones I mentioned earlier\\n\\nthat arise from deep within the head.\\n\\nThey feel as if they're coming from the inside out\\n\\nand they tend to be on one side or the other.\\n\\nWhat scientists and clinicians call unilateral.\\n\\nIt tends to originate behind the eye\\n\\nand sometimes the nose region,\\n\\nsometimes in the mouth region as well.\\n\\nIt feels kind of patchy,\\n\\nbut as if it's coming from the inside out.\\n\\nAnd again, that's because of that trigeminal nerve\\n\\nfor those of you listening and not watching this on YouTube,\\n\\nI've got three fingers\\n\\nas if I'm putting up three fingers in them.\\n\\nI've got one pointed toward my eye,\\n\\none pointed towards my nose region\\n\\nand one towards my upper lip.\\n\\nThe trigeminal nerve is an easy one to remember\\n\\nand it will completely explain cluster headaches\\n\\nand what to do about cluster headaches in a moment.\\n\\nIf you remember that the herpes one virus,\\n\\nand not herpes two, not genital herpes,\\n\\nbut herpes one virus is the one\\n\\nthat gives cold sores on the mouth.\\n\\nHerpes one virus by the way is exceedingly common\\n\\nup to 90% of people, many children in fact have these.\\n\\nAgain, this is not a sexually transmitted herpes,\\n\\nalthough it can be of course transmitted\\n\\nthrough kissing and sexual contact,\\n\\nbut that's not the only origin of it.\\n\\nOkay, it can be passed by skin contact and mucosal contact.\\n\\nSo mucosal mucosal, so that would be kissing,\\n\\nmucosal lining or even skin to mucosal lining.\\n\\nSo that's why it's so common.\\n\\nAnd the reason why cold sores develop on the mouth\\n\\nfor people that have herpes one\\n\\nis because the virus actually lives on the trigeminal nerve.\\n\\nAnd yes, it is true that sometimes the virus\\n\\nwill inflame the nerve and the inflammation will occur\\n\\nat the level of the eye.\\n\\nSo people do unfortunately sometimes get herpes of the eye.\\n\\nIt actually can be quite dangerous.\\n\\nIf you have an infection of the eye,\\n\\nherpes infection of the eye,\\n\\nyou should see an ophthalmologist or the nose region.\\n\\nThey can experience pain\\n\\nin the mucosal tissue of the nose.\\n\\nMore often than not, the most inflammation is occurring\\n\\non the branch that innervates the lip\\n\\nor the region close to the lip.\\n\\nAnd that's why a cold sore develops there,\\n\\nan immune response there,\\n\\nsignaling that there's inflammation\\n\\ndue to the herpes virus,\\n\\nwhich lives on that neuron for a very long time.\\n\\nNeurons don't turn over in the lifespan,\\n\\nso it can live on there for the extent of the person's life.\\n\\nHowever, most people hopefully treat their HSV-1,\\n\\nbut if they don't, the sort of frequency\\n\\nand the severity of infections\\n\\ntends to taper off with time.\\n\\nWe'll have an entire discussion about viruses\\n\\nand herpes in particular in a future episode.\\n\\nBut the thing to keep in mind here is that this very nerve\\n\\nis the one that gets inflamed in these cluster type headaches.\\n\\nNow cluster type headaches are associated\\n\\nwith a bunch of very uncomfortable symptoms.\\n\\nAgain, they tend to be unilateral,\\n\\nthey tend to begin very deep,\\n\\nand they tend to be excruciatingly painful,\\n\\nexcruciatingly painful.\\n\\nThey can last anywhere from 30 minutes to three hours.\\n\\nSome people experience these in sleep.\\n\\nIn fact, this is one of the cases\\n\\nwhere men experience a headache more than females.\\n\\nMen experience cluster type headaches\\n\\nthat have a sudden onset during sleep\\n\\nat five times the frequency than do females.\\n\\nThe origins of that aren't exactly clear.\\n\\nThey do seem to have something to do\\n\\nwith the biological clock mechanisms,\\n\\nthe so-called circadian mechanisms.\\n\\nSo if you are a man or woman for that matter,\\n\\nand you're waking up in the middle of the night\\n\\nwith a unilateral headache,\\n\\nand it seems like it's deep within your head\\n\\nor it's starting there and it's on one side\\n\\nand localized to the eye,\\n\\nand maybe these other regions the trigeminal is involved in,\\n\\nyou may be suffering from cluster type headache\\n\\nand you should talk to your physician.\\n\\nThe other symptom that's quite common\\n\\nin cluster type headache is a droopy eyelid,\\n\\nwhich should make sense\\n\\nbecause the trigeminal innervates the eye region,\\n\\nand there are other nerves that control the eyelid,\\n\\nbut they're in that general region and they can be impacted.\\n\\nThe other thing is something called meiosis,\\n\\nwhich is that you can't dilate the pupil.\\n\\nI mentioned this before,\\n\\nso those your pupils might get really, really small\\n\\nand they won't dilate.\\n\\nAnd the other thing is lacrimation, tearing,\\n\\nand then nasal discharge,\\n\\nall because of a neural inflammation problem.\\n\\nWhy do I tell you with such detail about cluster headaches?\\n\\nWell, if you are somebody\\n\\nthat's experiencing the kind of pain\\n\\nthat is consistent with cluster headache,\\n\\ntaking a standard anti-inflammatory\\n\\nor doing something that is going to adjust the violation\\n\\nor constriction of blood vessels\\n\\nmay have an indirect impact on cluster headache,\\n\\nbut is unlikely to relieve cluster headache,\\n\\neither acutely, meaning right away,\\n\\nor in preventing cluster headaches.\\n\\nYou have to deal with this as a neural issue.\\n\\nAnd we'll talk about some of the main causes of inflammation\\n\\nand activation of these cluster type headaches\\n\\nat the level of the trigeminal nerve in a little bit,\\n\\nbecause fortunately there are some excellent treatments.\\n\\nThe next type of headache that is quite common\\n\\nare hormonal headaches.\\n\\nNow, the phrase hormonal headache\\n\\nshould already cue you to the fact\\n\\nthat it's far too general a term,\\n\\nbecause there are so many different hormones,\\n\\ntestosterone, estrogen, thyroid hormone, growth hormone,\\n\\nand on and on and on,\\n\\nand they all have many different functions\\n\\nin the brain and body.\\n\\nEvery single hormone,\\n\\nand in particular, the so-called steroid hormones.\\n\\nSteroids, again, not just limited to things\\n\\nthat people take for sports.\\n\\nIn fact, the steroid hormones refers to estrogen,\\n\\ntestosterone of the sort that we all make,\\n\\nthat men and women make naturally.\\n\\nAnd those steroid hormones can impact gene expression.\\n\\nThey can, are of course,\\n\\nwhat turns on the growth of the breast tissue,\\n\\nof the testicular tissue, of hair growth and on and on.\\n\\nAnd that's all because of gene expression.\\n\\nIf you're really going to change the identity\\n\\nand function of a cell long-term, right?\\n\\nYou're going to literally change the breast tissue\\n\\nor change the penile tissue or change the ovarian tissue\\n\\nin some sort of consistent way across the lifespan,\\n\\nyou can bet that there are changes in gene expression.\\n\\nAnd those changes in gene expression occur\\n\\nbecause the steroid hormones have this incredible ability,\\n\\nsort of like the X-Men of hormones,\\n\\nto pass through the outer membrane of a cell,\\n\\nwhich we call the extracellular membrane,\\n\\nand into the so-called nuclear membrane.\\n\\nThey can go into the area where genes are made\\n\\nand turn on and off different genes.\\n\\nHowever, they multitask in their life.\\n\\nThat is, these steroid hormones,\\n\\nlike estrogen in particular and testosterone in particular,\\n\\ncan also bind to the surface of cells\\n\\nand impact all sorts of things at the level of the cells\\n\\nthat have nothing to do with changes in gene expression.\\n\\nAnd that second mechanism of binding\\n\\nto the surface of cells is one of the ways\\n\\nin which estrogen can control different aspects of headache.\\n\\nNow, that doesn't necessarily mean\\n\\nthat estrogen gives you headaches.\\n\\nIn fact, it's just the opposite.\\n\\nIt turns out that low estrogen and another hormone,\\n\\nlow progesterone, combine to give rise to headache\\n\\nbecause of the ways that low estrogen and low progesterone\\n\\nimpact vasodilation and vasoconstriction\\n\\nand the inflammatory response.\\n\\nWe'll talk about how to deal with hormone-based headaches,\\n\\nin particular, hormone-based headaches\\n\\nthat occur because of low estrogen\\n\\nand progesterone in a moment.\\n\\nBut the key thing to know is something\\n\\nthat we covered in the fertility episode.\\n\\nI did a very long, very detailed episode on fertility,\\n\\nso I'm not going to go into this in significant detail now.\\n\\nYou can refer to that episode\\n\\nfor probably more detail than you ever wanted,\\n\\nbut also a lot of tools as it relates to fertility\\n\\nin both males and females.\\n\\nBut right now, I'm just going to give you\\n\\na course overview of that in about 60 to 120 seconds\\n\\nso that you'll understand when hormonal headaches\\n\\nare most likely to take place.\\n\\nKeep in mind that hormonal headaches\\n\\nare most likely to take place\\n\\nwhen estrogen and progesterone are lowest.\\n\\nSo if you understand that during the follicular stage\\n\\nof the ovulatory slash menstrual cycle,\\n\\nso menstrual cycle is about 28 days on average,\\n\\nnot in everyone, but it's about 28 days on average,\\n\\nand the first half of that,\\n\\nestrogen starts creeping up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up,\\n\\nand as we learn in endocrinology,\\n\\nestrogen primes progesterone,\\n\\nso estrogen will then peak and then start to fall,\\n\\nlow, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low,\\n\\npretty quickly, right about the time that the egg ovulates.\\n\\nAn egg is released and will essentially be ready\\n\\nfor fertilization if the egg is fertilized.\\n\\nA whole bunch of other things happen\\n\\nas it relates to pregnancy.\\n\\nIf not, what ends up happening is that\\n\\nduring the luteal phase,\\n\\nwhich is the second half of the menstrual cycle,\\n\\nthere's been a buildup of the lining of the uterus\\n\\nbecause of an increase in progesterone.\\n\\nSo estrogen goes up during the follicular phase,\\n\\nthen it goes down, and then progesterone goes up, up, up,\\n\\nup, up, which is important for generating\\n\\nthat thick lining of the uterus to allow the fertilized egg\\n\\nif it's fertilized to implant, and if it's not fertilized,\\n\\nall of that gets released from the body\\n\\nin this bleeding process that we call menstruation.\\n\\nIf menstruation occurs and day one of the menstrual cycle\\n\\nis considered the first day in which bleeding occurs,\\n\\nwell, then what that means is that estrogen is already low\\n\\nbecause remember, estrogen was low\\n\\nat the start of the follicular phase\\n\\nand went up, up, up, up, up, up,\\n\\nthen it comes down right at the time of ovulation,\\n\\nand progesterone goes up, up, up, up, up\\n\\nduring the luteal phase.\\n\\nIn fact, it's more than a thousand-fold increase\\n\\nin progesterone, but if there's no fertilization of the egg,\\n\\nprogesterone starts coming down, down, down, down, down.\\n\\nWhat does that mean?\\n\\nThat means that on the first to about the fourth\\n\\nor fifth day of the menstrual cycle,\\n\\nfirst being the first day of bleeding\\n\\nuntil about the fourth or fifth day of the menstrual cycle,\\n\\nboth estrogen and progesterone are very, very low.\\n\\nAnd it is at that time,\\n\\nat the very beginning of the menstrual cycle,\\n\\nso about the first week of the menstrual cycle,\\n\\nthat many women are very prone to hormonal headaches.\\n\\nHormonal headaches, not because estrogen's high,\\n\\nthat's a common misconception,\\n\\nrather because estrogen and progesterone are both low.\\n\\nAnd now that you understand the contour\\n\\nor the underlying reasons for hormonal headache,\\n\\nyou can start to ask, well,\\n\\nwhat happens when estrogen is low?\\n\\nWell, estrogen has a strong impact\\n\\non the vasodilation, vasoconstriction system,\\n\\nas does progesterone.\\n\\nWe'll talk about that a little bit later,\\n\\nbut now that you know what hormonal headache is,\\n\\nat least this one particular type of hormonal headache,\\n\\nwhich is very, very common,\\n\\ngiven the number of women that are menstruating,\\n\\nand the fact that low estrogen, low progesterone\\n\\nis the cause of the hormonal headache,\\n\\nand the fact that, of course,\\n\\nthere are women who are no longer menstruating,\\n\\nso they're either in perimenopause\\n\\nand menstruation is becoming more infrequent,\\n\\nor they're in menopause and it has ceased entirely.\\n\\nWell, now you understand what the origin\\n\\nof the hormonal headache is,\\n\\nand so all we need to know is,\\n\\nwhat do estrogen and progesterone normally do\\n\\nin order to prevent headache?\\n\\nAnd thereby, you'll know exactly how to offset,\\n\\nthat is, prevent or treat hormonal headache\\n\\nin that first week of the menstrual period.\\n\\nThe last type of headache that I'd like to discuss\\n\\nis headache associated with head hits,\\n\\nthat is, traumatic brain injury,\\n\\nalthough I definitely want to underscore the fact\\n\\nthat even people who do not have traumatic brain injury\\n\\ncan experience headaches\\n\\nas the consequence of hitting their head.\\n\\nSo the line between traumatic brain injury\\n\\nand lower level brain injury\\n\\nis one that still seeks definition,\\n\\nand in fact, this is one of the major goals\\n\\nof the clinical field as it relates to concussion.\\n\\nIt's also what comes up a lot\\n\\nduring the discussion about football.\\n\\nThese days, you'll see players hit really hard,\\n\\nand depending on whether or not they're laying there\\n\\nfor five seconds, 30 seconds, or three minutes,\\n\\nthe crowd and the people watching on television\\n\\nand everywhere else are all speculating\\n\\nas to whether or not the person should be allowed to play,\\n\\nand to be quite direct,\\n\\nthere really is no way to assess the extent of brain damage\\n\\nafter the consequence of hitting one's head\\n\\nor having one's head hit,\\n\\nbecause first of all, almost all of the best ways\\n\\nto detect traumatic brain injury,\\n\\nexcept the most severe ones,\\n\\ntend to require a lot of very large equipment\\n\\nlike MRI and functional MRI and CT scans,\\n\\nnone of which are available on the side of the field\\n\\nor in the locker room,\\n\\nbut also because many, many, if not most of the effects\\n\\nof traumatic brain injury are going to occur\\n\\nnot in the immediate minutes or even hours after the injury,\\n\\nbut several hours, days, or even weeks after that injury.\\n\\nSo this is a discussion that we should hold off\\n\\nfor a longer full episode on traumatic brain injury,\\n\\nkeeping in mind, of course,\\n\\nthat football is this very salient example\\n\\nof traumatic brain injury and concussion,\\n\\nas is boxing, as is even soccer with heading of the ball,\\n\\nbelieve it or not, repeated low level impact to the forehead\\n\\nand other parts of the head can give rise to over time,\\n\\ntraumatic brain injury without the need\\n\\nfor any kind of full-blown concussion\\n\\nor being quote unquote knocked out,\\n\\nbut sports related concussion actually occupies\\n\\njust a tiny fraction of the majority\\n\\nof traumatic brain injury and concussion.\\n\\nMost traumatic brain injury and concussion\\n\\nand low level brain injury that can accumulate over time\\n\\nto become traumatic for sake of daily living,\\n\\nthat is lowered cognition, disruption in mood,\\n\\nsleep, et cetera, is actually the consequence\\n\\nof things other than sports.\\n\\nSo for instance, bicycle accidents,\\n\\nplayground accidents, construction accidents,\\n\\nand this is often forgotten.\\n\\nFor some reason, all the sports and in particular football\\n\\ntend to grab all the attention as it relates to concussion.\\n\\nKeep in mind that, well, for certain people\\n\\nis a path to a living.\\n\\nFor most people, traumatic brain injury\\n\\nis going to occur in a car accident, construction work\\n\\nor other types of work for which people generally\\n\\ndon't have many options in terms of the type of work\\n\\nthat they're doing.\\n\\nSo they are prone to concussions and head injuries\\n\\nsimply by virtue of their work\\n\\nwithout any millions of dollars contracts\\n\\nor the opportunity to necessarily,\\n\\nin some cases they do, but necessarily to do other things\\n\\nand certainly car accidents or bicycle accidents\\n\\nare not voluntary events.\\n\\nSo the point being traumatic brain injury\\n\\nand headache related traumatic brain injury\\n\\nextends far beyond the realm of sports.\\n\\nAnd in fact, if you were to look at the numbers,\\n\\nwhat you find is that more than 90%\\n\\nof traumatic brain injury,\\n\\nso people coming into the hospital or clinic\\n\\nor people claiming that they've got consistent headaches,\\n\\nthey're not sleeping well, their mood is off,\\n\\nthey're feeling more irritable\\n\\nafter having hit their head even once,\\n\\nis not the consequence of sports,\\n\\nit's going to be the consequence of accidents\\n\\neither at the workplace or in terms of a bicycle\\n\\nor other sorts of transportation based accident\\n\\nlike a car accident.\\n\\nWith that in mind, any kind of head hit,\\n\\ncertainly if it involves a concussion\\n\\nor traumatic brain injury often leads to headaches,\\n\\neither infrequent but severe headaches\\n\\nor chronic low-level headaches\\n\\nor a feeling that there's kind of a stuffiness\\n\\nor a fullness to the head.\\n\\nThere can be a lot of different origins to that.\\n\\nA common origin is going to be actual swelling\\n\\nof the, not necessarily the brain tissue directly,\\n\\nbut if you recall our discussion about the meninges,\\n\\nwhich include the dura and the other tissues\\n\\nthat surround the brain,\\n\\nthey're actually three layers that we call the meninges,\\n\\nthe dura just being one of them.\\n\\nAnd there's a very little space between those,\\n\\nthe brain, the meninges that surround it and the skull,\\n\\nand it's called the subarachnoid space, very cool,\\n\\nright, arachnoid like spider.\\n\\nWell, if there's even a slight bit of swelling in the brain\\n\\nor even distant brain tissue,\\n\\nso for instance, even if there's whiplash,\\n\\nso there's swelling of the tissue, muscular tissue\\n\\nand neural tissue in the neck area,\\n\\nthat can constrict the flow of things\\n\\nlike cerebral spinal fluid, blood flow,\\n\\nand indeed mucus and other things that are essential.\\n\\nWe all hear mucus and we think illness,\\n\\nbut mucus is a vital, vital substance within the body\\n\\nfor a lot of important reasons,\\n\\nin health as well as in sickness.\\n\\nWell, if there's less of that liquid and other fluids\\n\\nand mucus being delivered to that space,\\n\\nwell, then it can clog up,\\n\\nso sort of the plumbing is clogged up\\n\\nor that it's caught at the level of the site of hit\\n\\nor injury because there's some local swelling\\n\\nand inflammation there.\\n\\nSo there are many different mechanisms\\n\\nthat can underlie headache associated\\n\\nwith head hits or traumatic brain injury.\\n\\nNow, fortunately, there's some recent data pointing to\\n\\nsome, what I would call non-obvious treatments\\n\\nfor headache in traumatic brain injury,\\n\\nkeeping in mind that anytime we're talking about injury\\n\\nor disease or health for that matter,\\n\\nmental health or physical health,\\n\\nwe have to highlight a fact that's going to come up\\n\\nagain and again in every single episode of this podcast.\\n\\nAnd I think it's not being overly redundant to do so,\\n\\nwhich is that regular sufficient amounts\\n\\nof deep sleep each night are going to be important\\n\\nfor all aspects of mental health, physical health,\\n\\nand performance and have been shown over and over again\\n\\nto reduce the frequency of headache\\n\\nand to reduce the time to repair\\n\\nafter traumatic brain injury\\n\\nand can improve cognition and on and on and on.\\n\\nSo sleep is essential for all the normal things\\n\\nthat encourage healthy activity of the different tissues\\n\\nthat are involved in brain and body to occur.\\n\\nSo sleep deprivation, of course, is going to limit those.\\n\\nBut I do want to point out that sleep, sunlight,\\n\\nand I've talked about this almost ad nauseum on this podcast,\\n\\nbut regular circadian cycles getting sunlight\\n\\nin your eyes early in the day and in the evening as well\\n\\nand as much as possible throughout the day\\n\\nwithout burning your skin and limiting your exposure\\n\\nto artificial lights at night and on and on,\\n\\nall of which is covered in the Light for Health episode\\n\\nof the Huberman Lab podcast,\\n\\nthe Master Your Sleep episode of the Huberman Lab podcast,\\n\\nand in the Perfect Your Sleep episode\\n\\nof the Huberman Lab podcast.\\n\\nYou can find all that at hubermanlab.com.\\n\\nGetting light and avoiding light\\n\\nat the proper times of the 24-hour cycle\\n\\nis also going to favor all the pathways\\n\\nranging from gut brain access to the inflammatory,\\n\\nanti-inflammatory pathways, neural pathways, et cetera,\\n\\nthat, of course, if you do that,\\n\\nyou're going to improve and offset any kind of detriment\\n\\ncaused by traumatic brain injury.\\n\\nIs it treating traumatic brain injury directly?\\n\\nNo, but is not getting sufficient sleep,\\n\\nnot getting sunlight at the right times of day\\n\\nand getting too much artificial light at night\\n\\ngoing to make any impact of traumatic brain injury,\\n\\nincluding headache, far worse?\\n\\nYes, there are certainly a ton of data\\n\\nto support that statement as well.\\n\\nAnd then, of course,\\n\\nnutrition and exercise are also important.\\n\\nSo we can list out sleep, sun, proper nutrition, exercise,\\n\\nand I would put proper social connection,\\n\\nwhatever that means to you, healthy social connections,\\n\\ninclude romantic, friendship, familial,\\n\\nand relationship to self.\\n\\nThose five things, sleep, exercise, sun, nutrition,\\n\\nand social connection are all critical\\n\\nfor maintaining baselines of health\\n\\nand raising your baselines of health.\\n\\nAnd I mentioned that, I kind of segment this out now\\n\\nbecause I think that anytime we're about to start\\n\\ndiscussing pointed treatments,\\n\\nthat is things that you can take or do to reduce headache\\n\\nor things that you can take or do to improve anything\\n\\nwithin mental health, physical health, and performance,\\n\\nwe have to remember that the foundation of mental health,\\n\\nphysical health, and performance is only set\\n\\nat its highest level by tending to those other things\\n\\nand that nothing really surpasses any of those things.\\n\\nOr put differently, there's no replacement\\n\\nfor any of those things in the form of a pill,\\n\\na powder, even a behavioral practice.\\n\\nThere are things you can do to offset\\n\\ngetting less than ideal sleep.\\n\\nThere are things that you can use\\n\\nlike bright artificial lights during the day\\n\\nto try and partially offset lack of sunlight,\\n\\nbut really there is no exercise pill.\\n\\nThere is no sunlight device,\\n\\nalthough some bright lights are very bright.\\n\\nThere's no replacement for actual sunlight.\\n\\nThere's no replacement for actual sleep.\\n\\nThere's no replacement for actual nutrition.\\n\\nAnd I do feel it's an important conversation to have\\n\\nas we head into the next segment,\\n\\nwhich is what can you take or do to reduce headache?\\n\\nAnd in order to address this,\\n\\nwe're going to start first with the headaches associated\\n\\nwith head hits and traumatic brain injury,\\n\\nbecause it turns out there's a surprising\\n\\nand very useful approach to doing that.\\n\\nBut this same approach also can help offset\\n\\nand treat headache in other conditions as well,\\n\\nmeaning not just for headaches caused\\n\\nby traumatic brain injury,\\n\\nbut also headaches caused by sudden onset tension headache\\n\\nor migraine headache, or even perhaps,\\n\\nagain, perhaps cluster type headaches.\\n\\nSo the first substance that I'd like to highlight\\n\\nthat has been shown to significantly reduce the intensity\\n\\nand or frequency of headaches is creatine.\\n\\nNow, creatine, as many of you know,\\n\\nis something that people supplement and take.\\n\\nMost often, creatine is discussed\\n\\nin the context of muscle performance,\\n\\nnot just for people who weight lift,\\n\\nbut for people who do endurance exercise.\\n\\nAnd it's often been said that five to 10 grams per day\\n\\nof creatine monohydrate, depending on how much you weigh,\\n\\nfive to 10 grams per day of creatine monohydrate\\n\\ncan increase creatine phosphate stores in muscles,\\n\\ncan bring more water into muscles,\\n\\ncan make you stronger, get increased power output.\\n\\nAnd that is all true.\\n\\nThat is all completely true.\\n\\nWe discussed this in the Huberman Lab podcast\\n\\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin when he was a guest\\n\\non the Huberman Lab podcast or standard series.\\n\\nAnd we discussed this extensively in an upcoming episode\\n\\nfrom Dr. Andy Galpin in his special six-part guest series\\n\\nwhere he is a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast,\\n\\nbut where really he's the one doing the majority\\n\\nof the teaching.\\n\\nThat series covers everything\\n\\nfrom strength, hypertrophy, endurance,\\n\\nand there's an episode on supplementation\\n\\nwhere we go deep into the discussion about creatine.\\n\\nNow in that discussion, and again now,\\n\\nwe highlight the fact that creatine,\\n\\nwhile most often discussed online and in the media\\n\\nas a supplement for sports performance,\\n\\nfor the reasons I just mentioned,\\n\\nactually has far more data behind it,\\n\\nthat is laboratory studies,\\n\\nexploring the role of creatine in the clinical setting.\\n\\nSo I'd like to highlight a paper from that literature now\\n\\nthat will make very clear as to why creatine is interesting\\n\\nand in fact, very effective for treating headache\\n\\nand particular headache caused by head hits\\n\\nor traumatic brain injury.\\n\\nThe title of the paper is prevention of traumatic headache,\\n\\ndizziness and fatigue with creatine administration.\\n\\nNow keep in mind, this is a pilot study.\\n\\nIt was performed in humans.\\n\\nSo when you hear the words preclinical,\\n\\nthat is if you hear there was a preclinical study on blank,\\n\\nthat means almost always that the study was performed\\n\\non animal models, mice, rats, primates, et cetera.\\n\\nA clinical trial is something that's carried out on humans\\n\\nand a pilot study means that the study was carried out\\n\\non humans, but on a fairly small cohort,\\n\\na fairly small group or limited number of subjects.\\n\\nNonetheless, if the data are robust\\n\\nas it is in this case of this paper,\\n\\nI think it's worth paying attention to.\\n\\nSo in this study,\\n\\nwhat they looked at was creatine administration.\\n\\nSo what they did is they had people ingest\\n\\na certain amount of creatine, I'll tell you in a moment,\\n\\nin fluid so it could be taken in water or milk\\n\\nwith or without food.\\n\\nIt doesn't really matter what time of day.\\n\\nThey had people take creatine.\\n\\nWhy would they have people take creatine\\n\\nafter traumatic brain injury?\\n\\nAnd in particular for people that are suffering\\n\\nfrom headache, dizziness, fatigue, et cetera.\\n\\nThe reason is that neurons, nerve cells,\\n\\nrely very heavily on the regulation of calcium\\n\\nin order to generate those action potentials\\n\\nto communicate with one another.\\n\\nSo it doesn't matter if it's a motor neuron,\\n\\na sensory neuron or a modulatory neuron,\\n\\nthey all generate action potentials\\n\\nor something similar to it.\\n\\nAnd calcium is important for that process.\\n\\nCalcium becomes dysregulated after traumatic brain injury\\n\\nin a number of different ways,\\n\\nin particular in ways that impact\\n\\nthe energy production systems of cells\\n\\nthat are related to ATP, adenosine triphosphate\\n\\nfor those aficionados out there that want to look it up.\\n\\nYou can simply look up calcium, ATP and neurons\\n\\nand you can learn about that cycle.\\n\\nCreatine can be stored in muscles\\n\\nas we talked about before,\\n\\nbut creatine and in particular\\n\\nthe phosphorylated form of creatine,\\n\\nwhich is the readily available fuel source form of creatine\\n\\ncan also be stored in brain tissue\\n\\nand is actually quite prominently stored in the forebrain,\\n\\nthe area where the real estate of your brain\\n\\njust behind the forehead,\\n\\nwhich is involved in planning and action\\n\\nand understanding context.\\n\\nSo it's very important for cognition.\\n\\nIt's important for personality too,\\n\\nbut it's important for a number of different aspects of life\\n\\nthat have to do with making plans,\\n\\nbeing able to focus very intensely on your work, et cetera,\\n\\nor on anything for that matter.\\n\\nAll functions that become heavily disrupted\\n\\nin people who have traumatic brain injury and concussion.\\n\\nCreatine's ability to communicate\\n\\nwith the calcium and the ATP system\\n\\nwas the motivation behind the study.\\n\\nThat is the authors hypothesized\\n\\non the basis of preclinical data in animals\\n\\nthat by increasing creatine stores within the brain,\\n\\nnot just in the muscle, but in particular within the brain\\n\\nthat the availability of creatine would allow\\n\\nfor better cognitive function in general.\\n\\nNow they didn't look at cognition\\n\\nspecifically in this paper,\\n\\nbut they did look at the other aspects,\\n\\nthat is the bad stuff associated with TBI.\\n\\nAnd they had people supplement with creatine\\n\\nat a level that is much higher than the typical level\\n\\nthat people supplement with creatine\\n\\nsimply for sports performance.\\n\\nSo as I mentioned before,\\n\\nmost people, if they supplement with creatine\\n\\nfor sports performance, they take creatine monohydrate,\\n\\ntypically five grams per day,\\n\\nsometimes 10 grams per day,\\n\\nif they're about a hundred kilograms\\n\\nor greater in body weight.\\n\\n100 kilograms is approximately 220 pounds.\\n\\nSo the dosage that was used for implementing creatine\\n\\nin this study to address the potential impact of creatine\\n\\non headache, dizziness, and fatigue\\n\\nwas quite a bit higher than the dosages used\\n\\nsimply for muscle performance.\\n\\nIn this study, they had people take a dose of 0.4 grams\\n\\nof creatine monohydrate per kilogram of body weight.\\n\\nSo for somebody that weighs a hundred kilograms\\n\\nor 220 pounds, that would be 40 grams of creatine per day.\\n\\nIf someone weighs half that much,\\n\\nthey would take 20 grams of creatine per day.\\n\\nAnd they did that over a period of six months.\\n\\nAnd we know that when you take creatine over and over\\n\\nday to day, that there's a buildup of creatine stores\\n\\nboth in the muscles and within the brain tissue.\\n\\nNow, what they found as a consequence\\n\\nof this creatine administration was really striking\\n\\nand I think quite exciting.\\n\\nThey found a very significant decrease\\n\\nin the frequency of headache\\n\\nin people that were supplementing with creatine\\n\\nas opposed to the controls.\\n\\nNow, keep in mind that this is a pilot study\\n\\nbut the effects are very dramatic.\\n\\nThey found a very statistically significant decrease\\n\\nin the frequency of headache\\n\\nin people that were taking creatine.\\n\\nIn fact, if you look at the controls\\n\\nand you see that they're basically getting headache\\n\\nat a frequency of 90% or more after TBI,\\n\\nthe reduction in headache frequency\\n\\nis down to about 10 or 12% in the people taking creatine.\\n\\nSo that's quite a dramatic effect.\\n\\nAnd if you look at the other measures they took,\\n\\nkeep in mind again, this is a pilot study,\\n\\nso a limited number of subjects,\\n\\nbut again, the results are very impressive.\\n\\nWhat they found is that the number of people\\n\\nexperiencing dizziness was significantly reduced\\n\\nin people supplementing with creatine\\n\\nas was the number of people experiencing fatigue,\\n\\nkind of acute fatigue and chronic fatigue.\\n\\nAgain, not chronic fatigue syndrome per se,\\n\\nbut chronic fatigue, which was in this study defined\\n\\nas a general sense of bodily weakness\\n\\nand even mental weakness.\\n\\nMental weakness is a little bit hard to quantify,\\n\\nbut they were very careful to distinguish\\n\\nbetween cognitive and mental fatigue\\n\\nversus physical and somatic fatigue.\\n\\nThey acknowledged that both of those occur in TBI or post-TBI.\\n\\nThe headache is quite frequent.\\n\\nBasically, the takeaway of this study\\n\\nis that for people experiencing headache,\\n\\ndizziness and fatigue due to TBI and perhaps,\\n\\nand I want to underline perhaps\\n\\nbecause it hasn't really been explored yet,\\n\\nbut perhaps headache, dizziness and fatigue\\n\\ndue to other conditions, symptoms or causes of headache,\\n\\ncreatine monohydrate supplementation might be,\\n\\nagain, might be an excellent candidate for people to try.\\n\\nWhy do we say that?\\n\\nWell, first of all,\\n\\ncreatine monohydrate is relatively inexpensive.\\n\\nIt's considered safe at the dosages used in this study\\n\\nand certainly for sports performance as well.\\n\\nAnd there are very few other compounds\\n\\nthat have been shown to have as significant an impact\\n\\non headache over the long-term\\n\\nas has creatine monohydrate\\n\\nin these studies of people with TBI.\\n\\nIt's also important to highlight the fact that\\n\\nmany, many people suffer from TBI as I mentioned earlier,\\n\\nand as now there are very few treatments for TBI.\\n\\nYou tend to get the basic advice coming back\\n\\nand again, I think it's excellent advice,\\n\\nget proper amounts of sleep,\\n\\nget exercise, but don't get another traumatic brain injury.\\n\\nThat's obvious, but you'd be surprised\\n\\nhow many people go right back to work because they have to.\\n\\nAnd we have to be sympathetic to the fact\\n\\nthat many people just can't stop working\\n\\nor go on disability.\\n\\nSo many people have to go back to work.\\n\\nThat could be sport or it could be other kind of work\\n\\nwhere they are then subject to perhaps getting more TBI.\\n\\nMaybe they're getting less rest as a consequence and stress.\\n\\nObviously stress is a confounding issue for TBI,\\n\\nbut sleep, exercise, sun, nutrition, all of those things,\\n\\nproper social connection are what people are encouraged\\n\\nto do when they have TBI,\\n\\nbut there have been very few compounds in particular,\\n\\nvery few over-the-counter compounds that are known to be safe\\n\\nthat have shown efficacy in dealing with TBI.\\n\\nSo I think that while this is a pilot study\\n\\nand we can consider it preliminary,\\n\\nI think it's important enough\\n\\nand the effects were dramatic enough\\n\\nthat people with headache and in particular people with TBI\\n\\nought to consider supplementing with creatine\\n\\nin order to deal with their headaches.\\n\\nAnd of course I eagerly await other studies\\n\\nexploring the role of this high dosage of creatine\\n\\nor she's a relatively high dosage of creatine monohydrate\\n\\nfor offsetting headache.\\n\\nMeanwhile, I think there are a number of people out there\\n\\nsuffering from headache\\n\\nwho might consider using creatine monohydrate\\n\\nin an exploratory fashion\\n\\nand seeing whether it helps offset their headaches.\\n\\nKeep in mind, of course,\\n\\nanytime you're going to add or remove anything,\\n\\na supplement or otherwise from your treatment,\\n\\nyour nutrition, et cetera,\\n\\nI do suggest that you consult with your physician\\n\\nin particular if you have chronic headaches.\\n\\nI don't say that to protect me,\\n\\nI say that of course to protect you.\\n\\nI'd like to take a brief break\\n\\nand thank our sponsor InsideTracker.\\n\\nInsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform\\n\\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\\n\\nto help you better understand your body\\n\\nand help you reach your health goals.\\n\\nI've long been a believer\\n\\nin getting regular blood work done\\n\\nfor the simple reason that many of the factors\\n\\nthat impact your immediate and long-term health\\n\\ncan only be analyzed from a quality blood test.\\n\\nThe problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,\\n\\nhowever, is that you get data back about metabolic factors,\\n\\nlipids and hormones and so forth,\\n\\nbut you don't know what to do with those data.\\n\\nInsideTracker solves that problem\\n\\nand makes it very easy for you to understand\\n\\nwhat sorts of nutritional, behavioral,\\n\\nmaybe even supplementation-based interventions\\n\\nyou might want to take on\\n\\nin order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors,\\n\\nhormones, lipids and other things\\n\\nthat impact your immediate and long-term health\\n\\nto bring those numbers into the ranges\\n\\nthat are appropriate and indeed optimal for you.\\n\\nInsideTracker's ultimate plan\\n\\nalso now includes a measure of apolipoprotein B.\\n\\nApolipoprotein B, sometimes also called APO-B,\\n\\nhas emerged in recent years\\n\\nas among the most important measures\\n\\nto evaluate your overall levels of cardiovascular health\\n\\nand health overall.\\n\\nAnd that's because apolipoprotein B levels\\n\\nare predictive of cardiovascular

exciting.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nWell, what I'm about to describe is a compound\\n\\nor I should say a set of compounds\\n\\nthat are available over the counter,\\n\\nthat have been shown to be very effective\\n\\nin reducing the frequency and intensity of headaches.\\n\\nAnd not just one kind of headache,\\n\\nbut multiple types of headaches.\\n\\nSo what I'll describe has been shown\\n\\nto have significant effects in reducing the intensity\\n\\nor frequency of tension type headaches,\\n\\nmigraine type headaches, as well as hormone type headaches\\n\\nthat are related to the menstrual cycles\\n\\nthat I described earlier.\\n\\nNow, there are a lot of data centered\\n\\naround this general topic,\\n\\nbut I'm going to focus on three main papers.\\n\\nWhat I haven't told you yet, of course,\\n\\nis what is the compound that I'm referring to?\\n\\nWhat is this over-the-counter compound?\\n\\nWell, it turns out this over-the-counter compound\\n\\nis not just available over the counter,\\n\\nit's also available in food.\\n\\nSo it turns out that nutrition can have a very strong impact\\n\\non the frequency and intensity of headache,\\n\\nalthough supplementation with this particular compound\\n\\ncan accomplish the same thing as well.\\n\\nWhat I'm referring to here are omega-3 fatty acids.\\n\\nMany of you are probably familiar\\n\\nwith omega-3 fatty acids.\\n\\nThese are fatty acids that come in the form\\n\\nof so-called EPA and DHA,\\n\\nand omega-3 fatty acids are commonly distinguished\\n\\nfrom the so-called omega-6 fatty acids.\\n\\nOmega-6 fatty acids come in a bunch of different foods,\\n\\nand they, of course, can be supplemented as well.\\n\\nOmega-3 fatty acids come in a bunch of different foods\\n\\nand can be supplemented as well.\\n\\nCommon forms of omega-3 fatty acids,\\n\\nor I should say common sources\\n\\nof omega-3 fatty acids in foods include fatty ocean fish,\\n\\nincluding salmon, salmon skins, sardines, anchovies,\\n\\nthings of that sort.\\n\\nCommon sources in supplement form\\n\\nare so-called fish oil capsules or liquid fish oil.\\n\\nAgain, omega-3 fatty acids,\\n\\nand almost always when we're talking\\n\\nabout omega-3 fatty acids,\\n\\nwe're talking about a combination of EPA and DHA,\\n\\nbut really it is the quantity of EPA omega-3 fatty acids\\n\\nthat seems to be the most impactful\\n\\nfor the sorts of health metrics\\n\\nthat we're going to talk about in a few minutes.\\n\\nNow, with respect to omega-6 fatty acids,\\n\\nthe most typical food sources\\n\\nof omega-6 fatty acids are seed oils.\\n\\nI know nowadays seed oils have become quite controversial.\\n\\nI've given my stance on this in a prior podcast,\\n\\nbut I'll just repeat it\\n\\nfor those of you that haven't heard it.\\n\\nI am not of the belief that all seed oils are bad,\\n\\nthat they're all inflammatory,\\n\\nthat they are killing us or making us sick,\\n\\nthat they are the major cause\\n\\nof metabolic dysfunction, et cetera.\\n\\nHowever, I think it is very clear,\\n\\nand I learned this from Dr. Lane Norton\\n\\nwhen he was a guest on this podcast\\n\\nand taught us all about nutrition in great depth.\\n\\nI highly recommend that episode\\n\\nif you're interested in nutrition,\\n\\nthat people are consuming a lot more oil generally,\\n\\nand a lot of those oils\\n\\nthat people are consuming more of nowadays\\n\\ninclude a lot of the so-called omega-6 fatty acids,\\n\\nand a lot of those oils are seed oils.\\n\\nThe particular omega-6 fatty acid\\n\\nthat's going to be relevant for today's discussion\\n\\nis linoleic acid,\\n\\nand that is common in a lot of seed oils.\\n\\nSo again, I'm not going to tell you\\n\\nthat seed oils are bad.\\n\\nHowever, it does seem to be the case\\n\\nthat many people are consuming far too many seed oils,\\n\\nand in doing so are consuming far too many calories,\\n\\nand perhaps are consuming too much\\n\\nof the omega-6 fatty acids\\n\\nrelative to the omega-3 fatty acids.\\n\\nNow, with that said,\\n\\nI think there is general agreement\\n\\namong nutritionists and health professionals\\n\\nthat we could all stand to get more omega-3 fatty acids,\\n\\nperhaps for cardiovascular health,\\n\\nalthough that's a little bit debated,\\n\\nbut certainly for immune system function,\\n\\nfor mood and for functioning of the brain,\\n\\nand for the potent anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3.\\n\\nSo again, omega-3s can be sourced from food,\\n\\nboth animal-based and plant-based.\\n\\nYou can simply go online\\n\\nand look up the various food-based sources.\\n\\nBut in thinking about headache\\n\\nand different treatments for headache,\\n\\nthere are some recent studies\\n\\nexploring how supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids,\\n\\nand in one case,\\n\\nhow supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids\\n\\nand deliberately reducing the amount of linoleic acid,\\n\\nthe omega-6 fatty acids,\\n\\nhow that can impact headache.\\n\\nSo the first study I'd like to describe\\n\\nin reference to the role\\n\\nof omega-3 fatty acids in headache was published in 2018,\\n\\nand the title of the paper\\n\\nis Long-Chain Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Headache\\n\\nin the U.S. Population.\\n\\nThere are a number of things\\n\\nthat I really like about this study.\\n\\nA few of those include the fact\\n\\nthat they looked at an enormous number of people.\\n\\nThat is, they included 12,317 men and women.\\n\\nI like the fact that they included men and women\\n\\nin the study, age 20 or older,\\n\\nand that they broke down the population\\n\\ninto categories that included age.\\n\\nThey certainly looked at race and ethnicity.\\n\\nThey looked at educational background.\\n\\nThey looked at body mass, total energy intake,\\n\\nwhich is really important.\\n\\nIf you think about it, people are going to be eating,\\n\\nand within the things that they eat,\\n\\nthey're going to be consuming some omega-3s, hopefully,\\n\\nas well as some omega-6s.\\n\\nAnd if they're eating far more,\\n\\nthen they're likely going to get far more\\n\\nof both of those things than they would ordinarily\\n\\nif they were eating a smaller amount.\\n\\nSo they controlled for total caloric intake\\n\\nin a way that I find particularly useful\\n\\nfor looking at these kind of data.\\n\\nSo the reason they explored omega-3s is worth mentioning.\\n\\nOmega-3 fatty acids are known to have\\n\\nan anti-inflammatory effect.\\n\\nThat anti-inflammatory effect is mediated\\n\\nthrough a couple of different pathways.\\n\\nWe won't go into these in too much detail now,\\n\\nbut the omega-3 fatty acids,\\n\\nkeep in mind, actually make up various parts of cells\\n\\nin the brain and body.\\n\\nThat's right, the membrane,\\n\\nthat remember I talked before about how steroid hormones\\n\\ncan go through the different membranes of the cells,\\n\\nthe outer membrane and the inner membrane.\\n\\nA lot of those actual membranes,\\n\\nthe structural constituents of neurons and other cells\\n\\nare actually made up of or include certain fatty acid,\\n\\nlong-chain fatty acids.\\n\\nAnd the omega-3 fatty acids are important\\n\\nfor the actual construction of those tissues,\\n\\nas well as having anti-inflammatory effects\\n\\nthrough things like limiting prostaglandins\\n\\nand other things that can cause inflammation.\\n\\nOkay, so there are a bunch of different ways\\n\\nthat omega-3 fatty acids can be useful.\\n\\nThey refer in this study to an earlier study\\n\\nthat looked at the so-called analgesic effect,\\n\\nthe pain relieving effect.\\n\\nAnalgesic means pain relieving effect\\n\\nof omega-3 fatty acids\\n\\nin what had been a randomized control trial.\\n\\nAnd in that previous paper,\\n\\nwhat they found was that diets high in omega-3s\\n\\nand low in omega-6s, okay,\\n\\nso high three, low six,\\n\\nand as compared to diets that were just reduced omega-6s,\\n\\nthey found a greater analgesic effect\\n\\nof increasing omega-3s\\n\\nwhile also reducing omega-6 fatty acids.\\n\\nSo in the context of the seed oil discussion,\\n\\nalthough keeping in mind that omega-6s\\n\\ncan come from other sources as well,\\n\\nif omega-6s were just reduced on their own,\\n\\nthere wasn't as great an effect\\n\\nin terms of reducing pain and inflammation\\n\\nas there was when omega-3 fatty acids\\n\\nwere deliberately increased\\n\\nand omega-6 fatty acids were reduced.\\n\\nAgain, in all of these studies,\\n\\nbecause these are the ones in which they\\n\\ncontrolled things well, as we say,\\n\\nthey are holding constant the caloric intake.\\n\\nSo it's not just that you're removing fat, eating less fat,\\n\\nthere's actually a removal of certain fats and fatty acids\\n\\nand a replacement of those with omega-3 fatty acids.\\n\\nIn one case, in the other case,\\n\\nit's just a reduction in omega-6s\\n\\nand you're using other food types and macronutrients\\n\\nto offset that reduction in calories\\n\\ncaused by reducing omega-6s.\\n\\nThe basic takeaway that they're relying on\\n\\nmarching into the study is that increasing omega-3s\\n\\nand reducing omega-6s seems to be beneficial\\n\\nfor reducing pain and indeed in this study,\\n\\nthey find something quite similar,\\n\\nwhich is that when you hold caloric intake constant\\n\\nand when you look at omega-6s,\\n\\nwhether or not you decrease omega-6 fatty acids or not,\\n\\nyou find is that increasing omega-3 fatty acids\\n\\nin the diet,\\n\\nso either consumed through food sources\\n\\nor by supplementation,\\n\\nwas associated with a lower prevalence\\n\\nof severe headache or migraine,\\n\\nso severe tension type headache or migraine.\\n\\nSo this is promising and points to the fact\\n\\nthat long chain omega-3 fatty acids\\n\\nare likely to have either a pain reducing\\n\\nand there's evidence for that\\n\\nand or an inflammation reducing effect\\n\\nthat can significantly reduce the severity of headache\\n\\nin both tension type headache and in migraine.\\n\\nSo that's the first study.\\n\\nThe second study is a more recent study,\\n\\nit was published in 2021 that used a,\\n\\nI would say a more or less similar type of overall design\\n\\nas the one I had referred to earlier.\\n\\nThe title of this paper is dietary alteration\\n\\nof what they call N3, but those are omega-3 and N6,\\n\\nomega-6, sorry for this shift in nomenclature,\\n\\nI didn't write the paper.\\n\\nDietary alteration of omega-3\\n\\nand omega-6 fatty acids for headache,\\n\\nreductions in adults with migraine\\n\\nand this was a randomized control trial.\\n\\nRandomized control trials involve having people\\n\\nbe in one condition where they do one thing\\n\\nand then they get swapped randomly into another condition.\\n\\nSo they serve as their own internal control\\n\\nand that controls for all sorts of things\\n\\nlike differences in sex, differences in age,\\n\\ndifferences in health background\\n\\nand any number of other variables as best as one can.\\n\\nIn this study, they had people either ingest a diet\\n\\nthat had increased omega-3s,\\n\\nso increased EPA and DHA\\n\\nor increased EPA and DHA\\n\\nand reduced amounts of linoleic acid,\\n\\nso that's going to reduce omega-6s\\n\\nor a control diet in which they had people taking,\\n\\nwell, it's essentially the average intake\\n\\nof omega-3s and omega-6s\\n\\nand you can probably already guess\\n\\nwhat the general results of the study are going to be.\\n\\nThe general results were that there were reductions\\n\\nin headaches.\\n\\nThe really cool thing is\\n\\nis it was a massive reduction in headache.\\n\\nThey refer to it as a robust reduction in headache\\n\\nin particular for the subjects\\n\\nthat increased their omega-3s\\n\\nand reduced the amount of linoleic acid that they took.\\n\\nThe other thing that I really like about this study\\n\\nis that while they don't know\\n\\nthe exact underlying mechanism for the effect,\\n\\nthey did spend some time delineating what it is\\n\\nthat the omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are likely doing\\n\\nto either offset or exacerbate headache.\\n\\nNow, I didn't say that omega-6 fatty acids\\n\\nexacerbate headache,\\n\\nbut it does seem that people\\n\\nwho ingest more linoleic acid in omega-6\\n\\nare experiencing more inflammation\\n\\nand that is evident in a bunch of different conditions.\\n\\nOne, for instance, is increases in things like CGRP.\\n\\nCGRP is a molecule that's associated\\n\\nwith a calcium signaling pathway.\\n\\nIt's involved in vasodilation,\\n\\nthe expansion of the blood vessels and capillaries\\n\\nand that's known, as I mentioned earlier,\\n\\nto exacerbate certain forms of headache.\\n\\nThere are also forms of headache\\n\\nthat can be caused by vasoconstriction.\\n\\nWe'll talk about one very dramatic example, perhaps,\\n\\nas we get toward the end.\\n\\nIt's a very uncommon example,\\n\\nbut it's called the thunderclap headache\\n\\nand trust me, you do not want a thunderclap headache.\\n\\nAnd so we'll talk about thunderclap headache\\n\\na little bit later.\\n\\nThat involves constriction of the blood vessels.\\n\\nIn any case, in this paper,\\n\\nthey didn't study mechanism directly,\\n\\nbut they're resting on this known analgesic anti-pain\\n\\nas well as known anti-inflammatory pathways\\n\\nrelated to increasing omega-3 intake\\n\\nand simultaneously resting on the idea\\n\\nwhere I think there's,\\n\\nI think we now can say conclusion\\n\\nthat omega-6 fatty acids, in particular linoleic acid,\\n\\ncan increase inflammation by way of increasing things\\n\\nlike CGRP, vasodilation and some other pathways related\\n\\nto the so-called inflammatory cytokine pathways.\\n\\nAnd there's a whole discussion nowadays\\n\\nof what's called the inflammatome.\\n\\nSo the basic takeaway is that\\n\\nif you are interested in reducing headache,\\n\\nit may be beneficial,\\n\\nat least according to these two studies\\n\\nand another one I'll talk about in a moment,\\n\\nto increase amounts of omega-3 fatty acids.\\n\\nAnd that can be done, again,\\n\\nthrough the ingestion of foods.\\n\\nAlthough based on the dosages\\n\\nthat we'll talk about in a moment,\\n\\nincreasing omega-3 fatty acids\\n\\nby taking liquid form fish oil,\\n\\nwhich is perhaps the most cost-effective way\\n\\nto supplement omega-3s or capsules,\\n\\nwhich is perhaps the most efficient way\\n\\nto supplement omega-3s,\\n\\nreally to a level of one gram or more of EPA per day.\\n\\nAgain, that's the EPA form in particular.\\n\\nSo if you're, for instance, taking supplemental fish oil\\n\\nor you're getting your omega-3s from food\\n\\nand you're getting what you determine to be 2000 milligrams\\n\\nor two grams per day of omega-3s,\\n\\nkeep in mind that's going to include EPA and DHA.\\n\\nAnd it does seem that getting above one gram per day\\n\\nof EPA omega-3 fatty acids,\\n\\neither through food or supplements or both,\\n\\nis going to be the critical threshold for reductions\\n\\nin the frequency and intensity of headaches\\n\\nthat include both tension headaches and migraine headaches.\\n\\nNow, some people will find actually\\n\\nthat ingesting far more omega-3 fatty acids,\\n\\ngenerally through supplementation,\\n\\nbut again, can be accomplished through foods as well,\\n\\ncan also be beneficial for other things such as mood.\\n\\nAnd indeed, there's a whole literature related to effects\\n\\nof ingesting one to three grams,\\n\\nagain, three grams per day of EPA.\\n\\nSo that's going to require quite a high intake of omega-3s\\n\\nin whatever form or supplement you decide\\n\\nto take those into your body,\\n\\nbut that can improve mood and so forth.\\n\\nThe basic range that I was able to find in the meta-analysis,\\n\\nso meta-analysis are where a researcher will look\\n\\nat the results of a bunch of different studies\\n\\nfocused on the same thing,\\n\\nlook at the different strength of those studies,\\n\\nthey'll do all sorts of cool statistical gymnastics,\\n\\nlike remove the most potent study,\\n\\nthe one that had the greatest effect\\n\\nand see whether or not there's still an effect\\n\\nof some treatment.\\n\\nOr for instance, they will swap in and out\\n\\ndifferent studies and different combinations\\n\\nto see whether or not any one study\\n\\nis really leading to the conclusion\\n\\nthat a given treatment does something.\\n\\nIn any case, in the meta-analysis of omega-3 fatty acids\\n\\nfor the treatment of headache,\\n\\nand that includes all the different kinds of headache,\\n\\nwhat they found in exploring a huge range\\n\\nof omega-3 supplementation,\\n\\nranging from 200 milligrams\\n\\nall the way up to 2000 milligrams per day,\\n\\nit really was at the one gram or higher dosage per day,\\n\\nwhere the significant impact\\n\\non reducing headache frequency and intensity was found.\\n\\nAnd just very briefly, earlier I mentioned\\n\\nthat not only has omega-3 fatty acid supplementation\\n\\nbeen shown to be effective in reducing the frequency\\n\\nand intensity of headache intention type\\n\\nand migraine type headache,\\n\\nbut it's also been shown to improve outcomes\\n\\nfor premenstrual syndrome related headaches.\\n\\nThese are what we referred to earlier\\n\\nas hormone-based headaches.\\n\\nAgain, the low estrogen, low progesterone\\n\\nassociated with certain phases of the menstrual cycle,\\n\\nas well as other phases of the menstrual cycle\\n\\nare often associated with headache.\\n\\nIn a study entitled Effective Omega-3 Fatty Acids\\n\\non Premenstrual Syndrome, a systematic review,\\n\\nand again, meta-analysis,\\n\\nwhat they found, and here I'm paraphrasing the conclusion,\\n\\nwas that omega-3 fatty acids could, yes,\\n\\neffectively reduce the severity of PMS symptoms.\\n\\nAnd one of the symptoms in particular\\n\\nthat they found that was reduced\\n\\nwas the pain-related symptoms associated with headache.\\n\\nAnd they actually had some very nice hypotheses\\n\\nas to why that likely would be.\\n\\nAnd in fact, point out that in earlier studies,\\n\\nomega-3 fatty acids have actually been considered\\n\\nas non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in some cases.\\n\\nAnd indeed, there are prescription forms\\n\\nof omega-3 fatty acids.\\n\\nAnd I highlight that not because I think people\\n\\nneed to run out and get the prescription form\\n\\nof omega-3 fatty acids.\\n\\nThey're actually quite hard to obtain and quite expensive.\\n\\nBut because I think oftentimes\\n\\nwhen we're talking about something like omega-3 fatty acids,\\n\\nthe fact that they are available over the counter\\n\\nin a supplement or by liquid,\\n\\nor available in food for that matter,\\n\\nleads many people to conclude that,\\n\\noh, you know, this is supplementation.\\n\\nThis is something that, you know,\\n\\nit's going to have relatively weak or minor impact\\n\\non things like headache or other health metrics.\\n\\nBut let's just say that the fact that it exists\\n\\nas a prescription drug in its highest potency form,\\n\\nat least in my opinion,\\n\\npoints to the potency of omega-3 fatty acids\\n\\nin dealing with analgesic effects,\\n\\nthat is reducing pain and anti-inflammation,\\n\\nas well as some of the known cardiovascular improvements\\n\\nthat are associated with increasing\\n\\nomega-3 fatty acid intake.\\n\\nPut simply, omega-3s are not just something\\n\\nthat comes from food or supplements.\\n\\nThey are also being marketed as prescription drugs.\\n\\nSo I do think they need to be considered as quite potent.\\n\\nAnd at least as far as these papers,\\n\\nthat again include meta-analyses\\n\\nof many other papers and data sets,\\n\\nindicate that supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids\\n\\nto a point where you're getting above one gram per day\\n\\nof EPA is not just going to be beneficial for treating\\n\\nand reducing the frequency and intensity\\n\\nof one particular type of headache,\\n\\nbut many types of headaches.\\n\\nAnd when you combine hormonal headaches,\\n\\ntension headaches, and migraine headaches,\\n\\nyou account for more than 70%\\n\\nof the total types of headaches that are out there.\\n\\nThe effects of omega-3s on cluster headaches\\n\\nand some of the other types of headaches,\\n\\nat least to my knowledge, have not been evaluated.\\n\\nThere's no reason to think that omega-3s\\n\\nwould not be beneficial for those types of headaches.\\n\\nBut at least as far as the data sets we talked about here\\n\\nare concerned, it is clear omega-3 fatty acids\\n\\nare going to be a very potent way to reduce pain\\n\\nand to reduce inflammation in ways\\n\\nthat can reduce the frequency and the intensity\\n\\nof different kinds of headache.\\n\\nBefore we continue our discussion\\n\\nabout many not commonly known and yet very potent treatments\\n\\nfor different forms of headache,\\n\\nI want to touch on a topic we mentioned a little bit earlier\\n\\nand also provide a treatment\\n\\nthat is a way to alleviate something,\\n\\nand that's photophobia and aura.\\n\\nNow keep in mind that earlier I referred to aura\\n\\nas this sense that something's about to happen.\\n\\nThat is true and that meaning\\n\\nthat is an accurate description of aura.\\n\\nBut oftentimes people also come to understand aura\\n\\nas feeling that something surrounds a given object visually\\n\\nor even that people have a sense\\n\\nthat something's around them.\\n\\nSo again, this can be a little bit vague,\\n\\nbut this idea that aura is a sense\\n\\nof something about to happen or that visually\\n\\nor in an auditory way and or maybe even in kind of a sense\\n\\nthat something is about to happen in a certain environment.\\n\\nAnd the reason I'm making kind of arc shapes with my hands\\n\\nfor those of you that are just listening,\\n\\nI'm making arc shapes with my hands,\\n\\nis that aura is often described as kind of a halo\\n\\nor a emanating out from one's body\\n\\nor from something that they're looking at.\\n\\nAgain, nothing spiritual about this\\n\\nin the context of the discussion about migraine and headache,\\n\\nbut rather many people experience photophobia,\\n\\nsometimes with aura, sometimes no.\\n\\nAnd I just want to touch on a couple of the mechanisms\\n\\nby which aura and photophobia occur\\n\\nand mention just briefly a pretty well-established way\\n\\nthat people can start to offset photophobia.\\n\\nAnd again, I mentioned that\\n\\nbecause many people experience photophobia in headache,\\n\\nbut there are also a number of people\\n\\nthat experience photophobia,\\n\\neven if they don't have intense headaches.\\n\\nSo photophobia is pretty common, pretty debilitating.\\n\\nIt actually is one of the reasons why people feel not well\\n\\nand need to leave work or not go to school\\n\\nor leave school, these kinds of things,\\n\\nor lay in bed all day or dim the lights, not go outside.\\n\\nAgain, sunlight being so congruent with health,\\n\\nyou can imagine how photophobia can lead\\n\\nto all sorts of negative downstream consequences.\\n\\nOkay, so what is aura and what is photophobia?\\n\\nThe exact origins of aura aren't exactly clear,\\n\\nbut it is generally thought that what aura represents\\n\\nis what's called spreading depression.\\n\\nAnd this is not depression of one's mood,\\n\\nalthough it can be associated with that.\\n\\nThis is depression of neuronal activity.\\n\\nAgain, neurons communicate with one another\\n\\nby generating electrical impulses\\n\\nthat travel down the length of their so-called axons,\\n\\nwhich are like little wires,\\n\\nand then they dump neurotransmitter out\\n\\nat the so-called synapse\\n\\nand impact the electrical activity of other neurons.\\n\\nDepression is a electrical,\\n\\nor I should say a chemo electrical,\\n\\nchemo electrical is the proper term,\\n\\nphenomenon in which the excitability of neurons is reduced.\\n\\nSo again, doesn't have anything to do with depression\\n\\nas a mood state per se,\\n\\nrather it is a reduced excitability of neurons.\\n\\nAnd it's been shown in some imaging studies\\n\\nthat aura is associated with a back-to-front,\\n\\nso from the back of the brain to front,\\n\\nspreading depression like a wave of lowering levels\\n\\nof electrical excitability.\\n\\nAnd because this originates in the visual cortex,\\n\\nwhich is in the back,\\n\\nso that's the part of your brain\\n\\nthat is making sense of visual images\\n\\ncoming in through the eyes\\n\\nand relayed through other stations in the brain,\\n\\nthat people will start to see a kind of halo of light\\n\\nor that they'll start to feel that the light around them\\n\\nis literally surrounding their body\\n\\nor some other object or body that they're looking at.\\n\\nAnd then it spreads forward in the brain,\\n\\nand that's when it tends to stretch over\\n\\ninto other so-called sensory modalities.\\n\\nSensory modalities being things like touch\\n\\nor hearing, so people will get the sense\\n\\nthat they're kind of seeing something\\n\\nin their periphery of their vision,\\n\\nthen they'll start feeling something around them.\\n\\nThere's a sense that something's about to happen.\\n\\nSo as this spreading wave of depression\\n\\ngoes from back to front,\\n\\npeople experience a number of these different\\n\\nsemi-abstract sensory phenomena that we call aura, okay?\\n\\nSo that's how aura originates.\\n\\nNow, photophobia is a little bit different.\\n\\nPhotophobia, we now understand\\n\\nbecause of some beautiful work\\n\\nthat was done at Cliff Saper's lab\\n\\nat Harvard Medical School and some other laboratories\\n\\nshowing that photophobia originates\\n\\nfrom a specific set of neurons in the eye.\\n\\nWe call these the intrinsically photosensitive melanops\\n\\nand ganglion cells, which is really just a mouthful\\n\\nof nerd speak for neurons in the eye\\n\\nthat connect to the brain, these so-called ganglion cells\\n\\nthat respond most robustly to bright blue light\\n\\nor other short wavelength light.\\n\\nSo you've got short wavelength light\\n\\nthat is blue and greens are short wavelengths\\n\\nand then long wavelength light, which is red\\n\\nor it can even be out past where it would be infrared.\\n\\nWe don't detect infrared consciously.\\n\\nOther species do like pit vipers can see in the infrared.\\n\\nThey can even heat sense.\\n\\nSo short wavelength light is going to be light\\n\\nthat's bright blue, green.\\n\\nIt's what's very common in fluorescent bulbs\\n\\nthat are commonly used in household lighting\\n\\nand workplace lighting\\n\\nand other forms of artificial lighting.\\n\\nIt's also of course present in sunlight.\\n\\nSunlight includes a huge range of wavelengths\\n\\nincluding long wavelength light, of course.\\n\\nYou've seen that as the reds and oranges\\n\\nin the sunset and so on.\\n\\nThose intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells\\n\\nin the eye respond best to bright green or blue light.\\n\\nAnd they send connections\\n\\nto a bunch of different places in the brain\\n\\nincluding the so-called central circadian clock,\\n\\nsuper chiasmatic nucleus\\n\\nthat sets your day, night, sleep, wake rhythms.\\n\\nThis is why I encourage people\\n\\nto view sunlight in the morning,\\n\\nto set this system in motion,\\n\\nto avoid bright light exposure at night\\n\\nfrom artificial sources\\n\\nin order to not send wake-up signals\\n\\nfrom the eye to the brain\\n\\nand then onto the rest of the body.\\n\\nBut these intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells\\n\\nare also known to connect with other areas of the brain,\\n\\nmany other areas of the brain in fact.\\n\\nAnd one of the important areas of the brain they connect to\\n\\nas it relates to photophobia\\n\\nis an area of a structure called the thalamus.\\n\\nThe thalamus is an egg-like structure\\n\\nthat sits in the center of the brain.\\n\\nAnd it serves as a kind of a switchboard\\n\\nand like a sensory relay\\n\\nby which information coming from the eyes,\\n\\nfrom the ears, from the touch system, et cetera,\\n\\nare funneled into different compartments in the thalamus\\n\\nand then sent to different other areas of the brain.\\n\\nSo think of it kind of like an old-fashioned switchboard\\n\\nor you could think of it sort of like in an airport,\\n\\nyou go to a particular wing of the airport,\\n\\nthen you go to a particular gate and so on.\\n\\nYou're getting funneled progressively\\n\\nthrough narrower and narrower channels\\n\\nuntil you arrive at your particular plane.\\n\\nMuch in the same way,\\n\\nthe thalamus has a bunch of different entry points.\\n\\nSo it's sensory information coming in\\n\\nfrom a bunch of different sources\\n\\nand those sources get routed\\n\\ninto progressively narrower and narrower funnels\\n\\nto eventually arrive at the accurate place\\n\\nfor their function.\\n\\nSo these intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells\\n\\nsend connections to a small but important area\\n\\nof the thalamus called LP.\\n\\nIt's denoted L, the letter, and P,\\n\\nwith lateral posterior thalamus,\\n\\nor I should say it's the lateral posterior nucleus\\n\\nof the thalamus for U of S C natos out there.\\n\\nAnd then the neurons in that location are going to respond,\\n\\nthat is they're going to be activated\\n\\nby bright blue light, green light,\\n\\nor any kind of bright light originating\\n\\nfrom artificial sources or from sunlight.\\n\\nAnd the neurons there that respond to that\\n\\nhave a very interesting pattern of connections.\\n\\nThey send connections up to the so-called sensory cortex.\\n\\nSo a bunch of different layers throughout the cortex\\n\\nthat are not associated with visual perception,\\n\\nthat is they're not associated with understanding\\n\\nthat there are shapes and contours in the environment,\\n\\nbut rather to neurons that are involved\\n\\nin the detection of pressure, pain,\\n\\nand other forms of sensory information\\n\\nat the level of what?\\n\\nThe meninges.\\n\\nAnd we talked about the meninges earlier.\\n\\nSo again, while the brain itself\\n\\ndoes not have a sensory system to detect pain,\\n\\nthe tissues around it do,\\n\\nand the tissues around those tissues,\\n\\nthat is the stuff around the meninges,\\n\\nthemselves can respond to pain.\\n\\nAnd intracranial pressure is also relayed\\n\\nthrough the meninges to our conscious awareness\\n\\nthat there's pain.\\n\\nSo what does this mean for photophobia?\\n\\nIt means that bright blue light and green light,\\n\\nand of course light from sunlight,\\n\\nwill activate these neurons in the eye,\\n\\nthese intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells,\\n\\nwhich then activate the lateral posterior neurons,\\n\\nand those LP neurons communicate with areas of the brain\\n\\nthat are specifically tuned\\n\\nto different sensory phenomenon and in particular pain\\n\\nat the level of the meninges and intracranial pressure.\\n\\nWhat this means is that when we have headache,\\n\\nor if we simply have photophobia on its own,\\n\\nthat bright light is actually the trigger\\n\\nfor pain sensing and even the creation of pain\\n\\nat the level of the meninges and intracranial pressure.\\n\\nWhat does this mean in terms of dealing with\\n\\nor treating photophobia?\\n\\nWell, most people deal with photophobia\\n\\nby deciding to turn off or dim all the lights\\n\\nand simply getting under the covers\\n\\nor wearing a very low brim hat and putting on sunglasses\\n\\nand they want to lie down.\\n\\nAnd sometimes because migraine can be associated\\n\\nwith nausea or even vomiting in its severe instances rather.\\n\\nBut one very simple way to avoid activation\\n\\nof these retinal ganglion cells\\n\\nthat would trigger photophobia,\\n\\nis that if you are starting to feel\\n\\nlike you have a migraine coming on\\n\\nor you have photophobia coming on,\\n\\nto shift to using patterns of light\\n\\nthat are in the longer wavelength domain.\\n\\nWhat that means practically is shifting\\n\\nto using very orange, ideally dim,\\n\\nbut very orange and a red light.\\n\\nNow, this is not a call for people to go out\\n\\nand invest in expensive red light therapies.\\n\\nAdmittedly, there are some excellent case uses\\n\\nfor red light therapy,\\n\\nparticular for acne, wound healing,\\n\\neven for improving vision,\\n\\nespecially in people beyond the age of 40\\n\\nfor some hormone augmentation.\\n\\nWe talked all about that in the episode\\n\\nthat I did on light and health.\\n\\nAgain, you can find that at hubermanlab.com,\\n\\neverything timestamped.\\n\\nWhat I'm talking about here would be\\n\\nsimply having some red light bulbs on hand\\n\\nfor any time that you need to remain awake,\\n\\nbut you're starting to experience photophobia.\\n\\nThese red light bulbs can be purchased very inexpensively\\n\\nas party lights.\\n\\nYou can buy these online.\\n\\nSo there is no specific need to get any,\\n\\nI would say, red light that's designed specifically\\n\\nfor photophobia or anything of that sort.\\n\\nYou can find the cheapest red light available out there\\n\\nand those will simply work.\\n\\nThe idea being that for many people\\n\\nwho are experiencing photophobia,\\n\\nthey want to reduce that feeling of pain\\n\\nand pressure in their head experienced through photophobia.\\n\\nThey also might want to stay awake,\\n\\nget some work done and do things.\\n\\nSo operating under red light,\\n\\nor I should say living, working, et cetera,\\n\\nunder red light would allow you to stay awake,\\n\\nnot have to hide under the covers\\n\\nif you're experiencing photophobia.\\n\\nIn addition, and I mentioned this\\n\\nat the beginning of the episode,\\n\\nbut many people find photophobia to be a entry point\\n\\nor a trigger to headache.\\n\\nSo what happens is they start to experience some aura,\\n\\nsome onset of photophobia,\\n\\nand then the photophobia itself leads to this feeling\\n\\nin malaise that then converts into headache.\\n\\nAnd so while there are not a lot of clinical data\\n\\non this just yet, an emerging idea\\n\\nin the realm of headache treatment is the idea\\n\\nthat if you can offset some of the early signs,\\n\\nyou can offset some of that photophobia and aura,\\n\\nperhaps through the use of dim red lights\\n\\nor red lights, as I've described a moment ago,\\n\\nthen you might be able to reduce the probability\\n\\nthat you're going to have a migraine\\n\\nor other type of headache entirely.\\n\\nSo again, no need for expensive red lights,\\n\\nbut you can find red lights very easily online\\n\\nand simply have them on hand\\n\\nor replace the current lights that you have\\n\\non your nightstand or in whatever room you happen to be in\\n\\nwith these red lights.\\n\\nThese red lights are also, I should mention,\\n\\nvery useful in limiting the amount of cortisol,\\n\\na stress hormone that is very healthy for us\\n\\nto release at high levels early in the day.\\n\\nIn fact, viewing sunlight will increase cortisol levels.\\n\\nThis is another reason why what I'm about to say\\n\\nis relevant to photophobia.\\n\\nBut if you want to keep cortisol levels low\\n\\nin the evening and at night, and indeed you do,\\n\\nand improve the transition to sleep\\n\\nand indeed your sleep overall,\\n\\nreducing cortisol at evening time and at nighttime\\n\\nis extremely beneficial,\\n\\nand red lights will help you accomplish that.\\n\\nI talked about that in the episode on light and health.\\n\\nSo the point here is that if you suffer from photophobia\\n\\nwith or without aura, using red lights\\n\\nand not simply dimming ordinary artificial lights\\n\\nor feeling that you have to turn off all lights entirely\\n\\nis going to be one relatively inexpensive,\\n\\nor I should say very inexpensive in some cases,\\n\\nbecause these red lights can be found\\n\\nvery inexpensively online,\\n\\nway to be able to continue with your daily activities,\\n\\nat least in an indoor environment,\\n\\nif you are suffering from photophobia.\\n\\nSo shifting back to ways to reduce the intensity\\n\\nand frequency of different kinds of headaches.\\n\\nWe haven't talked so much about\\n\\ntension headaches specifically.\\n\\nSo that's what I'd like to do now.\\n\\nAs you recall, tension headaches\\n\\nare going to be muscular in origin.\\n\\nAgain, keeping in mind that everything's neural\\n\\nwhen it comes to pain.\\n\\nEverything's neural when it comes to everything, frankly,\\n\\nbecause every organ and tissue system in our body\\n\\nis ultimately controlled by our nervous system.\\n\\nBut tension headaches are often associated\\n\\nwith tension of the muscles that are on the skull,\\n\\nof the jaw, of the neck,\\n\\nand can be quite painful for many people and debilitating.\\n\\nAnd the most common treatment for this\\n\\nthat most people rely on that is,\\n\\nis to take non-steroid anti-inflammatory.\\n\\nSo things like acetaminophen, ibuprofen,\\n\\nsometimes aspirin and things of that sort.\\n\\nAnd oftentimes those can be helpful.\\n\\nThere are a couple of things to keep in mind, however,\\n\\nthe NSAIDs, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs,\\n\\noftentimes will work very well at first,\\n\\nbut people quickly develop a tolerance to them,\\n\\nmeaning they're going to have to take more and more\\n\\nin order to get the same effect.\\n\\nAnd oftentimes they can't take more and more\\n\\nbecause some of them are very hard on the liver.\\n\\nAnd in addition to that,\\n\\nsome of them can offset some other things\\n\\nthat you really want.\\n\\nSo for instance, it's now known\\n\\nthat non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs\\n\\ncan offset some of the benefits of exercise.\\n\\nAnd that makes sense\\n\\nbecause a lot of the adaptive benefits of exercise\\n\\nactually come from experiencing\\n\\na lot of inflammation acutely.\\n\\nThat means you actually want inflammation\\n\\nduring your resistance training workout,\\n\\nor even your endurance workout.\\n\\nBut then that inflammation triggers an adaptation event\\n\\nor series of adaptation events\\n\\nthat leads to greater strength, greater speed,\\n\\nmore muscle, more endurance,\\n\\nwhatever it is that you happen to be training for.\\n\\nSo reducing pain can be good, of course,\\n\\nbut not if you have to take more and more of a given drug\\n\\nthat it has side effects on the liver\\n\\nand can offset the effects of exercise and so forth.\\n\\nThe other issue with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs\\n\\nis that many of them simply do not work for many people.\\n\\nOr again, they'll work the first time and the second time,\\n\\nbut then they stop working.\\n\\nThey also tend to lower body temperature.\\n\\nI think most people are aware of this\\n\\nbecause many of these same drugs are used\\n\\nin order to reduce fever.\\n\\nBut if you are taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs\\n\\nsimply to reduce your headache\\n\\nand you're lowering core body temperature,\\n\\nthat can have all sorts of downstream issues\\n\\nrelated to sleep-wake cycles, to metabolism,\\n\\nto immune system function more generally, and on and on.\\n\\nFor that reason, there's been quite a lot of exploration\\n\\nof alternatives to non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs\\n\\nfor the treatment of headache and indeed pain generally.\\n\\nBut today we're talking about headache.\\n\\nNow, as it relates to tension headache,\\n\\none of the more advanced kind of modern treatments\\n\\nthat you sometimes hear about is Botox, right?\\n\\nBotox, I think most people are familiar with\\n\\nas the thing that people get injected into their face,\\n\\naround the eyes or around the lips or elsewhere\\n\\nin order to, quote unquote, reduce wrinkles.\\n\\nIt was discovered some years ago\\n\\nwhen Botox treatments were being done for cosmetic reasons\\n\\nthat it could often be very effective for relieving headache\\n\\nif injected into the muscles.\\n\\nAnd the way that it works is that, of course,\\n\\ntension headache involves a tension of the muscles,\\n\\nwe'll call it clenching or cinching up of the muscles,\\n\\nbut what we're really talking about\\n\\nis contraction of the muscles,\\n\\nand that's controlled by neurons.\\n\\nNeurons, which are neuromuscular,\\n\\nso neuromuscular neurons don't form synapses with\\n\\nor connections with other neurons,\\n\\nthey form synapses with muscle,\\n\\nthey release acetylcholine onto the muscle\\n\\nand that makes the muscle contract.\\n\\nThis is the way you move the limbs of your body,\\n\\nthis is also the way the muscles of your head contract\\n\\nand can give you tension type headaches.\\n\\nBotox arises from, or is rather botulinum neurotoxin.\\n\\nBotulinum neurotoxin is a toxin that's found in canned goods,\\n\\nnot all canned goods, of course,\\n\\nand what it does is it prevents a certain step\\n\\nin the release of so-called neurotransmitter\\n\\nin the little packets that they live in,\\n\\nwhich are called vesicles,\\n\\nlittle spheres of neurotransmitter,\\n\\nlive at the end of neuron nerve terminals\\n\\nand are released onto the muscle, make the muscle contract.\\n\\nBotulinum neurotoxin cleaves a particular protein in there,\\n\\nfor you aficionados who want to look this up,\\n\\nit's a really cool mechanism,\\n\\nit cleaves something called SNAP25.\\n\\nSNAP25 is involved in the fusion of those little spheres\\n\\nwith the membrane of the neuron\\n\\nand releasing of the neurotransmitter.\\n\\nSo when botulinum neurotoxin is present\\n\\nat the nerve muscle interface,\\n\\nthose nerves cannot communicate with the muscle\\n\\nand as a consequence, the muscles undergo kind of flaccid tone,\\n\\nthey just kind of relax there underneath the skin.\\n\\nSure, wrinkles are relieved,\\n\\nbut if Botox is injected into the muscles themselves,\\n\\nit can provide long lasting relief\\n\\nof certain types of headaches,\\n\\nin particular tension type headaches.\\n\\nSo while it seems like a bit of an extreme treatment,\\n\\npeople who suffer very badly from tension type headaches\\n\\ndue to hypercontraction of the muscles of the forehead\\n\\nor around the temples or around the jaws\\n\\nor certain parts of the neck and the muscles of the neck\\n\\nthat encroach on the back of the skull\\n\\nor that actually connect to the back of the skull\\n\\ncan achieve tremendous long lasting relief\\n\\nfrom these Botox injections,\\n\\nsometimes for weeks or months or even longer,\\n\\npeople go in for periodic re-ups of Botox.\\n\\nIt actually is quite safe,\\n\\ndespite the fact that botulinum neurotoxin is quite dangerous,\\n\\nit's given in very low doses and given locally,\\n\\nso those are the only muscles affected.\\n\\nSo that's how Botox is used to treat headaches\\n\\nand it's a very effective treatment at that.\\n\\nOf course, many people I imagine are interested\\n\\nin not just drug-based treatments\\n\\nand not Botox type treatments for treating headache,\\n\\nbut other types of treatments for headache\\n\\nthat are of the more, let's call them natural\\n\\nor non-drug treatments.\\n\\nAnd here we're starting to get into the realm\\n\\nof the kind of herbal and oil-based treatments for headache.\\n\\nNow, I confess when I first started researching\\n\\nthis area of headache and treatment for headaches that is,\\n\\nI found myself approaching it with a bit of trepidation\\n\\nbecause when I started to hear about essential oils\\n\\nand about herbal medications and things of that sort,\\n\\nI thought, okay, well, there'll probably be some effects.\\n\\nI mean, admittedly, we've talked before on this podcast\\n\\nabout things like apigenin.\\n\\nApigenin is one of the core components of chamomile\\n\\nand chamomile is known to make people feel\\n\\na little bit sleepy and can enhance sleep.\\n\\nWell, apigenin in high concentration\\n\\ncan indeed augment sleep.\\n\\nWe talk about this in our sleep toolkit.\\n\\nBy the way, we don't just have episodes about sleep,\\n\\nmaster your sleep, perfect your sleep, et cetera,\\n\\nbut if you go to the hubermanlab.com website\\n\\nand you go to the menu and you click on newsletter,\\n\\nyou can scroll down and you'll see\\n\\nthat we have a toolkit for sleep.\\n\\nThere's completely zero cost to access.\\n\\nYou don't even have to sign up\\n\\nalthough if you'd like to sign up\\n\\nfor future newsletters, you can get those.\\n\\nOne of the key components of the toolkit for sleep,\\n\\nin addition to behavioral tools\\n\\nand things that are not supplement-based,\\n\\nis apigenin, which is this component from chamomile.\\n\\nSo the idea that certain herbal derivatives\\n\\nor herbs or oils could be very useful\\n\\nfor improving symptoms of whatever,\\n\\nin this case, improving sleep with apigenin,\\n\\nis not unheard of and in fact,\\n\\nthe data continued to be released all the time\\n\\nthat many of the things that we think of as herbal, et cetera,\\n\\ncan actually have quite potent effects.\\n\\nAnd so while I myself was approaching the discussion\\n\\nabout essential oils and, or I should say oils, right?\\n\\nWho's to say if they're essential or not?\\n\\nOils and herbs in the treatment of headache,\\n\\nI finished out my research on this literature\\n\\nfeeling quite, I should say, surprised\\n\\nand as if I need to really check myself a bit\\n\\nbecause what I found is that there are certain herbs\\n\\nand oils, for instance, that far outperform\\n\\nnon-steroid and anti-inflammatory drugs\\n\\nfor the treatment of headache.\\n\\nThat's right, there are certain oils\\n\\nthat are available over the counter\\n\\nthat when looked at in many studies, meta-analyses,\\n\\nand I'll tell you about one particular study\\n\\nand a meta-analyses in a moment,\\n\\nthey show that they can reduce the frequency\\n\\nand intensity of headache in a manner\\n\\nthat far outpaces what you observe\\n\\nwith non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs\\n\\nwith apparently none of the same issues\\n\\nassociated with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs.\\n\\nSo I think it's really worth paying attention to.\\n\\nThe first of those studies I'd like to describe to you\\n\\nis one that has now become kind of a classic\\n\\nin the literature, I should say,\\n\\nat least for those that are interested\\n\\nin the atypical treatments for headache.\\n\\nAnd the title of this paper is\\n\\nEffective Peppermint and Eucalyptus Oil Preparations\\n\\non Neurophysiological and Experimental\\n\\nAlgezometric Headache Parameters.\\n\\nOkay, what does that mean?\\n\\nWell, this is an interesting study\\n\\nbecause rather than look at the effectiveness\\n\\nof peppermint and eucalyptus oil and other oils on headache,\\n\\nwhat they did is because they want to look\\n\\nat the mechanisms underlying headache,\\n\\nwhich I confess I love,\\n\\nthe fact that they want to understand the neurophysiology\\n\\nand not just get subjective ratings of headache,\\n\\nalthough they did that too,\\n\\nbut they really want to understand\\n\\nhow these oils can impact things like muscular tension\\n\\nor perception of pain.\\n\\nWhat they did is they recreated headache in human subjects\\n\\nby using tightening cuffs of the head.\\n\\nThey cut off blood supply to certain areas of the head.\\n\\nThey basically induced headache.\\n\\nAnd then they measured things like the EMG,\\n\\nthe muscle response at the level of electrophysiology\\n\\nin the muscle.\\n\\nAnd of course, subjective measures\\n\\nof how much people perceive to be in pain or not in pain.\\n\\nI'll give you the broad contour of the study\\n\\nbecause I want to make sure that it's the conclusions\\n\\nthat come through most clearly,\\n\\nand we will provide a link to the study\\n\\nin our show note captions.\\n\\nSo what they did is they had people use\\n\\none of four different preparations.\\n\\nSo they have preparation one,\\n\\nwhich includes some peppermint oil and some eucalyptus oil.\\n\\nAnd all the details about the amount\\n\\nand the relative percentages are in the paper\\n\\nfor you to peruse online\\n\\nthrough the link I mentioned before.\\n\\nSo they had four different groups.\\n\\nThey had one group apply peppermint oil,\\n\\nbut that peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil.\\n\\nThey had another group use just peppermint oil.\\n\\nThey had another group use just tiny traces of peppermint oil\\n\\nand smaller doses of eucalyptus oil.\\n\\nAnd then they had a fourth group,\\n\\nwhich was just using placebo.\\n\\nWhen I say using, what they were doing\\n\\nis they were sponge applying the oil\\n\\nto the temples and forehead of people.\\n\\nAnd then what they did is they used these different approaches\\n\\nto measure the activation of muscles, to measure pain.\\n\\nAnd they then induced head pain.\\n\\nThey induced headache.\\n\\nSo, and they looked at the temporal muscles on the side.\\n\\nThey looked at forehead muscles, things of that sort.\\n\\nSo they use three different types of pain stimuli.\\n\\nThey looked at people's sensitivity\\n\\nto experimentally induced pain by either providing pressure.\\n\\nSo this was kind of a cuff around the forehead\\n\\nor thermal pain.\\n\\nSo they actually had them basically heated up\\n\\nat the level of the skin.\\n\\nAnd actually they brought the heat up pretty high\\n\\nto the point where people were rating the pain\\n\\nalmost to the point of excessive pain and pain limits.\\n\\nSo they obviously couldn't take them\\n\\nto the point of extreme pain.\\n\\nAnd they had a constriction type condition\\n\\nin which they cut off blood circulation\\n\\nto the pericranial muscles\\n\\nusing an inflatable collar around the cranium.\\n\\nAnd they inflated that to pretty high pressure.\\n\\nSo kind of a brutal experiment to be involved in,\\n\\nbut look, they're trying to mimic headache.\\n\\nAnd I think by using these different approaches,\\n\\nthey're able to mimic the different aspects of headache\\n\\nand make sure, and here's the key point,\\n\\nthat every person in the study\\n\\nis not just getting the same treatment for headache,\\n\\nbut is getting the same headache.\\n\\nAnd that's something that I think gives this study power.\\n\\nIt's not the only way to do a study like this,\\n\\nbut it gives it a lot of power\\n\\nin trying to understand which types of interventions\\n\\nare going to assist in headache\\n\\nand maybe even specific dimensions of the pain in headache.\\n\\nAnd basically what they found in this study\\n\\nis that of all the treatments they used,\\n\\nthe essential plant oil preparations\\n\\nthat contained peppermint,\\n\\nand I'll just mention as an aside,\\n\\nand in other studies, menthol,\\n\\nso these minty type essential,\\n\\nminty type, what we think of as flavors,\\n\\nbut are really aromas as well.\\n\\nAnd as I'll point out the mechanism in a moment,\\n\\nthey had the effect of significantly reducing\\n\\nthe intensity of the pain.\\n\\nThat is subjects could tolerate the pain far better\\n\\nand experienced less pain subjectively.\\n\\nAnd the magnitude of the effects\\n\\nwere really pretty impressive.\\n\\nAgain, I went into all of this thinking essential oils.\\n\\nOkay, that's like some really woo stuff.\\n\\nYou know, I don't know about that,\\n\\nbut it turns out that these essential oils,\\n\\nat least the ones that contain peppermint oil\\n\\nwith or without eucalyptus oil\\n\\nperformed very well in reducing pain.\\n\\nThe key takeaway from the study is,\\n\\nand here I'm paraphrasing from the study\\n\\nthat the combination of peppermint oil, eucalyptus oil,\\n\\nand these are basically in a ethanol suspension.\\n\\nAgain, people are not drinking these essential oils.\\n\\nI want to be very clear.\\n\\nThey're applying these to the skin\\n\\naround the area that's in pain,\\n\\nand particularly the temple and the foreheads.\\n\\nIncreased cognitive performance.\\n\\nI didn't talk about that,\\n\\nbut this is the ability to maintain cognitive functioning\\n\\nwhile in pain.\\n\\nYou know, here we're talking about headache up until now\\n\\njust as kind of pain,\\n\\nbut that pain can be very debilitating\\n\\nfor your ability to work and perform and do other things.\\n\\nSo this combination of peppermint oil and eucalyptus oil\\n\\napplied to the skin\\n\\nallowed people to increase their cognitive performance\\n\\nwhile under pain,\\n\\nand it had a very muscle relaxing\\n\\nand mentally relaxing effect.\\n\\nMental relaxation was of course measured subjectively,\\n\\nbut remember, one of the things\\n\\nthat led me to feature this study\\n\\nin this episode in particular is that\\n\\nthey didn't just say,\\n\\noh, my muscles feel more relaxed.\\n\\nThey actually saw that the muscles\\n\\nof the forehead and temples\\n\\nand some surrounding muscles were more relaxed\\n\\nwhen people had these oils applied\\n\\nto their forehead and the temples.\\n\\nNot perhaps to the same degree\\n\\nthat one would observe with Botox\\n\\nor for the same extent or duration\\n\\nas one would experience with Botox,\\n\\nbut much in the same way,\\n\\nwhich then raises the question of,\\n\\nwell, what's going on here?\\n\\nI mean, is this all placebo effect?\\n\\nWell, no, because they compared to placebo\\n\\nand they controlled for the odor, of course,\\n\\nof the oil that was applied\\n\\nso that everyone thought that they were getting\\n\\nessentially the same thing.\\n\\nPun intended.\\n\\nBut in this case, what they found is that\\n\\nif they applied the essential oil\\n\\nto the forehead and temples,\\n\\nthat people experience more or less a cooling sensation\\n\\nor they could feel as if something was happening\\n\\nin the underlying muscle.\\n\\nWell, what was happening?\\n\\nWe now know that menthol, peppermint,\\n\\nand other things that smell that way and taste that way\\n\\nactually have an impact on the sensory neurons\\n\\nat the level of the skin\\n\\nand can actually inhibit certain sensory neurons\\n\\nand can activate other sensory neurons.\\n\\nOkay, so in order to understand this,\\n\\nwe have to go back to what I said\\n\\nat the beginning of the episode,\\n\\nwhich is that you have motor neurons.\\n\\nThese are neurons that constrict muscles,\\n\\nor excuse me, that cause contraction of muscles.\\n\\nThey don't constrict them.\\n\\nThey cause contraction of muscles.\\n\\nYou have sensory neurons,\\n\\nwhich sense different things, light, sound, or touch,\\n\\nand you have modulatory neurons.\\n\\nMenthol and eucalyptus are actually known\\n\\nto activate certain channels in the sensory neurons\\n\\nthat respond not just to touch,\\n\\nbut also the sensation of cooling.\\n\\nOkay, so when we think of menthol and peppermint,\\n\\nwe think of kind of cool scents and flavors,\\n\\ncool meaning cold.\\n\\nAnd when we think of things like hot peppers, capsaicin,\\n\\nwe think of anything that has a hot temperature,\\n\\nwe tend to think of spicy.\\n\\nSo spicy and hot go together,\\n\\nand peppermint and menthol and cool go together,\\n\\nmuch in the way that the gum commercials\\n\\nor the mint commercials would lead you to believe,\\n\\nand in fact, they're right.\\n\\nSo what's happening here is that the application\\n\\nof these oils is very likely activating channels\\n\\nin the sensory neurons, including the trip channels,\\n\\nbut others as well, that are leading to the analgesic effect\\n\\nby shutting down the heat and pain pathways,\\n\\nbecause heat and pain,\\n\\nwhile they're not exactly the same in our nervous system,\\n\\nthey are funneled through common pathways,\\n\\nwhereas cooling and pain relief\\n\\nare funneled through alternate\\n\\nwhat we call parallel pathways.\\n\\nSo this study on peppermint and eucalyptus oil preparations\\n\\nin reducing pain of headache\\n\\nand different aspects of pain due to headache,\\n\\nI think are really important\\n\\nbecause they don't just illustrate the fact that,\\n\\nyes, indeed, and I'll go on record saying it\\n\\nbecause that's what the data say,\\n\\nand there are other papers\\n\\nto support this statement as well.\\n\\nEssential oils applied to the skin\\n\\ncan reduce the symptoms of tension headache\\n\\nin a significant way,\\n\\nand actually can lead to some offset\\n\\nof some of the cognitive defects seen with headaches.\\n\\nSo that's itself very impressive, I must say.\\n\\nBut surprising for me, it kind of put me in my place\\n\\nas somebody who thought,\\n\\noh, essential oils is going to be like, okay,\\n\\nbut it's actually seemed to really hold some merit.\\n\\nAnd when you compare the magnitude of the effect,\\n\\neven though this was an enormous number of subjects,\\n\\nyou compare the magnitude of the effect\\n\\nin a paper like this or similar papers\\n\\non these essential oils\\n\\nto the impact of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs,\\n\\nand they really hold their own\\n\\nand in some cases exceed the positive impact\\n\\nof anti-inflammatory drugs.\\n\\nSo for that reason, I think we can look at peppermint oils\\n\\nand peppermint and eucalyptus containing oils,\\n\\nmenthol containing oils applied to the skin\\n\\nfor the treatment of tension type headache\\n\\nas among the more potent treatments available out there.\\n\\nNow, another way to approach treatment of tension headache\\n\\nis something that many of you have probably heard\\n\\nabout before, and then I've talked a little bit about\\n\\non this podcast in previous episodes,\\n\\nand that's acupuncture.\\n\\nWe will do an entire episode all about acupuncture,\\n\\nbut much in the same way that essential oils,\\n\\nI think for many people, not all,\\n\\nbut for many people are considered kind of a woo biology\\n\\nor people think of it as very alternative medicine.\\n\\nKeep in mind that as the underlying mechanisms\\n\\nof things like these peppermint oils\\n\\nare starting to be discovered\\n\\nor omega-3s are starting to be discovered,\\n\\nmechanistically, they hold up very well.\\n\\nThere's a logic there.\\n\\nThere's an underlying understanding\\n\\nof not just why they should work,\\n\\nbut in many cases, how they work.\\n\\nIn the same way, acupuncture,\\n\\nwhich of course has existed for thousands of years,\\n\\nhas been used very successfully to treat headache\\n\\nand other forms of pain, so much so\\n\\nthat many insurance companies will now pay for acupuncture\\n\\nas an insured practice, not all, but many will.\\n\\nAnd in addition to that, the scientific community\\n\\nis starting to understand mechanistically\\n\\nhow acupuncture works.\\n\\nSo I don't want to make this the major focus for now,\\n\\nbut very briefly, there's a laboratory\\n\\nat Harvard Medical School run by Chu Fu Ma.\\n\\nChu Fu is well known in the neuroscience community\\n\\nfor doing excellent work in parsing the mechanisms\\n\\nof touch sensation and pain in particular.\\n\\nSo not just touch at the level of skin,\\n\\nbut pain and pain pathways.\\n\\nAnd in recent years, his laboratory has started\\n\\nto do studies on how acupuncture works,\\n\\nbecause indeed acupuncture has been known to work\\n\\nto alleviate pain for a long time,\\n\\nbut the underlying mechanisms haven't been clear.\\n\\nWhat Chu Fu's lab has published now\\n\\nin excellent journals like Nature, Science,\\n\\nand other journals is that the precise insertion sites\\n\\nof different needles lead to activation of sensory neurons\\n\\nand their downstream pathways\\n\\nin ways that can potently reduce inflammation\\n\\nand that can be used to potently reduce the activity\\n\\nof certain muscles, for instance,\\n\\nmuscles in the forehead and temples.\\n\\nSo when you hear acupuncture can reduce pain,\\n\\nI think some people think,\\n\\nwell, if there's needles sticking out of your face,\\n\\nfirst of all, that must hurt.\\n\\nAnd actually the needles are very fine needles\\n\\nand skilled acupuncturists can insert them\\n\\nwithout any pain or actually the person receiving it\\n\\ndoesn't even usually recognize that the needles are in.\\n\\nThat's how quickly and efficiently they can put them in\\n\\nand people don't detect any pain.\\n\\nBut that has been shown to greatly reduce pain\\n\\nin particular headache-related pain and back-related pain\\n\\nand some other forms of pain.\\n\\nChu Fu's lab has shown\\n\\nthat the specific needle insertion sites\\n\\ncan activate the sensory pathways\\n\\nand can deactivate the sensory motor pathways.\\n\\nAnd now you're familiar with sensory neurons,\\n\\nmotor neurons and modulatory neurons\\n\\nand can modulate the activity of the pain pathways\\n\\nby way of impacting the activity\\n\\nof all sorts of different organs,\\n\\nincluding organs that give rise\\n\\nto some of the inflammatory cytokines.\\n\\nSo basically what I'm saying here\\n\\nis that thanks to thousands of years of acupuncture\\n\\nand the maps of different insertion sites,\\n\\nwe now know, or I should say people have long known\\n\\nand people in the West are starting to adopt\\n\\nthe understanding that acupuncture,\\n\\nyes indeed, it really does work for relieving pain.\\n\\nAnd laboratories both in the United States,\\n\\nwhich is Chu Fu's and elsewhere\\n\\nare starting to find the underlying mechanisms.\\n\\nAnd those mechanisms include deactivation\\n\\nof the pain pathways,\\n\\nactivation of some of the parallel pathways\\n\\nthat assist in shutting down pain\\n\\nor in relaxing the muscles\\n\\nthat are causing tension type headache,\\n\\nas well as activation of neural pathways\\n\\nthat impinge on organs that then cause\\n\\nor reduce the release of molecules into the body\\n\\nthat give us the experience of pain.\\n\\nSo reduced inflammation and in many cases,\\n\\nincreasing anti-inflammatory pathways.\\n\\nSo I just wanted to be sure to mention acupuncture\\n\\nand a little bit of mechanistic understanding\\n\\nof why acupuncture works,\\n\\nbecause indeed acupuncture is shown to be quite effective\\n\\nfor the treatment of tension type headache\\n\\nand to some extent migraine headache as well.\\n\\nSo we talked about omega-3 fatty acids.\\n\\nWe talked about essential oils.\\n\\nWe talked about acupuncture.\\n\\nSo this episode is starting to sound\\n\\nlike alternative treatments to headache, including migraine.\\n\\nBut I want to be very clear.\\n\\nThis is not about alternative treatments.\\n\\nEverything that I'm talking about here\\n\\nhas a mechanistic basis.\\n\\nAnd what we're talking about today\\n\\nare approaches to dealing with headache\\n\\nthat yes, are typically over-the-counter compounds\\n\\nor are grounded in nutrition\\n\\nor in the case of acupuncture, behavioral practices,\\n\\nbut that are not necessarily meant as replacements\\n\\nfor things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs\\n\\nor prescription drugs.\\n\\nOf course, those things can still be taken.\\n\\nMany people derive benefit from them.\\n\\nBut the goal is always, I believe, or I should hope,\\n\\nfor people to find ways\\n\\nthat they can control their health outcomes\\n\\nand reduce things like headache\\n\\nusing a minimum number of things\\n\\nthat have other side effects.\\n\\nAnd that, of course, can also include\\n\\nthe use of essential oils in conjunction\\n\\nwith things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs\\n\\nor the use of red light to offset photophobia\\n\\nin conjunction with any number of different treatments,\\n\\neither prescription or otherwise.\\n\\nSo I do want to make that clear.\\n\\nAnd I especially want to make that clear\\n\\nas I transition to the next segment\\n\\nwhere I'm going to tell you\\n\\nabout herbal treatments for migraine.\\n\\nAnd this is based on what I consider\\n\\na very comprehensive review\\n\\nof many randomized control studies.\\n\\nIndeed, the title of the paper\\n\\nis Herbal Treatments for Migraine,\\n\\na Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Studies.\\n\\nAnd this was published in 2020.\\n\\nAnd this contains an immense amount of information.\\n\\nSo we will provide a link to it\\n\\nfor those of you that really want to dive deep on this.\\n\\nIn this paper, they focus on a number of different reviews\\n\\nand analysis of data\\n\\nfocused on compounds for the treatment of migraine,\\n\\nranging from and including things like menthol\\n\\nand peppermint oil.\\n\\nSo we already covered that,\\n\\nso I won't cover that again in detail.\\n\\nBut in this review,\\n\\nthey highlight the results I referred to before\\n\\nplus other results that show that menthol\\n\\nand peppermint oil can be quite effective\\n\\nin the treatment of tension type headache,\\n\\nand in this case, migraine headache as well.\\n\\nSo that's interesting that menthol and peppermint oils\\n\\ncan be used not just to treat tension type headaches,\\n\\nbut migraine headaches as well.\\n\\nAnd they look at an enormous number\\n\\nof other types of herbal and essential oil type treatments,\\n\\neverything from coriander to citron to damask rose,\\n\\nchamomile, lavender, a bunch of things.\\n\\nSo I'm not going to go through each and every one of these\\n\\nin a lot of detail.\\n\\nWhat I've tended to do today and I'm going to do now\\n\\nis to highlight the most potent\\n\\nof these different treatments.\\n\\nAgain, menthol, peppermint oil being among the most potent.\\n\\nIn addition to that,\\n\\nthere's a particular pathway that's associated with headache.\\n\\nAnd when I say that, I mean the different types of headache,\\n\\nwhich includes the activation of this thing\\n\\nthat we call CGRP.\\n\\nCGRP, again, is involved in this calcium regulation pathway\\n\\nand leads to vasodilation of the vessels and arteries\\n\\nand capillaries in a way that can create pain\\n\\nand this feeling of pressure inside the head,\\n\\nwhich can be very uncomfortable, of course.\\n\\nNow, earlier in the episode,\\n\\nI mentioned that I was going to touch on caffeine.\\n\\nAnd so I'm going to do that now.\\n\\nNow, the reason I mentioned caffeine\\n\\nis that there's a sort of lore out there\\n\\nthat if you have a headache, drinking a cup of coffee\\n\\ncan eliminate that headache.\\n\\nA few things about that point.\\n\\nFirst of all, if you are somebody who ingests caffeine\\n\\nevery day and you do not ingest caffeine,\\n\\nyou will indeed get a headache and drinking caffeine\\n\\nwill relieve that particular headache.\\n\\nSo it's absolutely true that caffeine can relieve\\n\\nthe lack of caffeine-induced headache.\\n\\nThat's sort of a duh.\\n\\nBut that leads actually to a very important question,\\n\\nwhich is why would that be the case?\\n\\nWell, it turns out that caffeine is both a vasodilator\\n\\nand a vasoconstrictor.\\n\\nHow does it do that?\\n\\nWell, one of the main ways\\n\\nin which caffeine makes us more alert\\n\\nis that it occupies the receptors\\n\\nfor something called adenosine.\\n\\nAdenosine is a molecule that builds up in the brain and body\\n\\nmore and more the longer we've been awake.\\n\\nIt's one of the things that makes us feel sleepy.\\n\\nSo when we drink caffeine,\\n\\nthat caffeine occupies the adenosine receptor\\n\\nand the adenosine cannot have its normal effect\\n\\nof making us sleepy.\\n\\nWhen that caffeine wears off, the adenosine can bind\\n\\nand we feel sleepy.\\n\\nAdenosine is a vasodilator.\\n\\nSo when we drink caffeine,\\n\\nbecause it blocks the effects of adenosine,\\n\\nthere is a vasoconstriction\\n\\nassociated with drinking caffeine.\\n\\nSo if you have a headache that is associated\\n\\nwith excessive vasodilation and pressure in the head,\\n\\nindeed drinking some caffeine\\n\\ncan cause some vasoconstriction\\n\\nby preventing that adenosine pathway\\n\\nthat would normally lead to vasoconstriction\\n\\nand you can get some relief from that headache.\\n\\nHowever, caffeine is also a vasodilator.\\n\\nCaffeine has the ability to impinge\\n\\non the so-called NO pathway, the nitric oxide pathway,\\n\\nwhich is a nerve to blood pathway\\n\\nthat involves a few different enzymes\\n\\nthat we won't get into right now,\\n\\nbut maybe in a future episode,\\n\\nthat causes dilation of the blood vessels.\\n\\nAnd as a consequence, drinking caffeine\\n\\ncan also increase vasodilation.\\n\\nSo it's sort of a two-pronged effect.\\n\\nNow, one of the ways in which you might think about this\\n\\nand perhaps utilize this is that if you are well rested\\n\\nor if it's early in the day\\n\\nand you've had some sleep the previous night,\\n\\nadenosine levels are very likely to be low,\\n\\nespecially if you slept very well the night before.\\n\\nUnder those conditions, when you ingest caffeine,\\n\\nyou are not going to experience\\n\\nthe vasoconstriction effects of caffeine\\n\\nthat would ordinarily be there by inhibiting adenosine.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nBecause adenosine is not present at all.\\n\\nAnd under those conditions, drinking coffee\\n\\nought to lead to some vasodilation.\\n\\nNot a lot, but nonetheless vasodilation.\\n\\nIf, however, you haven't slept well or it's late in the day\\n\\nand you've been up for a long time,\\n\\ndrinking caffeine is likely to have more\\n\\nof a vasoconstriction effect.\\n\\nAnd this is important because some of the treatments\\n\\nthat you hear about that involve using caffeine\\n\\nto treat headache are as extreme as,\\n\\nokay, if you have a headache at night,\\n\\ndrink a cup of coffee and then go to sleep.\\n\\nI actually saw that in the literature,\\n\\nwhich I couldn't quite believe,\\n\\nbecause yes, indeed, some people can fall asleep\\n\\nafter drinking caffeine, but we know very well,\\n\\nthanks to the beautiful work and science communications\\n\\nof people like Dr. Matthew Walker\\n\\nfrom University of California, Berkeley,\\n\\nand who's been a guest on this and many other podcasts,\\n\\nthat even if you can fall asleep after drinking caffeine,\\n\\ningesting caffeine within the 10 to 12 hours\\n\\nprior to bedtime is simply not a good idea\\n\\nbecause of the ways it disrupts the architecture of sleep.\\n\\nSo what's the takeaway about caffeine\\n\\nand headache and vasodilation?\\n\\nYou need to be very clear on whether or not\\n\\ncaffeine tends to remove your headache or exacerbate it.\\n\\nNow, this is going to depend on time of day\\n\\nand the amount of adenosine in your system,\\n\\nas I mentioned before, but also,\\n\\nthere seems to be a kind of bimodal distribution\\n\\nwhereby some people, when they drink caffeine,\\n\\nit really improves their headache.\\n\\nIt's, in some cases, a very significant effect,\\n\\nwhereas other people, when they drink caffeine,\\n\\nit really exacerbates their headache.\\n\\nAnd at least as far as I could tell from the literature,\\n\\nit's not easy to predict who those people are going to be.\\n\\nWhat is reassuring, however,\\n\\nis it does not seem to be the case\\n\\nthat if you're somebody who experiences relief from headaches\\n\\nby drinking caffeine,\\n\\nthat suddenly one day to the next,\\n\\nyou're going to experience a worsening of your headache\\n\\nand vice versa is also true.\\n\\nSo if you're somebody that drinks caffeine\\n\\nand your headaches get worse,\\n\\nI don't think there's any reason to think that caffeine\\n\\none day or from one day to the next, rather,\\n\\nis going to somehow alleviate your headache.\\n\\nSo you have to determine for yourself\\n\\nwhether or not headaches are relieved\\n\\nor exacerbated by drinking caffeine.\\n\\nAnd if you're wondering why it's so confusing,\\n\\nit's because caffeine hits both the vasodilation\\n\\nand the vasoconstriction pathways,\\n\\nand there's nothing you or I\\n\\nor anyone else can do about it.\\n\\nNow, the last thing I'd like to talk about\\n\\nin terms of relief for headaches\\n\\nis something that I'm guessing about\\n\\nprobably 25% of you are familiar with\\n\\nand 75% of you are not, which is curcumin.\\n\\nCurcumin is often also referred to as turmeric.\\n\\nAnd turmeric is a root,\\n\\nand curcumin is one of the key components of that root.\\n\\nCurcumin is known to have\\n\\nvery potent anti-inflammatory properties.\\n\\nI don't think that's debated at all.\\n\\nIn fact, it's so potent as an anti-inflammatory\\n\\nthat some people have cautioned against taking\\n\\nhigh levels of curcumin prior to, for instance,\\n\\nresistance training workouts or even cardiovascular workouts\\n\\nbecause it so prevents inflammation\\n\\nthat it also can prevent the adaptation response.\\n\\nBecause remember, the inflammation that occurs\\n\\nduring exercise, both resistance and cardiovascular exercise\\n\\nis at least in part the trigger for the adaptation\\n\\nthat it's going to lead to enhanced endurance,\\n\\nenhanced strength, hypertrophy, et cetera.\\n\\nNonetheless, curcumin has been explored\\n\\nin the context of treatment of migraine.\\n\\nAnd it's one of the compounds that was analyzed\\n\\nin extensive detail in this wonderful review\\n\\nthat I mentioned a little bit earlier.\\n\\nWhat I like about this study is that they were able to\\n\\nexplore the effects of curcumin\\n\\nas explored in previous research studies\\n\\nand compare those across a large range\\n\\nof different dosages and a large range of combinations\\n\\nwith other things like coenzyme Q10,\\n\\nwhich we've talked about on this podcast before.\\n\\nBut I think for sake of this discussion,\\n\\njust really focusing on what curcumin does alone\\n\\nor in conjunction with the omega-3 fatty acids\\n\\nis what turns out to be the most interesting.\\n\\nFirst of all, curcumin has been shown to be\\n\\ngenerally safe for most people.\\n\\nAt dosages as high as 8,000 milligrams per day\\n\\nor eight grams per day.\\n\\nNow, I want to be very clear.\\n\\nI do not recommend that anyone take dosages of curcumin,\\n\\nAKA tumeric, that are that high.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nWell, curcumin and tumeric not only are anti-inflammatory,\\n\\nbut they also can impinge on other pathways\\n\\nin particular hormonal pathways.\\n\\nAnd in fact, curcumin, AKA tumeric,\\n\\ncan alter the synthesis\\n\\nof something called dihydrotestosterone.\\n\\nDihydrotestosterone is involved in an enormous range\\n\\nof different bodily functions.\\n\\nIt's involved in libido.\\n\\nIt's involved in men and beard growth\\n\\nand in the regulation of a number of different tissues,\\n\\nboth in the reproductive axis\\n\\nand outside the reproductive axis.\\n\\nAnd curcumin is a potent inhibitor of DHT.\\n\\nSo I do want to caution that people who take high doses\\n\\nof curcumin and some people who are very sensitive\\n\\nto curcumin will even at low doses experience reductions\\n\\nin DHT that lead to things that they would not like,\\n\\nsuch as sufficient reductions in libido.\\n\\nHowever, curcumin has been shown to be effective\\n\\nas an anti-inflammatory and has been shown\\n\\nto be very effective in treating different types of headache\\n\\nand particular migraine headache.\\n\\nOne of the ways in which curcumin does that is to inhibit\\n\\nthis thing that I talked about a few minutes ago,\\n\\nwhich is nitric oxide or NO, which causes vasodilation.\\n\\nAnd in doing that can reduce the feeling\\n\\nthat one has a lot of intracranial pressure.\\n\\nSo curcumin dosages come in an enormous range,\\n\\nas I mentioned before,\\n\\ndosages that range anywhere from 80 milligrams taken,\\n\\n80 milligrams per day, that is,\\n\\ntaken for eight weeks time.\\n\\nThat's been examined.\\n\\nIt's been explored at 80 milligram dosages\\n\\ntaken alongside two and a half grams\\n\\nof omega-3 fatty acids or omega-3 fatty acids alone\\n\\nand against placebo.\\n\\nAnd the general conclusion of these studies\\n\\nis that curcumin when taken at dosages of about 80 milligrams,\\n\\nalthough for those of you very sensitive to curcumin,\\n\\nprobably as low as 25 or even 50 milligrams per day\\n\\nin conjunction with,\\n\\nalthough not necessarily at the same time,\\n\\nbut taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids\\n\\nat two and a half grams per day\\n\\nled to significant improvements in migraine\\n\\nand other forms of headache,\\n\\nmeaning both the frequency and the intensity\\n\\nof the headaches that occurred was greatly reduced.\\n\\nOne important point about curcumin to keep in mind\\n\\nis that curcumin is known to inhibit something\\n\\ncalled cytochrome P450.\\n\\nThat's associated with an enzymatic pathway\\n\\nand some other things that relate to blood coagulation.\\n\\nSo for people that are taking medications\\n\\nthat are anti-coagulants to prevent clotting,\\n\\nyou do need to be very cautious about using curcumin.\\n\\nAnd of course, with curcumin or any other supplement,\\n\\nyou should always talk to your doctor prior to including it\\n\\nor removing it from your supplement regimen.\\n\\nSo as you can see,\\n\\nthere are a number of different things\\n\\nthat in addition to prescription drugs\\n\\nand over-the-counter pain medications,\\n\\nthings like non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs,\\n\\ncan really impact the different aspects of headache\\n\\nand different types of headache,\\n\\nin some cases differentially.\\n\\nNow, today we talked mainly about tension type\\n\\nand migraine type headaches,\\n\\nbecause those are the most common forms of headache.\\n\\nThere are, of course, the cluster type headaches\\n\\nthat are of neural origin.\\n\\nTalked about hormonal headaches\\n\\nand indeed some treatments such as omega-3s,\\n\\nwhich have been shown to be beneficial\\n\\nfor offsetting the menstrual related headaches.\\n\\nNow, in the context of the discussion about omega-3s,\\n\\nkeep in mind that omega-3s can be obtained\\n\\nfrom supplementation or from nutrition.\\n\\nSo you don't necessarily have to take omega-3 capsules\\n\\nor liquid form omega-3s if you want to use omega-3s\\n\\nto target different symptoms of headache.\\n\\nBut that probably is going to be the most efficient way\\n\\nto do it, given that many foods do contain omega-3s,\\n\\nbut it's hard to get above that one gram dosage.\\n\\nAnd in fact, most of the studies that we talked\\n\\nabout today involved getting two or even two and a half,\\n\\nor in some cases on this podcast with previous guests,\\n\\nsuch as Dr. Rhonda Patrick,\\n\\nshe talked about the advantages of getting as high\\n\\nas three grams of omega-3s per day,\\n\\nwhich almost with certainty is going to require\\n\\nsome external form of supplementation,\\n\\neven for those of you that are making a point\\n\\nto eat fatty ocean fish with the skin on.\\n\\nSo I just want to make sure that I highlight that.\\n\\nBefore we wrap up, I can't help myself,\\n\\nbut to talk about something\\n\\nthat I heard about on the news several years ago,\\n\\nand it sounded too outrageous to be true,\\n\\nbut then was confirmed as accurate\\n\\nby one of my neurologist colleagues.\\n\\nAnd that's the fact that eating certain very spicy peppers\\n\\ncan induce headache,\\n\\nand in some cases can induce brain damage.\\n\\nAnd bear with me here,\\n\\nI'm not talking about your traditional jalapeno,\\n\\nand I'm acknowledging the fact that certain people\\n\\ncan tolerate far more spicy tastes than do others.\\n\\nSome people are very sensitive to spicy,\\n\\nsome people can tolerate very spicy food,\\n\\nand that one can build up a tolerance to spicy food\\n\\nby ingesting progressively your spicier, excuse me,\\n\\nspicier and spicier foods over time.\\n\\nNonetheless, there are these pepper eating contests\\n\\nout there that while not very common do exist,\\n\\nand people challenge each other to eat peppers\\n\\nof extreme spiciness.\\n\\nAnd there's one in particular that's referred to\\n\\nas the Carolina Reaper.\\n\\nBy the way, that's not a person as far as I know,\\n\\nthat's a pepper, the Carolina Reaper,\\n\\nwhich is known to have the most potent spice of any pepper.\\n\\nAnd here's why you would not want to eat\\n\\nthe Carolina Reaper.\\n\\nA few years ago at one of these pepper eating contests,\\n\\na man ate a Carolina Reaper as part of the competition,\\n\\nand suddenly experienced what's called Thunderclap headache.\\n\\nThunderclap headache is a unique type of headache,\\n\\nvery different from all the other types of headaches.\\n\\nIt is not from the surface in, so it's not tension headache.\\n\\nIt's not even the cluster type headache\\n\\nof the nerve activation of the trigeminal.\\n\\nIt's actually a hyper constriction of the vasculature\\n\\nin the brain caused by the ingestion of the pepper,\\n\\nan inflammatory response.\\n\\nAnd remember that heat and spicy go together\\n\\nin these neural pathways,\\n\\nand a bunch of different heat-related\\n\\nand spice-related pathways get activated simultaneously\\n\\nwhen one ingests something of extreme spice.\\n\\nAnd the blood vessels,\\n\\nand indeed some of the smaller arteries\\n\\nfeeding neural tissue shut down,\\n\\nand he experienced this Thunderclap headache,\\n\\nwhich is a brutal headache,\\n\\nand sadly, in his case, permanent brain damage,\\n\\nso loss of neuronal tissue,\\n\\nbecause neuronal tissue is very metabolically active.\\n\\nYou cut off the blood supply to that tissue.\\n\\nNot only would you feel miserable, maybe even pass out,\\n\\nbut lose vision, and certain brain areas\\n\\nwill actually die off in the absence\\n\\nof a blood flow to those areas.\\n\\nWe know this more commonly as stroke.\\n\\nSo I don't want to strike fear in anybody\\n\\nabout eating a jalapeno,\\n\\nor even a very spicy meal from time to time.\\n\\nBut if you're not somebody who's familiar\\n\\nwith eating very spicy foods,\\n\\nyou certainly don't want to enter one of these competitions\\n\\nand just realize that the pathways\\n\\nfrom menthol and cool or spicy and hot,\\n\\nthose aren't just subjective pathways.\\n\\nThese are actually neural pathways\\n\\nthat, again, originate in our so-called,\\n\\nnerds call it the sensory epithelium,\\n\\nso our skin, our hearing, our eyes,\\n\\nand that feed that information into the body\\n\\nto make use of that information,\\n\\nsome case motor movements, so sensory motor.\\n\\nIn other cases, the information can be fed\\n\\nthrough nerve pathways that goes to the vasculature\\n\\nand causes the vasculature to either dilate or constrict\\n\\nthese very spicy peppers causing, as I just mentioned,\\n\\nextreme cerebro of the head,\\n\\nvasoconstriction and brain damage.\\n\\nAgain, that's not going to be a common thing out there,\\n\\nbut nonetheless, I encourage people\\n\\nto be very cautious about the Carolina Reaper.\\n\\nSo today we talked about headaches,\\n\\nand first we highlighted the different types of headache,\\n\\nmaking it clear that understanding\\n\\nwhich headache you might be experiencing\\n\\ncan be very beneficial for understanding\\n\\nwhich sorts of treatments ought to be best,\\n\\nand perhaps also best avoided,\\n\\nin trying to alleviate those headaches\\n\\nor prevent them from happening at all.\\n\\nWe talked about tension headaches,\\n\\nmigraine headaches, hormone-based headaches,\\n\\ncluster headaches,\\n\\nand traumatic brain injury-related headaches.\\n\\nWe talked about different types of treatments\\n\\nranging from creatine to omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,\\n\\nsome herbal and indeed some essential oil treatments\\n\\nas well as acupuncture, all of which have been shown\\n\\nto have significant impact in reducing the frequency\\n\\nand intensity of headaches.\\n\\nAnd in many cases, reductions in the frequency\\n\\nand intensity of headaches that are at least as great\\n\\nas the results that are seen\\n\\nwith non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs.\\n\\nAgain, I want to highlight that none of these approaches\\n\\nare necessarily designed to be done on their own\\n\\nor in replacement of prescription drugs from your physician.\\n\\nThere are excellent prescription drugs out there\\n\\nthat your physician can prescribe for you\\n\\nfor the treatment of headache.\\n\\nNonetheless, I think many people\\n\\nwho are listeners of this podcast\\n\\nare interested in the things that they can do\\n\\nin order to inoculate themselves\\n\\nor at least reduce the likelihood\\n\\nof experiencing headache,\\n\\nespecially for people who are experiencing\\n\\nchronic recurring headaches such as migraine\\n\\nor the other forms of headache,\\n\\nwhich can be so debilitating.\\n\\nThank you for joining me for today's discussion.\\n\\nIf you're learning from and or enjoying this

       " Document(page_content=\"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\n\\nwhere we discuss science\\n\\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\\n\\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\\n\\nand I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology\\n\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\n\\nToday, we are discussing music and your brain.\\n\\nHowever, this episode could have just as easily\\n\\nbeen entitled, music is your brain,\\n\\nor your brain is music.\\n\\nAnd that's because music, believe it or not,\\n\\nis a neurological phenomenon.\\n\\nMost of us think of music as something\\n\\nthat happens outside of us,\\n\\nthe sounds we hear, the lyrics we hear,\\n\\ntheir meaning, how they anchor us to pieces of our history,\\n\\nboth emotional or social.\\n\\nIt turns out that when we listen to music,\\n\\nit activates nearly every piece of our brain.\\n\\nMoreover, when we listen to music,\\n\\nit activates our brain in ways that our brain itself,\\n\\nand indeed our body as well,\\n\\nhelp to create that music\\n\\nat the level of so-called neuro-ensemble,\\n\\nthat is the firing of neurons.\\n\\nIn other words, when we listen to music,\\n\\nour brain and our body become part of the instrument\\n\\nthat contributes to our perception of that music.\\n\\nToday, I'm going to make clear how all of that happens.\\n\\nWe will also discuss how music can be leveraged\\n\\ntowards shifting our brain states and our bodily states.\\n\\nFor instance, what sorts of music to listen to\\n\\nin order to make ourselves happy.\\n\\nYes, studies have been done on that,\\n\\nas well as how long to listen to music\\n\\nin order to shift our mood or our overall bodily state,\\n\\nincluding how to process feelings of sadness.\\n\\nMany of you are probably familiar with particular songs\\n\\nthat anchor us to particular times in our history\\n\\nor people in our history.\\n\\nAnd there's an age-old question really\\n\\nas to whether or not listening to sad music\\n\\ncan help us process our feelings of sadness\\n\\nor whether or not they drive us further down the spiral\\n\\nof sadness and despair.\\n\\nAnd indeed studies have explored this as well.\\n\\nSo today I will explain how music,\\n\\nindeed how different types of music\\n\\nactivate different neural circuits in your brain\\n\\nto create different brain and bodily states,\\n\\nhow we can leverage music toward things\\n\\nlike emotional processing, shifting our emotions,\\n\\nas well as to enhance learning and memory.\\n\\nAnd we will also talk about the use of music\\n\\nto enhance brain plasticity,\\n\\nthat is your brain's ability to change\\n\\nin response to experience,\\n\\nnot just in response to that music,\\n\\nbut rather using music as a tool\\n\\nto expand our capacity for neuroplasticity,\\n\\ngiving us the ability to learn far more\\n\\nin other contexts and areas of life.\\n\\nI confess that in researching this episode,\\n\\nI found myself continually delighted as to,\\n\\nfirst of all, how impressive the science\\n\\nof the study of music in the brain is.\\n\\nAnd secondly, how fundamental music is to all of our lives.\\n\\nAnd this is true whether or not you're somebody\\n\\nwho listens to music often,\\n\\nor you're somebody that really prefers silence.\\n\\nIndeed, we will talk about whether or not\\n\\nit's better to listen to music or remain in silence\\n\\nwhen you perform certain kinds of work.\\n\\nIt turns out that there's a very clear answer to that.\\n\\nIf you want a little bit of a hint,\\n\\nit is best to listen to music in between bouts of work\\n\\nor during brief rest periods,\\n\\nas opposed to listening to music while you work.\\n\\nAnd for those of you that listen to music while you work\\n\\nand thoroughly enjoy listening to music while you work,\\n\\nwe will also discuss what that means\\n\\nabout your brain in particular,\\n\\nbecause it's likely that it got wired up that way\\n\\nat a particular phase of development.\\n\\nAnd each and all of you can learn today\\n\\nhow to best leverage music toward productivity,\\n\\nbut perhaps equally important how to leverage music\\n\\nfor enrichment and enjoyment of life.\\n\\nI'm pleased to announce that we will be hosting\\n\\nthree live events in Australia.\\n\\nAll three events will cover science\\n\\nand science related tools for mental health,\\n\\nphysical health, and performance.\\n\\nThere will also be a live question and answer session.\\n\\nThe first live event will take place on February 10th\\n\\nin Melbourne at the Plenary Theater.\\n\\nThe second live event will take place on February 17th\\n\\nin Sydney at the Sydney Opera House.\\n\\nAnd the third event will take place on February 23rd\\n\\nin Brisbane at the Great Hall.\\n\\nTo access tickets to any of these events,\\n\\nsimply go to hubermanlab.com slash tour\\n\\nand use the code Huberman.\\n\\nI hope to see you there.\\n\\nAnd last but certainly not least,\\n\\nthank you for your interest in science.\\n\\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast\\n\\nis separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.\\n\\nIt is however, part of my desire and effort\\n\\nto bring zero cost to consumer information about science\\n\\nand science related tools to the general public.\\n\\nIn keeping with that theme,\\n\\nI'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.\\n\\nOur first sponsor is 8 Sleep.\\n\\n8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling,\\n\\nheating, and sleep tracking capacity.\\n\\nI've spoken many times before on this podcast\\n\\nabout the fact that sleep,\\n\\nthat is getting enough quality sleep each night,\\n\\nis the foundation of mental health,\\n\\nphysical health, and performance.\\n\\nOne of the key things to getting a great night's sleep\\n\\nis to make sure that your body temperature drops\\n\\nby about one to three degrees at the beginning of the night.\\n\\nIndeed, that is how your body falls\\n\\nand stays deeply asleep.\\n\\nAs well, in order to wake up in the morning\\n\\nfeeling refreshed, your bodily temperature needs to increase\\n\\nby about one to three degrees.\\n\\n8 Sleep mattress covers make it extremely easy\\n\\nto control the temperature of your sleeping environment,\\n\\nallowing you to fall and stay deeply asleep\\n\\nthroughout the night and to wake up feeling refreshed.\\n\\nI started sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover\\n\\nwell over two years ago,\\n\\nand it has completely transformed my sleep.\\n\\nIt's allowed me to fall asleep more quickly.\\n\\nIt's allowed me to sleep more deeply throughout the night.\\n\\nAnd if I happen to wake up during the middle of the night,\\n\\nsomething that's perfectly normal to do once or even twice,\\n\\nI fall back asleep far more quickly\\n\\nand I wake up feeling refreshed.\\n\\nAs a consequence, my mood focus and alertness\\n\\nthroughout the day is greatly elevated\\n\\nas compared to prior to sleeping\\n\\non my 8 Sleep mattress cover.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try an 8 Sleep mattress cover,\\n\\nyou can go to 8sleep.com slash Huberman\\n\\nto save $150 off their Pod 3 cover.\\n\\n8

makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\\n\\nthat are the absolute highest quality.\\n\\nI've spent a lifetime working\\n\\non the biology of the visual system,\\n\\nand I can tell you that your visual system has to contend\\n\\nwith an enormous number of challenges\\n\\nin order for you to be able to see clearly\\n\\nin different environments.\\n\\nRoca understands the biology of the visual system\\n\\nand has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses\\n\\nso that you always see with crystal clarity.\\n\\nOriginally, their glasses were designed for performance,\\n\\nthat is for running and cycling and for sport.\\n\\nAnd indeed, they can still be used for performance.\\n\\nThey won't slip off your face if you get sweaty,\\n\\nthey're extremely lightweight.\\n\\nBut I should mention that Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses\\n\\ncome in some of the aesthetics more typically associated\\n\\nwith performance glasses, like those cyborg style glasses,\\n\\nbut they also have a number of styles\\n\\nthat you would be perfectly comfortable wearing out\\n\\nto dinner or to work.\\n\\nI wear readers at night or when I drive,\\n\\nand I wear sunglasses during the day\\n\\nif I happen to be driving into bright light or outside,\\n\\nand it's just overwhelmingly bright.\\n\\nI do not wear sunglasses when I do my morning sunlight viewing\\n\\nto set my circadian rhythm,\\n\\nand I suggest that you do the same.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,\\n\\nyou can go to roca, R-O-K-A.com,\\n\\nand enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first

back\\n\\nand acknowledge something that is absolutely remarkable\\n\\nabout music, which is if you think about language,\\n\\nI could describe to you a glass,\\n\\nI could describe to you an apple,\\n\\nI could describe to you a story,\\n\\nI could describe to you a face,\\n\\nI could describe to you any number of different things,\\n\\nand you could do the same for me.\\n\\nLanguage is essentially infinite\\n\\nin the number of things that it can explain,\\n\\nand the ways that it can explain it.\\n\\nAnd yet, if you think about music,\\n\\nmusic, provided there are no lyrics in that music,\\n\\ncan't explain how a glass is shaped.\\n\\nIt can't even tell you that there's a glass present\\n\\nin the room or on a table.\\n\\nIt can't tell you what a face looks like.\\n\\nIt can't tell you what that person\\n\\nwho owns that face did or is doing.\\n\\nSo in some ways, you might think, wow,\\n\\nmusic is fairly diminished in terms of its qualitative depth\\n\\ncompared to language.\\n\\nAnd yet, if you take a step back\\n\\nand think about what music can do,\\n\\nit's astonishing and it actually overwhelms\\n\\nwhat language can do.\\n\\nWhat can music do?\\n\\nWell, even in the absence of any lyrics,\\n\\nany words put to music, music can describe an emotion.\\n\\nIn fact, music can describe numerous types of emotions,\\n\\nand it can do it with a lot of nuance.\\n\\nSo not just displaying for us happy or sad,\\n\\nbut rather different degrees of happiness,\\n\\ndifferent degrees of sadness.\\n\\nMusic can be used to convey a sense of longing,\\n\\na sense of nostalgia, a sense of delight,\\n\\na sense of awe, and on and on.\\n\\nSo whereas music can't describe nouns very well,\\n\\nit can beautifully describe emotions.\\n\\nAnd not only can music describe emotions\\n\\nwith a tremendous degree of nuance,\\n\\nmusic can evoke emotions with a tremendous degree of nuance.\\n\\nNow, this is spectacular,\\n\\nand it's not only spectacular, it is important,\\n\\nbecause as we move through today's episode,\\n\\nyou'll soon come to realize that it's very likely,\\n\\nand indeed, we have a lot of scientific evidence\\n\\nto support the fact that music evolved prior\\n\\nto spoken language.\\n\\nMoreover, it's very likely that singing evolved\\n\\nprior to spoken language,\\n\\nand that music, singing, and dance together\\n\\nevolved prior to language.\\n\\nMaking music as well as singing and dance,\\n\\nbut really just music even on its own\\n\\nin the absence of any lyrics or any bodily movement\\n\\nas the fundamental form of human communication.\\n\\nIndeed, music can evoke empathy.\\n\\nAgain, we're talking about music\\n\\nin the absence of any lyrics.\\n\\nAnd when I say music can evoke empathy,\\n\\nI'm not talking about the sort of empathy\\n\\nwhere you look at somebody and nod and understand\\n\\nso-called cognitive empathy,\\n\\nwhich is important, by the way, in relational dynamics,\\n\\nor emotional empathy,\\n\\nwhere you're actually feeling\\n\\nwhat the other person is feeling,\\n\\nbut of course, you never really know\\n\\nwhat somebody else is feeling, how could you?\\n\\nYou can only have a sense of what they might be feeling,\\n\\nand you have a sense of what you're feeling,\\n\\nbut let's be honest,\\n\\nas one of our prior guests on the Huberman Lab podcast,\\n\\nDr. Karl Deisseroth, so aptly noted,\\n\\nrarely do we ever understand how anyone else truly feels,\\n\\nbecause indeed, rarely do we ever understand\\n\\nhow we ourselves truly feel.\\n\\nAnd certainly with language,\\n\\nit's very hard to explain our feelings with words\\n\\nin a way that can convey the way that we feel\\n\\nwith the kind of nuance that represents our own reality.\\n\\nEven in a state of extreme happiness or extreme sadness,\\n\\nwords fall short of explaining how we feel inside.\\n\\nAnd yet, as I mentioned earlier,\\n\\nmusic not only can describe emotions,\\n\\nit can evoke emotions within us.\\n\\nAnd in doing so, it can evoke emotions\\n\\nthat give us a sense of empathy\\n\\nfor the person playing the music,\\n\\nor simply for others in the world,\\n\\nand music can do that so powerfully\\n\\nbecause not only does music come in through our ears,\\n\\nand we'll talk about the process of how sound is converted\\n\\ninto what we perceive as music in a little bit,\\n\\nbecause indeed, it comes in through our ears,\\n\\nand we can hear that music, of course,\\n\\nbut the nerve cells, the neurons in your brain,\\n\\nas well as the nerve cells in your body,\\n\\ncan become activated by music\\n\\nin a way that the firing of those neurons,\\n\\nliterally the frequency of those neural impulses\\n\\ncomes to match the frequency of the sounds\\n\\nthat you're hearing in your outside environment.\\n\\nIn other words, when you listen to music,\\n\\nnot only is that music coming into your body\\n\\nthrough your sense organs, your hearing,\\n\\nbut your body itself is an instrument\\n\\nplaying that music from within.\\n\\nSo for instance, if you listen to a piece of music\\n\\nthat has a lightness to it, that evokes a sense in you\\n\\nof the turning of the seasons from winter to spring,\\n\\nsomething that's common in certain classical music,\\n\\nbut other forms of music as well.\\n\\nWhen you hear that music, indeed,\\n\\nit's coming in through your ears,\\n\\nbut also the firing of the neurons in your brain and body\\n\\nresponding to those particular frequencies of sound\\n\\nis such that your body itself is an instrument\\n\\nplaying that sense of the turning of the seasons\\n\\nfrom winter to spring within you,\\n\\nwhich is why your body starts to feel lifted in some cases,\\n\\nor it starts to feel a lightness in some cases,\\n\\nand an entire set of emotions starts to be recruited\\n\\nthat at least for you resemble the turning of the seasons\\n\\nfrom winter to spring.\\n\\nNow that may sound rather complex,\\n\\nbut we're going to break that process down\\n\\ninto its component parts.\\n\\nBut what I essentially just said\\n\\nis that when you listen to music,\\n\\nnot only are you hearing that music,\\n\\nbut your body, that is your neurons,\\n\\nand indeed your hormones as well,\\n\\nthings like oxytocin and some other hormones\\n\\nin your brain and body that we'll discuss\\n\\nare contributing to a symphony of emotion\\n\\nfrom within your body and brain.\\n\\nOkay, so while music can't explain objects,\\n\\nit can't describe them,\\n\\nit can explain in a very nuanced ways, emotions,\\n\\nand it can evoke emotions within us.\\n\\nNow, if that's not amazing enough,\\n\\nmusic can not only describe and evoke emotions,\\n\\nit can also imply intent.\\n\\nThink for instance about drumming\\n\\nthat you would hear off in the distance,\\n\\nand we're not talking about\\n\\nrat-tat-tat-tat-tat, rat-tat-tat-tat.\\n\\nWe're talking drumming of this sort,\\n\\ndoom, doom, doom.\\n\\nAnd perhaps the cadence of that drumming changes\\n\\nsuch that as it's approaching,\\n\\nit gets more and more frequent,\\n\\ndoom, doom, doom.\\n\\nWhat is the intent being implied?\\n\\nWell, we know from numerous studies,\\n\\nand you know from numerous movies that you've seen\\n\\nand heard that that sort of low-frequency drumming\\n\\nof increasing cadence as it approaches\\n\\nis implying the intent of aggression or war,\\n\\nor at least is implying that something serious\\n\\nis going to happen.\\n\\nNow contrast that with a different frequency of sound\\n\\nplayed at a higher cadence.\\n\\nDa-da-da-dum, da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-dum.\\n\\nNow, the second set of tones, da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-dum,\\n\\nare far less clear in terms of what they mean,\\n\\nwhat their intent is.\\n\\nBut if we contrast them with,\\n\\nlet's just call them what they're typically called,\\n\\nthe war drums or the drums that convey a sense\\n\\nof aggressive intent, doom, doom, doom.\\n\\nWhat we create then is a juxtaposition\\n\\nof two different emotional states in you perhaps,\\n\\nor maybe you don't respond to those\\n\\nwith any robust emotional shift,\\n\\nbut we are conveying two separate\\n\\nor distinct sets of intent.\\n\\nNow, of course, spoken language can convey intent.\\n\\nI could say, for instance, you know, I'm going to help you.\\n\\nHow can I help you today?\\n\\nOr I could say, I'm going to hurt you, right?\\n\\nOf course, with spoken language, you could do that,\\n\\nand you could change the intonation of that language,\\n\\nyou could change the frequency.\\n\\nSo if I were to say, I'm going to hurt you,\\n\\nit's very different than if I say, I'm going to hurt you.\\n\\nOkay, or if I put it as a question, I'm going to hurt you.\\n\\nOkay, so with language, of course,\\n\\nthere's also the opportunity for a lot of nuance,\\n\\ndepending on where the inflections,\\n\\nwhere the accents are on a particular phrase,\\n\\neven a particular word.\\n\\nBut with music, as you recall,\\n\\nwhen we convey a sense of intent,\\n\\nwe are also conveying that sense of intent\\n\\nthrough the body of the listener,\\n\\nnot just bringing it in through their ears.\\n\\nAnd so when we do that, what we do is we start to recruit\\n\\na huge number of neural circuits that are involved,\\n\\nnot just in understanding or a sense of empathy\\n\\nfor an emotion, but rather that can recruit movement\\n\\nor what we call pre-motor circuits in the body.\\n\\nPre-motor circuits are the neurons that start to fire\\n\\nbefore a particular pattern of action is generated.\\n\\nAnd so when we hear music that conveys emotion,\\n\\nthat evokes emotion, and especially when we hear music\\n\\nthat conveys a sense of intent from the outside,\\n\\nwe too start to feel as if we need to move or respond\\n\\nto that music in a particular way.\\n\\nNow, what I just described to you\\n\\nis not something that's learned.\\n\\nIn fact, it is innate.\\n\\nHow do we know that?\\n\\nWell, there are some beautiful studies\\n\\nthat have explored how babies respond to music.\\n\\nIndeed, how babies respond to specific types of music,\\n\\nspecific frequencies of sound,\\n\\nspacing between particular notes, and on and on.\\n\\nIt's been demonstrated, for instance,\\n\\nthat babies as young as three months old\\n\\nrespond to music very differently than they respond\\n\\nto just other forms of sound scrambled in time.\\n\\nNow, of course, babies that are three months old\\n\\naren't speaking, so you could ask them,\\n\\ndoes that sound like music?\\n\\nHow does it make you feel, et cetera?\\n\\nThey're not going to answer,\\n\\nat least not with any coherence\\n\\nbecause they don't have spoken language yet.\\n\\nBut despite their absence of language,\\n\\nwe know that babies as young as three months old\\n\\nrespond to music because they do so\\n\\nwith rhythmic movements of their bodily limbs\\n\\nand actually their torso as well.\\n\\nNow, a little bit later, we will touch on this issue\\n\\nof what types of music evoke movement of the torso\\n\\nversus movement of the limbs\\n\\nversus movement of the torso and limbs.\\n\\nNo, I'm not going to dance for you during this podcast.\\n\\nHowever, there's a really interesting story there\\n\\nthat relates to how primitive or evolved the motor neurons,\\n\\nthe neurons that actually move the musculature are\\n\\nand how primitive or evolved the music\\n\\nthat one listens to is.\\n\\nBut just to give you a sense of where that's headed,\\n\\nin this study where they examined the responses\\n\\nof very young babies to music,\\n\\nwhat they found is that certain frequencies of sound\\n\\nevoked movements in those babies that were rhythmic,\\n\\nwhere it was mostly their torso moving back and forth\\n\\nand maybe their head a little bit.\\n\\nWhereas other patterns of sound,\\n\\ndifferent frequencies in different arrangements,\\n\\nevoked movement of their limbs more than their torso\\n\\nand still other patterns of sounds evoked movement\\n\\nof their torso, limbs and head.\\n\\nIn other words, babies dancing.\\n\\nAnd if you've ever been to a wedding or a party\\n\\nor been out dancing, you will see people\\n\\nwho include more torso versus limb\\n\\nversus limb and torso movement when they dance.\\n\\nAnd yes, of course, some of this relates to proficiency\\n\\nin dancing, comfort on the dance floor, et cetera.\\n\\nBut there are some universal rules out there\\n\\nabout how certain frequencies and patterns of sound,\\n\\nAKA music, evokes different types of bodily movements.\\n\\nSo starting from a very young age,\\n\\nprior to any instruction in terms of how to dance\\n\\nor what music is, babies are dancing to music.\\n\\nAnd that highlights an important point\\n\\nthat we will return to again and again\\n\\nthroughout today's episode,\\n\\nwhich is that the systems of the brain\\n\\nthat respond specifically to movement, not just sound,\\n\\nbut specifically to musical sounds\\n\\nare intimately tied to the neural circuits of the body\\n\\nthat generate movement.\\n\\nAnd this is especially important to understand\\n\\nwhen we get into our discussion about music\\n\\nand our sense of motivation.\\n\\nOkay, so the list of incredible things\\n\\nthat music can evoke within us\\n\\nby way of how it activates our nervous system and body\\n\\nis starting to grow.\\n\\nWe've talked about how music can convey emotion,\\n\\nhow music can evoke emotion\\n\\nand how music can convey a sense of intent,\\n\\nas well now as how music can generate action within us.\\n\\nThis is a pretty spectacular list if you think about it.\\n\\nIn addition, music causes changes\\n\\nwithin our bodily physiology\\n\\nthat extends beyond the nervous system,\\n\\nalthough it has a relationship to the nervous system.\\n\\nIn particular, there've been a lot of studies\\n\\nthat have explored how music changes things\\n\\nlike our blood pressure\\n\\nor how fast our heart is beating,\\n\\nour so-called resting heart rate.\\n\\nAnd here we've made some important discoveries\\n\\nin recent years.\\n\\nAnd when I say we, I don't mean my laboratory.\\n\\nI mean, laboratories that focus on the relationship\\n\\nbetween music and our bodily physiology.\\n\\nBecause we've long known\\n\\nthat music can change various health metrics.\\n\\nThere's some really nice studies,\\n\\nand I'll link to one or two of the meta-analyses\\n\\nof these studies in the show note captions\\n\\nthat have showed that if people listen to anywhere\\n\\nfrom 10 to 30 minutes of music per day,\\n\\nand by the way, the selection of music in these studies\\n\\nranged everything from rock and roll\\n\\nto classical music, to country music.\\n\\nTypically, these studies would ask subjects\\n\\nwhat their favorite music is.\\n\\nAnd then they would have them listen\\n\\nto that particular genre of music\\n\\nfor anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes per day.\\n\\nAnd if you look at the meta-analyses of those studies,\\n\\nwhat you find is that almost all of them\\n\\nsee some sort of significant effect.\\n\\nThat is some statistically significant shift\\n\\nin the bodily physiology of people\\n\\nthat deliberately listen to music\\n\\nfor 10 to 30 minutes per day.\\n\\nNot while doing anything else,\\n\\nbut just listening to that music.\\n\\nThey find, for instance,\\n\\nthat their resting heart rate is reduced.\\n\\nIf not during the period in which they're listening\\n\\nto the music, then after the time\\n\\nin which they're listening to the music,\\n\\nthey find that their so-called heart rate variability\\n\\ntends to increase.\\n\\nFor those of you that aren't familiar\\n\\nwith heart rate variability,\\n\\nhaving increased heart rate variability is a good thing.\\n\\nAnd that's because heart rate variability\\n\\nreflects the sort of push and pull,\\n\\nor the balance rather, of the activation\\n\\nof the so-called sympathetic nervous system,\\n\\nwhich is the one sometimes called the fight or flight system,\\n\\nalthough I don't really like that nomenclature.\\n\\nThe sympathetic nervous system,\\n\\nby the way, is not about emotional sympathy.\\n\\nIt's what drives your heart rate higher.\\n\\nIt tends to put us into activated states\\n\\nwhere we favor movement and motion and makes us alert.\\n\\nWhereas the parasympathetic aspect of our nervous system\\n\\nis the portion of our autonomic nervous system,\\n\\nsometimes called the rest and digest system.\\n\\nThe parasympathetic nervous system\\n\\ndrives states of deeper relaxation, of calm.\\n\\nIn any event, heart rate variability\\n\\nreflects a periodic breaking,\\n\\na slowing down of heart rate and breathing\\n\\nand other aspects of our neural system function\\n\\nthat works alongside with sympathetic activation.\\n\\nThink of sympathetic activation as an accelerator,\\n\\nparasympathetic activation as a break.\\n\\nAnd when heart rate variability is higher,\\n\\nit reflects the fact\\n\\nthat our parasympathetic nervous system\\n\\nis periodically engaging.\\n\\nIt's getting activated and slowing our heart rate,\\n\\nslowing our breathing down.\\n\\nMusic seems to have the effect\\n\\nof activating that parasympathetic aspect\\n\\nof our nervous system.\\n\\nAnd so we are pumping the break every once in a while,\\n\\nslowing down our heart rate, slowing down our breathing.\\n\\nIn other words, when people listen to music\\n\\nfor a dedicated period of time each day\\n\\nof about 10 to 30 minutes,\\n\\nsome studies looked at as much as 60 minutes,\\n\\nbut typically 10 to 30 minutes,\\n\\nwhat one finds is that heart rate variability increases,\\n\\nnot just during the period\\n\\nwhen they're listening to the music,\\n\\nthis is very important,\\n\\nbut also heart rate variability is increased\\n\\naround the clock in those subjects, even during sleep.\\n\\nMaking listening to 10 to 30 minutes\\n\\nof your favorite music each day,\\n\\nnot just what I would think to be a enjoyable protocol,\\n\\nif you could even call it a protocol,\\n\\nit's so enjoyable to listen to your favorite music\\n\\nthat it feels almost inappropriate to call it a protocol\\n\\nbecause protocol sounds kind of rigid\\n\\nlike you're imposing that on yourself.\\n\\nBut if you need an excuse to listen to your favorite music\\n\\nfor 10 to 30, maybe 60 minutes per day\\n\\nand just attending to that music,\\n\\nnot while doing anything else,\\n\\nwhich is what these studies had subjects do,\\n\\nwell, indeed that's been shown\\n\\nto increase heart rate variability around the clock,\\n\\nwhich we know is beneficial\\n\\nfor your mental and physical health more generally.\\n\\nOkay, so there are dozens, if not hundreds of studies\\n\\nthat have explored how music impacts our physiology.\\n\\nAnd as I just mentioned,\\n\\nit seems that if we listen to music that we like\\n\\nfor 10 to 30, maybe 60 minutes a day,\\n\\nour physiology, certain health metrics,\\n\\nheart rate variability in particular improve.\\n\\nNow, in light of the positive effects\\n\\nof listening to music on one's health,\\n\\nthere's a recent meta-analysis\\n\\nthat I found particularly interesting.\\n\\nThe title of this meta-analysis\\n\\nis effects of music on the cardiovascular system.\\n\\nAnd it was published in Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine.\\n\\nNow from the title of this paper,\\n\\neffects of music on the cardiovascular system,\\n\\nyou might think that it's just yet another meta-analysis\\n\\nexploring how music impacts heart rate variability\\n\\nand things of that sort.\\n\\nBut what's interesting about this study\\n\\nis that it identifies that the way in which\\n\\nlistening to one's favorite music\\n\\npositively impacts the cardiovascular system\\n\\nand other aspects of our physiology\\n\\nis very likely not through direct changes on our heart rate\\n\\nsimply by listening to music,\\n\\nbut rather through changes in our breathing.\\n\\nAnd this is true even if people were not singing along\\n\\nwith the music, by the way.\\n\\nNow, the relationship between breathing and heart rate\\n\\nis something that I've touched on before,\\n\\nbut if you haven't heard me discuss this,\\n\\nI'm just going to briefly tell you the relationship\\n\\nin two or three sentences,\\n\\nand then I'll explain the mechanism\\n\\nalso in about two to three sentences.\\n\\nSo if you have a background in biology or even if you don't,\\n\\nthis will all be very simple and very clear.\\n\\nWhen you deliberately inhale with a lot of vigor\\n\\nor you deliberately make your inhale longer\\n\\nthan you naturally would.\\n\\nSo for instance, if I breathe in very vigorously\\n\\nthrough my nose,\\n\\nsomething very specific happens to your heart rate.\\n\\nIt increases.\\n\\nWhereas when you deliberately exhale,\\n\\nmeaning when you exhale and deliberately\\n\\nmake that exhale longer,\\n\\nor you deliberately add vigor to that exhale,\\n\\nor even a shorter, deliberate, more vigorous exhale,\\n\\nyou slow down your heart rate.\\n\\nAnd that's because of a phenomenon\\n\\ncalled respiratory sinus arrhythmia,\\n\\nwhich because it includes the word arrhythmia,\\n\\nsounds like a bad thing,\\n\\nbut it's actually a wonderful thing.\\n\\nIt has to do with the relationship\\n\\nbetween a particular muscle in your body called the diaphragm,\\n\\nwhich when you inhale, our lungs fill with air,\\n\\nour diaphragm moves down,\\n\\nand our heart therefore has a little bit more space.\\n\\nIt actually gets bigger, temporarily bigger, but bigger.\\n\\nAnd when it does that,\\n\\nwhatever volume of blood is in the heart\\n\\nis now moving through a larger space.\\n\\nSo it's the same amount of blood\\n\\nmoving through a larger space.\\n\\nAnd the nervous system registers that\\n\\nas the blood moving more slowly\\n\\nthrough that temporarily enlarged heart.\\n\\nAnd as a consequence, there's a signal sent\\n\\nthrough various stations of the nervous system\\n\\nto the heart to speed the heart up.\\n\\nIn other words, just as I said before,\\n\\nwhen we inhale, our heart rate speeds up.\\n\\nConversely, when we exhale, our lungs empty out some air,\\n\\nour diaphragm moves up.\\n\\nAnd as a consequence of that,\\n\\nthere's less space for the heart.\\n\\nAnd so our heart temporarily becomes smaller.\\n\\nAnd when that happens,\\n\\nthe volume of blood within that smaller heart\\n\\nmoves more quickly.\\n\\nAnd that's detected by the nervous system,\\n\\nwhich then triggers a neural signal\\n\\nfrom the parasympathetic arm\\n\\nof the autonomic nervous system,\\n\\nwhich is just fancy nerd speak for a neural signal\\n\\nis sent to your heart every time you exhale\\n\\nto slow your heart down.\\n\\nSo the well-established effects\\n\\nof listening to your favorite music,\\n\\nincreasing your heart rate variability\\n\\nis not a direct interaction\\n\\nbetween the sounds coming in through your ears\\n\\nand changes in your heart rate\\n\\nwhile you're listening to the music.\\n\\nThat's actually what I would have thought happened,\\n\\nbut this more recent meta-analysis pulls apart the variables\\n\\nin these different studies.\\n\\nIt really illustrates that when we are listening to music,\\n\\nwe are subconsciously, most of the time subconsciously,\\n\\nchanging our patterns of breathing.\\n\\nWe are inhaling in anticipation\\n\\nof certain things happening in the music.\\n\\nWe're exhaling when we feel a relief of tension.\\n\\nWe get excited.\\n\\nWe may get sad.\\n\\nWe may get happy.\\n\\nWe may even just be listening to music\\n\\nthat we don't think is impacting our physiology\\n\\nat such a core level, but indeed it is.\\n\\nMusic is able to route into our nervous system\\n\\nat levels below our conscious awareness\\n\\nand literally turn the various knobs, if you will,\\n\\nof our cardiovascular system, of our breathing apparatus,\\n\\nthe diaphragm, the lungs.\\n\\nIt can evoke respiratory sinus arrhythmia,\\n\\nwhich again, sounds like a terrible thing,\\n\\nbut is actually the reflection\\n\\nof a healthy nervous system in heart.\\n\\nAnd in doing so, yes, it increases heart rate variability,\\n\\nsomething that is beneficial to all of us,\\n\\nbut it's doing so by changing our patterns of breathing.\\n\\nSo if you've ever wondered why music can change\\n\\nhow you feel so robustly,\\n\\nwell, it's doing that at a deep foundational level\\n\\nof your nervous system.\\n\\nIndeed, at the levels of your nervous system\\n\\nthat typically are not in your conscious awareness,\\n\\nbecause I have to imagine that most of you\\n\\nare probably not listening to music and thinking,\\n\\noh, here comes that one chorus\\n\\nor here comes that one melody\\n\\nand this is where I always exhale\\n\\nor this is where I always hold my breath,\\n\\nthis sort of thing.\\n\\nNo, most people are just listening to music.\\n\\nIt's coming in through their ears.\\n\\nThey're experiencing some bodily sensations.\\n\\nMaybe they're moving their torso, arms,\\n\\nmaybe arms and torso.\\n\\nMaybe you're not moving at all, no dancing.\\n\\nMaybe just listening within your head\\n\\nor maybe it's just dropped into the background\\n\\nbelow your conscious awareness at all.\\n\\nAnd yet that music is communicating emotion.\\n\\nIt's evoking emotion.\\n\\nIt's communicating intent.\\n\\nIt's activating those pre-motor circuits\\n\\nthat would have you move if it could.\\n\\nAnd we'll talk about dance a little bit later.\\n\\nBut even if you're not dancing,\\n\\neven if you're not swaying the tiniest bit,\\n\\nyour patterns of breathing are changing\\n\\nand through respiratory sinus arrhythmia,\\n\\nyour heart rate is changing\\n\\nand through changes in your heart rate,\\n\\nyour heart rate variability is increasing.\\n\\nSo if ever you wanted a tool or protocol\\n\\nthat was easy to use,\\n\\nbut could positively impact your mental and physical health,\\n\\nwell, listening to your favorite music for 10 to 30,\\n\\nmaybe 60 minutes, maybe more per day is that protocol.\\n\\nAs many of you know,\\n\\nI've been taking AG1 daily since 2012.\\n\\nSo I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.\\n\\nAG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\\n\\nthat's designed to meet\\n\\nall of your foundational nutrition needs.\\n\\nNow, of course, I try to get enough servings\\n\\nof vitamins and minerals through whole food sources\\n\\nthat include vegetables and fruits every day,\\n\\nbut oftentimes I simply can't get enough servings.\\n\\nBut with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals\\n\\nand the probiotics that I need\\n\\nand it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress.\\n\\nSimply put, I always feel better when I take AG1.\\n\\nI have more focus and energy and I sleep better\\n\\nand it also happens to taste great.\\n\\nFor all these reasons, whenever I'm asked,\\n\\nif you could take just one supplement, what would it be?\\n\\nI answer AG1.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try AG1,\\n\\ngo to drinkag1.com slash Huberman to claim a special offer.\\n\\nThey'll give you five free travel packs\\n\\nplus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.\\n\\nAgain, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nSo hopefully it's becoming clear\\n\\njust how absolutely powerful music is\\n\\nat evoking different physiological responses within you,\\n\\nthat is within your brain and body.\\n\\nBut there's an additional one\\n\\nthat I find particularly interesting\\n\\nbecause it addresses and indeed answers\\n\\none of the most common questions\\n\\nthat I receive all the time,\\n\\nwhich is how can I get more motivated?\\n\\nNot how I, Andrew can get more motivated,\\n\\nalthough of course I asked myself that question\\n\\nfrom time to time.\\n\\nAlthough admittedly, most of the time I'm wondering\\n\\nhow I'm just going to get everything that I need\\n\\nto get done, done.\\n\\nBut I often get the question,\\n\\nhow can I feel more motivated?\\n\\nOr what can I do to sustain my motivation over time?\\n\\nAnd we hear a lot of different strategies\\n\\nabout how to do that.\\n\\nWe hear about the quote unquote, just do it strategy,\\n\\nthe incredible slogan that Nike created\\n\\nand that persists to this day\\n\\nhas become commonplace in culture.\\n\\nAnd indeed the just do it form of advice\\n\\ncan be a good one, but for a lot of people,\\n\\njust hearing just do it or telling themselves just do it\\n\\nis not something that can evoke action in them.\\n\\nOther people will listen to motivational speeches,\\n\\nthey'll look at motivational videos,\\n\\nthey'll read motivational books,\\n\\nthey may even hire coaches.\\n\\nIn other words, people invest a ton of time, energy\\n\\nand money into trying to be more motivated.\\n\\nAnd indeed a number of episodes\\n\\nof the Huberman Lab podcast have focused on\\n\\nthe relationship between say motivation drive\\n\\nand the neuromodulator dopamine.\\n\\nWe have several episodes about that as well as a toolkit,\\n\\nall of which are available at zero cost\\n\\nat hubermanlab.com.\\n\\nYou can access those easily by putting motivation\\n\\ninto the search function at hubermanlab.com.\\n\\nAll of that will come up timestamped, et cetera.\\n\\nBut perhaps surprisingly today's conversation about music\\n\\noffers us a particularly potent tool to increase motivation.\\n\\nAnd that's because one of the fundamental properties\\n\\nof listening to music is that it evokes activation\\n\\nof these pre-motor and motor circuits\\n\\nwithin our brain and body.\\n\\nThat is the neural circuits whose specific job\\n\\nis to mobilize our body from its current position and state\\n\\nto a new position and state.\\n\\nSo for those of you that listen to music while you work out\\n\\nor prior to when you work out,\\n\\nyou are definitely onto something.\\n\\nFor those of you that don't, that's fine too.\\n\\nWhat I'm going to describe now are the specific sets\\n\\nof neural circuits that listening to music activates.\\n\\nAs I mentioned earlier, listening to music activates\\n\\nso many circuits throughout the brain and body\\n\\nthat really one can take a step back\\n\\nfrom the scientific literature on this and say,\\n\\nanytime someone has done a study\\n\\nwhere human beings listen to music\\n\\nand people record from a particular brain area,\\n\\nbelieve it or not, even from the olfactory system,\\n\\nfrom the system in the brain responsible for smell,\\n\\nthere seems to be some significant shift\\n\\nin terms of the neural firing there\\n\\nor the release of neural chemicals,\\n\\nwhich on the one hand might lead you to conclude\\n\\nthat listening to music is just sort of a non-specific\\n\\ngeneralized activator of nervous system function.\\n\\nIt's just kind of like turning all the lights on,\\n\\nbut that's not the case.\\n\\nMusic in fact is activating different neural circuits\\n\\ndifferently in time and space\\n\\nto evoke a whole set of specific reactions\\n\\nin your brain and body,\\n\\nbut not the least of which is the propensity for you to move.\\n\\nAnd this is something that you can leverage.\\n\\nAnd indeed I'll describe a protocol\\n\\nby which you can leverage music\\n\\nin order to greatly increase your state of motivation.\\n\\nOkay, so this is the portion of today's episode\\n\\nwhere we're going to discuss some specific neural circuits,\\n\\nbut I want to assure you that if you're a neurobiologist,\\n\\nyou can understand this.\\n\\nIf you are not a neurobiologist,\\n\\nin fact, if you took no biology ever in your life,\\n\\nI'm going to make it clear and easy for you to understand.\\n\\nAs I mentioned before, when we hear music,\\n\\nit activates many, many circuits throughout the brain\\n\\nand body.\\n\\nWhen I say circuits, I mean neurons,\\n\\nnerve cells that communicate with one another\\n\\nand sort of chains of reactions.\\n\\nWhen I say respond to one another,\\n\\nwhat I mean is when neurons are quote unquote activated,\\n\\nthey release chemicals.\\n\\nThose chemicals are called neurotransmitters,\\n\\nthings like glutamate, GABA.\\n\\nThey're also called neuromodulators,\\n\\nthings like dopamine, serotonin.\\n\\nThe names don't really matter for sake of today's discussion,\\n\\nbut what those things do is they influence the likelihood\\n\\nthat the next neuron will be active or less active.\\n\\nOkay, so neurons speak the language, if you will,\\n\\nof electricity, because that's how they evoke release\\n\\nof these chemicals and chemistry.\\n\\nThey vomit out these chemicals.\\n\\nThose chemicals then bind to little parking spots\\n\\non the next neuron called receptors,\\n\\nand then the next neuron gets activated electrically\\n\\nand then to the next neuron and next neuron and so on.\\n\\nIt's a chain of electrochemical reactions.\\n\\nOkay, so there's your neuroscience 101 lesson for today.\\n\\nWhen people listen to music,\\n\\nthere is heightened activation\\n\\nof the so-called frontal cortex,\\n\\nthe area of your brain which is on the surface\\n\\nbelow your skull, but just behind your forehead more or less.\\n\\nAnd that area of your brain is involved\\n\\nin a lot of different things.\\n\\nIt's involved in understanding context,\\n\\nwhat sorts of behaviors and thoughts and actions\\n\\nare appropriate for a given environment.\\n\\nBy the way, if any of you have ever been\\n\\nin an environment where everyone was really quiet\\n\\nand you thought, oh my gosh,\\n\\nwhat's keeping me from just blurting out my name right now\\n\\nor saying something totally inappropriate,\\n\\nyour frontal cortex is the one providing\\n\\nthe so-called top-down inhibition on that impulse\\n\\nto blurt something inappropriate out.\\n\\nAnd by the way, your thoughts about that impulse\\n\\nare perfectly normal.\\n\\nThey actually reflect a heightened sense of normalcy\\n\\nbecause it means that your brain is thinking\\n\\nabout how it's not going to do that.\\n\\nAnd so therefore you're not going to do that.\\n\\nLikewise, if you are ever at the edge of a high bridge,\\n\\nplease stay on the safe side of the railing.\\n\\nBut if you think, oh my goodness,\\n\\nwhat's keeping me from just jumping\\n\\noff the bridge right now,\\n\\nwhat's keeping you from doing that is your frontal cortex.\\n\\nIt's suppressing certain actions in a context dependent way\\n\\nin particular actions that are dangerous to you socially,\\n\\nphysically, dangerous to others,\\n\\nsocially, physically, et cetera.\\n\\nNow, the frontal cortex in order to do that\\n\\nalso has an incredible ability to make predictions.\\n\\nSo this is the function of the frontal cortex\\n\\nthat I want to focus on for the moment.\\n\\nYour frontal cortex is great at doing the,\\n\\nif this, then that type of analysis.\\n\\nIf I say this, everyone will be offended.\\n\\nOr if I say this, maybe they'll laugh.\\n\\nOr if I don't say this, I'll be safe.\\n\\nIf I do say that, I won't be safe, this kind of thing.\\n\\nFrontal cortex is activated when we listen to music\\n\\nbecause within music, there are some regularities.\\n\\nSometimes these are described as motifs\\n\\nor melodies or choruses.\\n\\nAgain, this is the entire landscape of discussion\\n\\nthat we could have and we will have with an expert guest\\n\\nabout how the mathematics of music\\n\\nimpacts the electrochemical signaling within the brain\\n\\nand the coding that is the mathematics of brain function,\\n\\nwhich leads us to predict that certain things\\n\\nbecause they just happened are likely to happen again\\n\\nor not happen again.\\n\\nBut let's set all that aside for the moment\\n\\nand just state the simple fact,\\n\\nwhich is that when you listen to music,\\n\\nyour frontal cortex increases in activation\\n\\nbecause it is predicting what you're going to hear next\\n\\nbased on what you're currently hearing\\n\\nand what you heard before.\\n\\nNow, I am from the generation\\n\\nthat we didn't have iPods when I was a kid.\\n\\nWe did have CDs, we did have tapes,\\n\\nbut you had to fast forward or rewind a cassette tape\\n\\nor you had to skip on the CD\\n\\nin order to move about the album in time.\\n\\nNowadays, you can queue up different songs\\n\\nin different order really easily.\\n\\nBut if you are somebody who listens to albums\\n\\nstart to finish, or if you're like me\\n\\nand you grew up listening to albums start to finish,\\n\\nmaybe occasionally skipping a song,\\n\\nbut you will be very familiar with this phenomenon,\\n\\nwhich is that right as a given song ends,\\n\\nif you're familiar with that album,\\n\\nyou already anticipate the start of the next song\\n\\nin your head.\\n\\nAnd that just speaks to the predictive function\\n\\nthat the frontal cortex plays.\\n\\nSo if you have a mixtape with a bunch of different songs,\\n\\nsure, you don't expect one song of a given artist\\n\\nto lead into the next.\\n\\nBut if you're somebody who's listened to that mixtape a lot,\\n\\nso you're familiar with what song comes next,\\n\\nor if you're listening to a given album,\\n\\nstart to finish and you're very familiar with it,\\n\\nwell, then you'll immediately resonate\\n\\nwith what I'm saying here,\\n\\nwhich is that your frontal cortex is always anticipating\\n\\nwhat sound is likely to come next.\\n\\nAnd this is very important\\n\\nbecause one of the key things about music\\n\\nand its ability to evoke our sense of surprise or delight\\n\\nthrough the release of a neuromodulator called dopamine,\\n\\nwe'll get to this a bit more later,\\n\\nis because that prediction machinery is thinking,\\n\\noh, I heard that set of chords a moment ago,\\n\\nI'm going to hear it again.\\n\\nAnd then when it changes up, your brain goes,\\n\\noh, whoa, hold on, that wasn't what I expected.\\n\\nAnd it sometimes does that with a sense of delight,\\n\\nlike, oh, yes.\\n\\nAnd sometimes it hears that and goes,\\n\\noh, wait, what's this?\\n\\nI don't really like this that much.\\n\\nI like the opener of that song,\\n\\nbut I don't really like the rest.\\n\\nI think of that as, you know, there's certain pastries,\\n\\nmuffins in particular, where I really like the top,\\n\\nit's got the little crumbs, it's got the berries and stuff,\\n\\nand then you can like get down past the top\\n\\nand then you get to the middle thing,\\n\\nyou're like, oh, well, this thing's not that good.\\n\\nOkay, there's certain songs like that for me.\\n\\nSo I always thought of those as muffin songs\\n\\nbecause the top of the muffin is always the best,\\n\\nwhereas a donut is great the whole way through.\\n\\nAnd now I'm going on a tangent\\n\\nbecause I'm thinking about muffins and donuts.\\n\\nSo I'm going to take us back to music.\\n\\nBut the point is relevant nonetheless,\\n\\nwhich is that your frontal cortex is making predictions.\\n\\nAnd when those predictions are broken,\\n\\nthat's a sense of novelty.\\n\\nAnd when that novelty is something that you like, okay,\\n\\nso it evokes a sense of, yes, I like that.\\n\\nWell, then dopamine is deployed.\\n\\nAnd when that novelty is something you don't like,\\n\\ntypically there's a reduction in the amount of dopamine\\n\\nreleased in a separate set of brain circuits\\n\\nbelow whatever level of dopamine happened to be there prior,\\n\\nyour so-called baseline level of dopamine, okay?\\n\\nSo when you listen to music,\\n\\nthere's a strong activation\\n\\nof the prediction machinery in your brain.\\n\\nThere's also activation of the circuits in your brain\\n\\nthat register novelty.\\n\\nWhat are those circuits?\\n\\nThese are things like the ventral tegmental area\\n\\nand the nucleus accumbens.\\n\\nI've talked about these before on the podcast.\\n\\nAgain, you don't need to know those names.\\n\\nThose are the names given to certain brain areas\\n\\nthat control the release of dopamine in time\\n\\naccording to whatever you happen to be experiencing\\n\\nin that moment, okay?\\n\\nSo the mesolimbic reward pathway\\n\\ncould perhaps better be called\\n\\nthe mesolimbic reinforcement pathway.\\n\\nSo for those of you out there shouting,\\n\\nwait, the mesolimbic pathway does a bunch of other things.\\n\\nIt's not just dopamine.\\n\\nI agree, it's also serotonin.\\n\\nIt's a bunch of other things.\\n\\nBut for today's discussion,\\n\\nwe're thinking about the mesolimbic pathway\\n\\nas deploying dopamine, which it does\\n\\nwhen we hear something novel,\\n\\nmeaning not what we predicted and we like what we hear.\\n\\nAnd then there are a bunch of other brain centers\\n\\nand circuits that listening to music activates.\\n\\nI'll just list off a few.\\n\\nSo again, this isn't intended to confuse anybody\\n\\nor add a lot of useless nomenclature.\\n\\nBut since I am a neuroscientist\\n\\nand this is a science and science informed tools podcast,\\n\\nI'd be remiss if I didn't mention\\n\\nthat we get strong activation of a brain structure.\\n\\nYou actually have two of them,\\n\\none on each side of the brain called the amygdala.\\n\\nThis is a brain area that's part of a larger set of circuits\\n\\nthat's associated with arousal, okay?\\n\\nMeaning becoming more alert,\\n\\nbecoming more aware of our surroundings\\n\\nand the particular sensory stimuli\\n\\nthat are coming in at a particular time,\\n\\nsuch as the notes of the music or a particular set of lyrics.\\n\\nAnd music also activates areas of the brain\\n\\nsuch as the parahippocampal formation,\\n\\nthe cortex and the hippocampus itself,\\n\\nbrain areas that encode and store memories.\\n\\nAnd this is something that I think\\n\\neveryone will be familiar with.\\n\\nWhen you hear certain songs or even songs\\n\\nthat sound like certain songs\\n\\nor even songs that you swear you've never heard before,\\n\\nit can evoke a sense of nostalgia,\\n\\nof longing for something, of missing somebody,\\n\\nof sadness or of delight and happiness\\n\\nand positive memories of somebody or something.\\n\\nIndeed, I think it's fair to say\\n\\nthat hearing particular pieces of music,\\n\\nparticular songs more than any other experience\\n\\ncan activate a whole library\\n\\nof memory and emotions within us.\\n\\nAnd that's because of its ability\\n\\nto activate the parahippocampal regions of the brain,\\n\\nthe cortex and the hippocampus itself.\\n\\nAgain, several different brain areas,\\n\\nall which communicate with one another\\n\\nand other areas of the brain\\n\\nin order to encode our memories,\\n\\nour sense of self, our sense of others,\\n\\nour sense of history with those people and on and on.\\n\\nNow, rather than just make this a catalog\\n\\nof different brain areas that music evokes,\\n\\nwhat I'm trying to do is spell out\\n\\nhow music activating these different brain areas\\n\\nis creating different components\\n\\nof what we are familiar with as our experience of music.\\n\\nSo frontal cortex prediction,\\n\\nmesolimbic reward pathway, novelty,\\n\\namygdala, a sense of emotion and arousal.\\n\\nParahippocampal cortex and cortex and hippocampus,\\n\\nour memories in particular, our emotional memories\\n\\nand our location memories associated\\n\\nwith a particular piece of music, right?\\n\\nHaven't you ever heard a song from,\\n\\nlet's say a summer camp that you went to when you were a kid\\n\\nand all of a sudden you're remembering the smell\\n\\nof the grasses at that summer camp.\\n\\nYou're remembering how some of the kids were really great\\n\\nand how some of the kids were really obnoxious.\\n\\nYou're remembering some things that you did.\\n\\nYou're remembering your counselors.\\n\\nI mean, there's just a whole landscape\\n\\nof neural information there,\\n\\nlife information stored in your head\\n\\nthat hearing a particular song that was sung\\n\\nwhen you were what, eight years old, 10 years old\\n\\nat camp just flips the lid on and it comes geysering out.\\n\\nRemarkable.\\n\\nNow there are two other sets of brain circuits\\n\\nthat are activated by music that deserve specific attention\\n\\nand deserve that specific attention now\\n\\nin the context of discussing motivation\\n\\nand music's ability to motivate us in particular ways.\\n\\nAnd those brain circuits are the basal ganglia, okay?\\n\\nSo this is a set of circuits within the brain\\n\\nthat are associated with action initiation,\\n\\nso-called go circuits and withholding action,\\n\\nso-called no-go circuits.\\n\\nBut basically the basal ganglia are involved\\n\\nin regulating movement and the cerebellum.\\n\\nThe cerebellum is sometimes referred to as the mini brain.\\n\\nIt looks like a little mini brain\\n\\nin the bottom back of the human brain.\\n\\nIn some species, the cerebellum is much larger\\n\\nrelative to the rest of the brain,\\n\\nbut in humans, it's like this little piece in the back\\n\\nthat looks like a little mini brain,\\n\\nlike you're carrying a second brain back there.\\n\\nThat's why I call it mini brain, cerebellum.\\n\\nAnd it's involved in a lot of things,\\n\\nbut one of its primary functions\\n\\nis to encode rhythmic timing and processing\\n\\nand along with its outputs to some deeper brainstem areas,\\n\\nthings like the vestibular and cochlear nuclei.\\n\\nWe'll talk about this, the parabracial nucleus.\\n\\nAgain, you don't need to know these names.\\n\\nIt, meaning the cerebellum along with the basal ganglia\\n\\ncreates patterns of activity in our brain\\n\\nthat cascade down to particular circuits in our body.\\n\\nSo these are so-called pre-motor circuits\\n\\nand motor circuits that generate the sense\\n\\nthat we not only can move, but that we want to move\\n\\nand that we want to move in particular ways.\\n\\nSo if you internalize nothing from the last five minutes\\n\\nor so in which I've been describing\\n\\nhow music impacts different neural circuits in the brain,\\n\\nplease do take away this important point,\\n\\nwhich is that when we listen to music,\\n\\nwe think of that as an auditory experience,\\n\\nbut now you know that it's also an emotional experience.\\n\\nAnd, and this is a very important and,\\n\\nwhen we listen to music,\\n\\nit is programming a specific set of motor actions\\n\\nthat are more likely to occur.\\n\\nPut differently, when we listen to music,\\n\\nwe are more likely to move our body and not just dance,\\n\\nnot just move our torso, our limbs,\\n\\nor our limbs and torso together in concert with the music,\\n\\nbut rather move our body from its current position\\n\\nto another position.\\n\\nAnd this is one of the most important things\\n\\nto understand about music.\\n\\nMusic, despite being an auditory stimulus\\n\\ncoming in through our ears,\\n\\nevokes the activation of neural circuits in our brain\\n\\nthat creates a sort of inertia.\\n\\nIt creates a propensity for action across our entire body.\\n\\nSo now that you understand that listening to music\\n\\nactivates lots of different brain circuits,\\n\\nof course, the circuits that respond to auditory stimuli,\\n\\nso called primary auditory cortex,\\n\\nis powerfully activated by listening to music,\\n\\nbut also circuits associated with novelty, anticipation.\\n\\nWe talked about circuits in the brain associated with memory,\\n\\nbut also circuits in the brain that are associated\\n\\nwith generating movement and not just movement\\n\\nthat is in sync with or corresponds to the music\\n\\nthat we're listening to, but all forms of movement.\\n\\nBut when we listen to music\\n\\nthat has a relatively fast cadence,\\n\\nand we can actually define what that cadence needs to be,\\n\\nand we'll do that in a moment.\\n\\nWhen we do that, so-called premotor circuitry,\\n\\nthe circuitry that's going to initiate that kind of inertia\\n\\nor that pressure for movement within the neural circuits\\n\\nthat actually evoke movement are all activated.\\n\\nSo for those of you that like to listen to music\\n\\nwhile you exercise, you're familiar with the fact\\n\\nthat listening to great songs with a great beat,\\n\\nwith particular lyrics, or that associate you\\n\\nwith a particular time or place in your life\\n\\ncan be very motivating.\\n\\nBut there are data showing that when people listen to music\\n\\nthat's faster than about 140 to 150 beats per minute,\\n\\nthat it creates a heightened state of motivation\\n\\nin the body to move.\\n\\nAnd the way that it does that is by way\\n\\nof shifting the balance between those go circuits\\n\\nand no-go circuits of the basal ganglia.\\n\\nThere's some other ways that it does it as well.\\n\\nFor instance, music can evoke the release\\n\\nof certain neurochemicals called the catecholamines.\\n\\nThese include dopamine, but also norepinephrine\\n\\nand epinephrine from centers in the brain\\n\\nand body glands in the body like the adrenal gland\\n\\nthat shift the body toward a predisposition\\n\\nof being more likely to move.\\n\\nSo if we want to distill all this out\\n\\nto a simple, actionable takeaway, simply know this.\\n\\nListening to music, relatively faster music,\\n\\npredisposes you to be more motivated to move.\\n\\nAnd that is independent.\\n\\nThis is what I find so cool.\\n\\nIt's independent of whether or not you're familiar\\n\\nwith the song, independent of whether or not the lyrics\\n\\nof the song are motivating lyrics.\\n\\nIf they are, that's just going to layer on top\\n\\nof the faster cadence,\\n\\nwhich is going to predispose you to move.\\n\\nBut what's remarkable is that just listening\\n\\nto that faster cadence music\\n\\nis creating a neuronal resonance, if you will,\\n\\na pattern of neuronal firing within you\\n\\nthat is going to essentially take your,\\n\\nand here I'm using metaphor,\\n\\nis going to put your state of motivation\\n\\nfrom either back on your heels to being flat-footed,\\n\\nor let's say you're mildly motivated,\\n\\nso I'll call that flat-footed,\\n\\nto being forward center of mass.\\n\\nSo for any of you that are suffering\\n\\nfrom lack of motivation, in particular to exercise,\\n\\nbut believe it or not, also to do cognitive work\\n\\nwhere you're going to be still and you're going to sit down\\n\\nand you're going to read or learn or practice something,\\n\\nlistening to music for 10 to 15 minutes prior\\n\\nto doing that work, prior to doing that exercise\\n\\nis one of the best ways to get motivated\\n\\nin order to engage in that work or engage in that exercise.\\n\\nThat's been demonstrated in the data very conclusively\\n\\nusing a variety of different types of music.\\n\\nAnd again, there are multiple mechanisms that converge\\n\\nto create that heightened state of motivation.\\n\\nSome of those mechanisms are neurochemical,\\n\\nlike the release of the so-called catecholamine,\\n\\ndopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.\\n\\nSome of them are strictly neural circuit-based,\\n\\nso activation of premotor circuitry,\\n\\nand those are going to combine with neural circuits\\n\\nthat are going to narrow your field of vision.\\n\\nThis is a good thing whenever you want to be motivated,\\n\\nthey're going to literally constrict your field of vision\\n\\nto more of a tunnel type of vision,\\n\\nas opposed to more panoramic vision,\\n\\nand that I described it as placing you\\n\\ninto a forward center of mass.\\n\\nI don't necessarily mean literally a forward center of mass,\\n\\nunless perhaps you're exercising like running,\\n\\nleaning slightly forward.\\n\\nWhat I'm talking about is using music as a way\\n\\nto deliberately shift your state of mind and body\\n\\nfrom one that is a-motivated,\\n\\nnot motivated to more motivated.\\n\\nAnd it's a very simple protocol\\n\\nextracted from the peer-reviewed literature.\\n\\nYou simply find some faster music,\\n\\nhopefully music that you like, it would be even better\\n\\nif it was music that had lyrics that you find motivating,\\n\\nand listening to that for 10 to 15 minutes\\n\\nprior to engaging in whatever that work may be,\\n\\nphysical or cognitive.\\n\\nOn the topic of cognitive work,\\n\\none of the most common questions I get is,\\n\\nwhat sorts of sounds or music should I listen to\\n\\nin order to increase my state of productivity,\\n\\nmotivation, concentration, et cetera?\\n\\nOn previous podcasts related to focus and motivation,\\n\\nI touched on the use of so-called binaural beats,\\n\\nwhich are different frequencies of beats\\n\\npresented to one or the other ear.\\n\\nThis is best accomplished with headphones,\\n\\nand there are a lot of different frequencies\\n\\nof binaural beats that you can get out there.\\n\\nIf you want to get detailed about this,\\n\\nbinaural beats also involve the differential\\n\\nbetween the frequency of beats between the two,\\n\\npresented to the two ears,\\n\\nand then that difference then is heard\\n\\nby higher order processing centers in the brain.\\n\\nIn any event, we don't have to get too technical about it.\\n\\nWe can simply say that, yes,\\n\\nthere are some decent peer-reviewed studies\\n\\ndemonstrating that when people listen to so-called 40 hertz,\\n\\nit's a particular frequency of sound,\\n\\n40 hertz binaural beats,\\n\\nthat it can enhance concentration and focus.\\n\\nHowever, this is important, there are some recent studies\\n\\nthat show that binaural beats sometimes\\n\\ncan impede concentration and focus,\\n\\nand thereby can impede cognitive performance\\n\\non various tasks.\\n\\nHowever, the studies that show that binaural beats\\n\\ncan be detrimental to performance on various cognitive tasks\\n\\ndid not use 40 hertz binaural beats specifically.\\n\\nSo we are still awaiting more studies on binaural beats.\\n\\nMeanwhile, I'll just restate what I said before,\\n\\nis that there is some evidence\\n\\nthat listening to 40 hertz binaural beats\\n\\ncan enhance concentration and focus.\\n\\nThere are also data showing that other frequencies\\n\\nof binaural beats might be detrimental to concentration\\n\\nand cognitive performance.\\n\\nAnd previously, I've also discussed studies showing\\n\\nthat for instance, if people listen to white noise\\n\\nin the background, you could do this on your computer\\n\\nor speakers in the room or headphones,\\n\\nor so-called brown noise,\\n\\nwhich is essentially like white noise,\\n\\nall frequencies of sound or most frequencies of sound\\n\\ncombined, but with particular frequencies of sounds\\n\\nthat are accentuated and others are notched out\\n\\nas it's called, so-called brown noise.\\n\\nRather than understand all of this at a technical level,\\n\\nbecause I've covered that before in previous podcasts,\\n\\nsuffice to say, if you go to YouTube\\n\\nand you just put in white noise background\\n\\nfor cognitive focus or brown noise background\\n\\nfor cognitive focus, you can just try those if you like\\n\\nduring a session in which you're trying to read or learn\\n\\nor do mathematics or music or any kind of cognitive work.\\n\\nIf you don't like them, if they don't work for you,\\n\\nthen there's certainly no obligation to use them.\\n\\nLikewise with 40 Hertz binaural beats.\\n\\nAnd for binaural beats, you can also find those\\n\\nas zero cost YouTube scripts.\\n\\nThere are a number of zero cost apps\\n\\nthat will allow you to listen to binaural beats.\\n\\nI've used the app Brainwave for some period of time now.\\n\\nTo be honest, I've never done this strict control experiment\\n\\non myself of listening to the 40 Hertz binaural beats\\n\\nor not listening to 40 Hertz binaural beats\\n\\ndoing the equivalent types of tasks.\\n\\nI can be fairly regimented with my work and behavior,\\n\\nbut I haven't run a detailed controlled study\\n\\non myself around this.\\n\\nRather, if I want to heighten my level of focus\\n\\nor rule out distractions, what I will do\\n\\nis I will listen to either white noise or brown noise\\n\\nwhile I do work, or I will listen to 40 Hertz binaural beats\\n\\nwhile I do certain types of work.\\n\\nOr sometimes, frankly, I just work in silence.\\n\\nOther times I will listen to classical music\\n\\nin the background.\\n\\nI'm a big fan of listening to classical piano.\\n\\nI particularly like Glenn Gould, the Bach variations.\\n\\nThose are very pleasant to me.\\n\\nBut, and this is really important,\\n\\nin researching this episode about music and the brain,\\n\\nwhat I discovered was in the controlled studies\\n\\nthat have been carried out as to whether or not\\n\\npeople perform better on cognitive tasks\\n\\nthat require a lot of focus, especially learning tasks,\\n\\nthat compared silence in the background\\n\\nto purely instrumental music in the background,\\n\\nto music with lyrics in the background,\\n\\nto one's favorite music with or without lyrics,\\n\\nthe data are very clear.\\n\\nIt's very clear that most people,\\n\\nthat means statistically, on average,\\n\\npeople perform best on cognitive tasks\\n\\nor tasks that require a lot of focus to perform.\\n\\nAgain, these are mental tasks, not physical tasks,\\n\\nwhen they are doing those tasks in complete silence.\\n\\nSo that was somewhat surprising to me.\\n\\nSecond best conditions are to do those tasks\\n\\nin the presence of instrumental music only.\\n\\nAnd in that case, there was a lot of variation\\n\\nas to whether or not people preferred faster cadence music.\\n\\nSo 140 to 150 beats per minute or faster,\\n\\nor slower music, 60 beats per minute or slower.\\n\\nI'll get back to those specific numbers later\\n\\nbecause they represent thresholds\\n\\nfor inducing different types of emotional states,\\n\\neither happy or sad.\\n\\nBut meanwhile, it's very clear when people work in silence,\\n\\nthey perform better than when they work\\n\\nwith music instrumentals in the background.\\n\\nAnd they perform even less well\\n\\nwhen they listen to music with lyrics in the background.\\n\\nWe'll talk about why that is the case in a moment.\\n\\nAnd then people perform especially poorly\\n\\nrelative to their performance in silence\\n\\nor any of the other conditions I mentioned\\n\\nwhen they listen to their favorite music\\n\\nwhile doing cognitive work.\\n\\nAnd that to me was a bit surprising,\\n\\nespecially since I spent a lot of my university years\\n\\nstudying while listening to my favorite music\\n\\nin different forms.\\n\\nI'd listen to slower music,\\n\\nthen faster music and go back and forth.\\n\\nAnd then sometimes turn it off altogether\\n\\nand work in silence.\\n\\nBut the center of mass of the literature\\n\\naround this issue of whether or not to listen to music\\n\\nwhile one studies or tries to learn something,\\n\\nthe data are pretty clear.\\n\\nThe data show that it's best to study\\n\\nand learn either in silence\\n\\nor with quiet instrumentals in the background.\\n\\nNow, I mentioned before that previous studies\\n\\ncompared the effects of working in silence\\n\\nversus working with 40 Hertz binaural beats\\n\\nor white noise or brown noise in the background.\\n\\nAnd in those studies,\\n\\nit was found that the white noise, brown noise\\n\\nand 40 Hertz binaural beats background\\n\\nproduced better levels of focus,\\n\\nI should say heightened levels of focus\\n\\nand cognitive performance and learning\\n\\nthan working in silence.\\n\\nBut I've not yet seen a study\\n\\nthat compared 40 Hertz binaural beats,\\n\\nbrown noise, white noise to music directly.\\n\\nPerhaps there's one out there.\\n\\nIf there is, please send it to me.\\n\\nI'd be very curious to learn what the results of those are.\\n\\nNow that might seem like a lot of information,\\n\\nbut the takeaways from it are very clear.\\n\\nAnd it's always nice when things are clear, right?\\n\\nIt's clear that if we want to focus and learn\\n\\nthat working in silence or with white noise or brown noise\\n\\nor 40 Hertz binaural beats is going to be preferable\\n\\nto working while listening to music.\\n\\nBut if you're going to listen to music while you work,\\n\\nthat is do cognitive work,\\n\\nthen you're going to want to listen to music\\n\\nthat is purely instrumental.\\n\\nAnd ideally the music would be somewhat faster\\n\\nthan 140 to 150 beats per minute.\\n\\nNow, I do not expect you to go and measure the frequency\\n\\nof beats per minute in the music that you listen to.\\n\\nAnd of course the beats per minute are going to change,\\n\\nright? That's an average 140 to 150 beats per minute.\\n\\nI don't expect you to get super technical,\\n\\nbreak down the music that you're listening to.\\n\\nThat is not my goal,\\n\\nnor is that really what this podcast is about.\\n\\nI think occasionally people think that, you know,\\n\\nthe goal of a science\\n\\nand science-based protocols podcast is\\n\\nto optimize everything.\\n\\nIn fact, I'm not such a fan of the word optimized\\n\\nbecause optimal really depends\\n\\non the situation that you happen to be in.\\n\\nThe point here is simply this,\\n\\nthat many people out there, including myself,\\n\\nhave been listening to some of our favorite music\\n\\nwhile working, but it's very clear\\n\\nas to why that degrades cognitive performance.\\n\\nWe know, for instance, that when we read,\\n\\nwe are creating a semantic narrative in our own head.\\n\\nAnd when we listen to music with lyrics,\\n\\nespecially music with lyrics that we recognize,\\n\\nthe semantic content of the song, the lyrics,\\n\\ncompetes with our comprehension of the narrative\\n\\nwithin our head from the material\\n\\nthat we're supposed to be learning.\\n\\nSo now it should be sort of obvious\\n\\nwhy listening to your favorite music that includes lyrics\\n\\nwhile trying to learn something else\\n\\nis going to impede learning.\\n\\nIt's because you've got multiple scripts,\\n\\nmultiple dialogues happening in your head.\\n\\nAnd in fact, this is an opportunity for me\\n\\nto take a slight tangent, but a relevant one,\\n\\nwhich is to say, a lot of times people will ask me\\n\\nhow I can retain a lot of information.\\n\\nI confess I never use a teleprompter for podcasting.\\n\\nI do have usually a short stack of notes,\\n\\nanywhere from one to six or seven pages\\n\\nof just bullet-pointed notes that cue up things\\n\\nthat I want to talk about\\n\\nand that I have researched in the literature.\\n\\nAnd then, of course, I'll refer to papers from time to time.\\n\\nBut one of the things that's been very useful for me,\\n\\nwhich was taught to me, by the way, by a professor\\n\\nwhen I was in university,\\n\\nto read and retain information that I've read by memory\\n\\nis that when I read, I'm trying to listen\\n\\nto the words being spoken in my head,\\n\\ntypically in my own voice,\\n\\nalthough sometimes in someone else's voice.\\n\\nIt doesn't really matter, I find.\\n\\nSo when I'm reading, yes, it's a process of visual scanning,\\n\\nbut I'm also listening to the words within my head\\n\\nas if they're being spoken.\\n\\nSome of you may be familiar with this because you do it.\\n\\nOthers of you, perhaps, might find this a bit more foreign.\\n\\nI'd be curious to know what your process of reading\\n\\nand retaining that information is,\\n\\nwhether or not it includes an internal dialogue.\\n\\nBut nonetheless, it should be very straightforward now\\n\\nto see why if you're listening to words\\n\\nthat you're reading on a page,\\n\\nmaybe even mumbling them a little bit,\\n\\nmoving your lips a little bit while you read,\\n\\nwhich, by the way, if you heard our episode\\n\\non language and auditory processing with Dr. Eddie Chang,\\n\\nwho's chair of neurosurgery at UCSF,\\n\\nhe talked about the fact that when we read any material,\\n\\nthat the brain is generating pre-motor activity,\\n\\nyou now know what pre-motor activity is,\\n\\npre-motor activity down to the muscles of the throat,\\n\\nlarynx and pharynx, which would speak those words\\n\\nwere those signals to get above a certain level,\\n\\nbut that when we read, typically,\\n\\nthe signals that are getting sent\\n\\nthrough those pre-motor circuits\\n\\nare just below the threshold\\n\\nof what would have us actually speak those words.\\n\\nPut simply, when we read,\\n\\nwe are just shy of saying what we are reading.\\n\\nAnd so when I say that when I read,\\n\\nI'm listening to the words in my head,\\n\\nthat's what I'm referring to.\\n\\nSo we're starting to funnel in on some general principles\\n\\nof music and how it impacts the brain\\n\\nand how that can be leveraged toward better learning\\n\\nand better motivation,\\n\\nboth in the context of physical and cognitive endeavors.\\n\\nOkay, so if you want to get motivated,\\n\\nlistening to music prior to doing something\\n\\nthat you're trying to motivate to do is a good idea.\\n\\nThat's what the data say.\\n\\nIf you're trying to learn something that's cognitive,\\n\\nthat requires reading, focus, and concentration,\\n\\nsilence, 40 Hertz, binaural beats,\\n\\nwhite noise or brown noise is probably best.\\n\\nAnd if you are going to listen to music,\\n\\nlistening to music that includes instrumentals,\\n\\nbut not lyrics would be best.\\n\\nAnd listening to music that includes lyrics\\n\\nthat you're very familiar with\\n\\nwould be the worst condition.\\n\\nNow, with that said, there are nice studies,\\n\\nand by the way, I'm going to link to a number of reviews\\n\\nand primary studies in the show note captions\\n\\nthat refer back to this point I'm about to tell you,\\n\\nwhich is that listening to music\\n\\nwhile trying to do cognitive tasks\\n\\ncan be detrimental toward learning that material.\\n\\nTurns out that if you listen to music\\n\\nin the breaks between trying to learn certain material,\\n\\nyou can actually heighten your level of cognition\\n\\nand focus and your ability to learn.\\n\\nSo I find this particularly cool.\\n\\nIt's not that music is bad\\n\\nfor focusing cognition and learning.\\n\\nIt's that listening to music,\\n\\nespecially music that you're familiar with\\n\\nthat includes lyrics at the same time\\n\\nas trying to learn something else is not a good idea.\\n\\nBut listening to music with lyrics,\\n\\nespecially music with lyrics that you're familiar with\\n\\nthat you find particularly uplifting and motivating\\n\\nis a cognitive and performance enhancer\\n\\nwhen you go back to doing that work in silence,\\n\\nor perhaps while listening to white noise,\\n\\nbrown noise, or 40 Hertz binaural beats.\\n\\nSo like so many things, the answer is not black and white.\\n\\nIt's not that silence is better than music\\n\\nor that music is bad for learning.\\n\\nIt turns out that listening to music,\\n\\neven music with lyrics you're very familiar with\\n\\ncan be highly beneficial for learning,\\n\\nbut that you want to listen to that music\\n\\nin the breaks between these bouts of cognitive work.\\n\\nNow, I've done previous podcasts that talk about\\n\\nhow long a bout of cognitive work can or should be.\\n\\nTypically 90 minutes is going to be the upper limit\\n\\nbefore you take a break.\\n\\nSome people can't work for 90 minutes without a break.\\n\\nAnd by the way, folks, when I say without a break,\\n\\nI don't mean remaining in a deep trench of focus\\n\\nfor 90 minutes.\\n\\nNobody does that.\\n\\nActually, I suppose there are a few folks\\n\\nthat with neurochemical assistance,\\n\\nor just by way of training can get themselves\\n\\ninto a deep, deep trench of focus for 90 minutes or more,\\n\\nbut most people are going to focus on something\\n\\nand then have their attention flit out of focus,\\n\\nand then they're going to have to draw their focus back\\n\\nto whatever it is they're doing.\\n\\nThat's not just typical, that's absolutely normal.\\n\\nAnd you shouldn't be concerned at all\\n\\nif you try and focus for three minutes\\n\\nand find your attention jumping around\\n\\ntwo or three times during that attempt.\\n\\nBut if you're somebody who is going to do,\\n\\nsay a 90 minute or even 60 minute\\n\\nor even 30 minute bout of work,\\n\\nand you are going to get up for a moment\\n\\nand use the restroom,\\n\\nor you're going to take a break in between bouts of work.\\n\\nSo maybe you work for 30 minutes,\\n\\ntake 10 minutes or five minutes off,\\n\\nor 90 minutes, take 30 minutes off,\\n\\nlistening to music in those breaks,\\n\\nit seems can increase our ability to focus\\n\\nand to learn new material\\n\\nonce we return to those bouts of cognitive focus.\\n\\nNow, when it comes to physical exertion,\\n\\ncardiovascular exercise, resistance training of any kind,\\n\\nmany people, including myself,\\n\\nlike to listen to music while performing\\n\\nthat physical exercise or that physical exertion.\\n\\nThe data on whether or not music\\n\\nimprove physical performance is a bit mixed.\\n\\nCertainly you can find studies\\n\\nthat show that it improves physical output.\\n\\nOther studies will say that it doesn't make a difference.\\n\\nOther studies will say that it reduces physical output.\\n\\nHowever, this is a very important,\\n\\nhowever, the type of physical exercise\\n\\nis not very well matched between those different studies.\\n\\nSo this is something that I believe\\n\\nis going to be highly individual.\\n\\nIn accordance with the published data, I mix it up.\\n\\nThere are times when I will head out for a run\\n\\nor I will do a resistance training session\\n\\nand I will listen to music,\\n\\nusually an album all the way through\\n\\nor a playlist all the way through,\\n\\nand that's because I don't want\\n\\nto be going onto my phone very often.\\n\\nIn fact, these days I use an older separate phone\\n\\nthat doesn't have any text messaging\\n\\nor communication to the outside world,\\n\\nbut it has music loaded into it or onto it.\\n\\nThat allows me to just listen to music\\n\\nso that I don't run the risk of getting distracted texting\\n\\nand doing things like that.\\n\\nI just want to focus on my physical exercise.\\n\\nI should say that phone also has audio books,\\n\\npodcasts, things I've downloaded to it.\\n\\nSo it's a place where I can listen to things\\n\\nbut not communicate with the outside world,\\n\\nat least while exercising.\\n\\nSome people do very well to listen to music,\\n\\nliterally in between and during their sets\\n\\nof resistance training throughout their entire runs.\\n\\nIt's going to be individual.\\n\\nYou have to figure out what's best for you.\\n\\nHowever, one of the most interesting things\\n\\nabout the scientific literature on this shows\\n\\nthat if people listen to music,\\n\\nin particular music that tends to be faster, more upbeat,\\n\\ntypically it's going to be in these studies,\\n\\nrock and roll music as opposed to classical.\\n\\nAlthough there are some studies that have explored classical\\n\\nand other forms of music as it relates to exercise,\\n\\nlistening to that music in between bouts of exertion.\\n\\nSo in the rest between sets of resistance training\\n\\nor periodically during say a run or about a cycling\\n\\ncan indeed enhance performance in a way that\\n\\nat least by my read of the data exceeds that\\n\\nwhich is observed when people just listen\\n\\nto music throughout.\\n\\nIn other words, if you find it useful to listen to music\\n\\nbefore, during and after your workouts, great, be my guest.\\n\\nHowever, what the data say is that switching up\\n\\nbetween silence and listening to music.\\n\\nAnd in this case, it would be listening to music\\n\\nthat you're very familiar with and that can evoke\\n\\na sense of motivation and desired action in you\\n\\nfor whatever reason, the music, the beat,\\n\\nthe memories that it draws you to, et cetera.\\n\\nWell, then that's going to be useful.\\n\\nSo there really isn't one protocol\\n\\nfor how to get the most out of music\\n\\nfor sake of physical exertion.\\n\\nBut if you're interested in playing\\n\\nwith some of these variables as they've been examined\\n\\nwithin the peer reviewed literature, I find it interesting.\\n\\nAnd indeed I found it useful to, for instance,\\n\\ndo a workout where I only listen to music\\n\\nin between sets of resistance training\\n\\nor to listen to music prior to going out for a run.\\n\\nAnd then oftentimes when I do that, the song will\\n\\nor songs will be sort of on loop in my head.\\n\\nAlthough I confess that a lot of times nowadays\\n\\nI listen to podcasts while I run or while I hike.\\n\\nAnd when I'm in the gym and I'm doing resistance training\\n\\nI like to listen to music as opposed to content\\n\\nthat requires that I really focus very heavily\\n\\non that content, such as a podcast, such as a book.\\n\\nI'd like to take a quick break\\n\\nand acknowledge our sponsor InsideTracker.\\n\\nInsideTracker is a personalized nutrition

music\\n\\nto shift our mood and indeed\\n\\nto get us out of states of anxiety.\\n\\nThis is a really interesting scientific literature\\n\\nwith some very specific actionable takeaways\\n\\nthat I think everyone will find beneficial.\\n\\nI certainly did.\\n\\nHowever, I want to point out\\n\\nthat we don't need a scientific study\\n\\nto illustrate for us the way that music can shift our mood.\\n\\nAnd you already know why it is\\n\\nthat listening to a sad song can sometimes make us feel sad\\n\\nlistening to happy music can make us feel happy.\\n\\nIt's because when we listen to music\\n\\nthere are some fundamental components of that music\\n\\nliterally the mathematical structure of that music\\n\\nincluding the frequency of sounds\\n\\nthe cadence of those sounds as well as the lyrics\\n\\nbut even in the absence of lyrics\\n\\nthat are activating brain circuits within us\\n\\nsuch that the frequencies of sound that we're hearing\\n\\nare evoking firing of neurons in the brain\\n\\nof the same frequency.\\n\\nIn other words, your brain becomes a bit of a piano\\n\\nplaying the same song that you're hearing inside your head.\\n\\nNow that's sort of a duh, right?\\n\\nYou hear music in your head\\n\\neven if you're listening to it from outside in the room.\\n\\nBut when you understand that neurons speak the language\\n\\nof electrochemical communication\\n\\nwhat we're talking about here is particular music\\n\\nevoking the release of neurochemicals in your brain\\n\\nat a particular frequency.\\n\\nSo just think about that for a second.\\n\\nWe know that neurochemicals such as dopamine, serotonin\\n\\nsome of the so-called endogenous opioids, right?\\n\\nThese aren't opioids that people take.\\n\\nThis isn't related to the opioid crisis.\\n\\nWe're talking about endogenous opioids\\n\\nthat are released in response to music\\n\\nthings like exercise\\n\\ndifferent types of social interactions.\\n\\nThose and other chemicals are released\\n\\naccording to the firing of specific neurons.\\n\\nAnd we know that when you listen to music\\n\\nat particular frequencies\\n\\narranged in particular motifs, et cetera\\n\\nthat the neurons that release those neurochemicals\\n\\nare firing at those same frequencies.\\n\\nIn other words, that the sound is causing\\n\\na sound dependent pharmacologic concert within your brain.\\n\\nSo that fact should make it incredibly clear\\n\\nas to why certain music, even in the absence of lyrics\\n\\ncan evoke certain emotional states.\\n\\nCertain sound frequencies are transformed\\n\\ninto the neural language within your brain\\n\\nthat releases certain neurochemicals\\n\\nthat create certain emotional states of brain and body.\\n\\nJust to drill in how incredible that really is\\n\\na little bit further, if you see a beautiful painting\\n\\nor the picture or presence of somebody's face in real life\\n\\nthat evokes a particularly strong positive\\n\\nor negative emotion, you can imagine that of course\\n\\nit creates the release of certain neurochemicals\\n\\nor perhaps in the case of a negative face\\n\\nsuppresses the release of certain neurochemicals.\\n\\nBut we can't say that a particular frequency of color\\n\\nsay reds against oranges or the presence of a rainbow\\n\\nevokes a sort of rainbow like cascade of neurochemicals\\n\\nwhereas with sound, that's exactly what's happening.\\n\\nAnd this isn't to diminish the value of vision\\n\\nin terms of its ability to evoke emotional states within us.\\n\\nAfter all, I'm foremost a neuroscientist\\n\\nbut under the umbrella of neuroscientists,\\n\\nI started off as and I continue to be a vision neuroscientist\\n\\nstudying the visual system and its ability\\n\\nto evoke emotional states within us.\\n\\nBut I have to acknowledge that the auditory system\\n\\nand in particular the circuits in the brain\\n\\nthat respond to music have a remarkably potent ability\\n\\nto evoke these emotional states.\\n\\nWhich is why when surveys have been done asking people\\n\\nwhy they listen to music, the responses that have come back\\n\\ngenerally resemble the following statistics.\\n\\nApproximately 90% of people say they listen to music\\n\\nto relax, approximately 82% of people self-report\\n\\nthat they listen to music in order to make themselves happy.\\n\\nApproximately 46.5% of people say that they listen to music\\n\\nin order to process particular states of emotion.\\n\\nWe'll get back to what process means in a moment.\\n\\nBut more often than not,\\n\\nwhen these studies have asked specific questions\\n\\nabout what particular types of emotions people\\n\\nare listening to in order to process their emotions better,\\n\\nit is the emotion of sadness.\\n\\nAnd 32.5% of people report that they listen to music\\n\\nin order to increase their sense of concentration.\\n\\nAnd we already talked about the role of music\\n\\nin concentration or its ability in some cases\\n\\nto inhibit concentration a few minutes ago.\\n\\nNow, you might be asking yourself,\\n\\nhow can 90% of people listen to music for one thing\\n\\nand 82% of people for another thing and so on and so forth\\n\\nwere well over 100% of people?\\n\\nWell, in this survey and other surveys like it,\\n\\npeople had the option to give multiple reasons\\n\\nfor listening to music because of course,\\n\\nmost people have multiple reasons for listening to music.\\n\\nNow, with that said, if we are to examine\\n\\nthis one particular category,\\n\\nnearly half of people who report listening to music\\n\\non a regular basis listen to music\\n\\nin order to process their emotions.\\n\\nWe can ask, what does the scientific literature\\n\\ntell us about how certain types of music\\n\\nevoke certain types of emotions\\n\\nor help us process certain emotions?\\n\\nAgain, we'll get back to what we mean\\n\\nby process in a moment.\\n\\nBut a number of studies have been done on this.\\n\\nThere's some meta-analyses that converge\\n\\non some general themes,\\n\\nwhat I refer to as the center of mass of data, right?\\n\\nWhen there are a lot of studies in a given area,\\n\\nthe outcomes of some of those studies\\n\\nconflict with one another.\\n\\nGenerally in a good meta-analysis,\\n\\nwhat happens is different studies\\n\\nare considered more powerful or less powerful than others\\n\\ndepending on how many subjects were involved,\\n\\nthe different control conditions\\n\\nor lack of control conditions and so on and so forth.\\n\\nThis is one of the great values of meta-analyses\\n\\nis that they don't treat all studies equally.\\n\\nThey separate out studies\\n\\nbased on their level of rigor and thoroughness.\\n\\nWell, what we can say with confidence\\n\\nis that music that makes us, quote unquote, happy\\n\\nor tends to shift people's state\\n\\nfrom less happy to happier,\\n\\nregardless of how they entered the experiment,\\n\\ntends to be faster music,\\n\\nmeaning music that on average contains\\n\\n140 to 150 beats per minute or faster, okay?\\n\\nAnd there's some other features to,\\n\\nquote unquote, happy music, if you will,\\n\\nthat it tends to be in a major key,\\n\\nthat if there are lyrics to that music,\\n\\nthat the lyrics tend to report things that are happy\\n\\nor, get this, total nonsense.\\n\\nIn fact, when the type of lyrics in this,\\n\\nquote unquote, happy music's, I guess,\\n\\nsinging about great events in life and positive things,\\n\\nfalling in love, being in love, positive memories,\\n\\nbirth of children, connection to friends, great adventures,\\n\\nthose lyrics, or I should say that music\\n\\ncontaining those lyrics was no more effective\\n\\nin creating states of happiness\\n\\nthan was music of equivalent cadence.\\n\\nSo again, music that was 140 to 150 beats per minute\\n\\nor faster on average.\\n\\nWell, even if the lyrics were complete nonsense,\\n\\neven if the vocalizations weren't actual words,\\n\\nit still evoked the same increase\\n\\nin the level of happiness in the subjects\\n\\nthan when compared to the music containing\\n\\ncoherent lyrics around happy events.\\n\\nWhat this means is that the cadence of music\\n\\nis no doubt the critical variable\\n\\nwhen one is trying to shift one's mood\\n\\nfrom a state of whatever, could be depressed or sad,\\n\\nto non-depressed, non-sad, or neutral to positive,\\n\\nand so on and so forth.\\n\\nBut what this also explains is one-hit wonders.\\n\\nRarely, if ever, by the way,\\n\\nare one-hit wonders sad and depressing songs?\\n\\nSometimes, almost always.\\n\\nThese one-hit wonders are songs that are very effective\\n\\nin shifting people's mood from not so happy to happier,\\n\\nor we could just say happier,\\n\\nregardless of where they started out\\n\\nbefore listening to the song, they feel better\\n\\nwhile and after listening to the song.\\n\\nAnd indeed, more often than not,\\n\\nthe lyrical content of those songs\\n\\nis not particularly meaningful.\\n\\nIt's not addressing a particularly meaningful state or issue.\\n\\nIt's just what some people call a party song,\\n\\nor it's something that's just uplifting,\\n\\nnot just to them, but to many other people,\\n\\nwhich actually brings up an interesting\\n\\nand future-looking point, which is that nowadays,\\n\\nwe are seeing the emergence of AI,\\n\\nartificial intelligence, being used to generate new songs\\n\\nby capturing these well-established rules\\n\\ngleaned from neuroscience of how music impacts the brain,\\n\\nsuch that in the future,\\n\\nartificial intelligence is going to be generating hit songs\\n\\nfor us, as opposed to having people generating hit songs.\\n\\nI know this evokes a state of concern and fear\\n\\nin many people.\\n\\nI think that this is a fear that needs to be matched\\n\\nwith, I don't know, perhaps a cautious optimism.\\n\\nI mean, who knows?\\n\\nMaybe there are patterns of music,\\n\\nincluding lyrics, that human beings\\n\\nin their current understanding of themselves\\n\\nand of music have not yet been able to tap into.\\n\\nAnd who knows, maybe AI will be generating\\n\\nthe best music that we've ever heard,\\n\\nor perhaps music that can shift our states\\n\\nfrom more depressed or sad to heightened levels of happiness\\n\\nin ways that humans have just not been able to accomplish.\\n\\nSo I think it's important to balance any pessimism about AI\\n\\nand its ability to generate music based on these rules\\n\\nof how music impacts the brain with an open-mindedness.\\n\\nAfter all, neuroscience, neuroimaging,\\n\\nand neural recordings directly with electrodes in the brain,\\n\\nwhile people are listening to music,\\n\\nis teaching us how the brain responds to that music\\n\\nand is giving us information that indeed human beings,\\n\\nbut also computers, can use in order to generate stimuli,\\n\\nmusic that can shift our brain into more positive states.\\n\\nAnd if that's the case, wouldn't that be wonderful?\\n\\nAnother established feature of happy music is, get this,\\n\\nits ability to get people to relax the furrow of their brow,\\n\\nindeed to raise their eyebrows and to be a bit wide-eyed,\\n\\nand not just through autonomic arousal,\\n\\nbut rather through activation of the muscles in the face.\\n\\nConversely, we know that sad music,\\n\\nand here we can define sad music.\\n\\nThis has actually been done in the literature.\\n\\nSad music tends to be slower than average,\\n\\nslower than 60 beats per minute or so, again, on average.\\n\\nAnd this again is independent of the lyrics\\n\\nthat might not even be present in the song.\\n\\nSad music tends to activate the corrugator muscles\\n\\nof the forehead, which are the muscles that furrow the brow\\n\\nand that lead to a kind of serious look.\\n\\nIt's a folding in of the face,\\n\\nas opposed to a widening up of the eyes\\n\\nand a relaxation of the brow.\\n\\nNow, given where we are in the course of this discussion,\\n\\nthat shouldn't be surprising.\\n\\nWe already talked about how listening to particular sounds\\n\\nevokes the release of particular neurochemicals,\\n\\nbut in a more direct fashion,\\n\\nlistening to particular sounds activates certain pre-motor\\n\\nand motor circuits within the brain and body,\\n\\nnot just the desire to move one's torso, limbs, or both,\\n\\nbob one's head or move a head side to side,\\n\\nbut also the micro structures of the face,\\n\\nwhich, because one of the main roles of the face\\n\\nis to communicate emotion,\\n\\nis going to cause either a relaxation of the brow\\n\\nand a lifting of the eyebrows or a furrowing\\n\\nor a activation of the corrugator muscles of the eyebrow.\\n\\nAnd if that's not obvious and yet interesting enough,\\n\\nwell, get this, there seems to be a direct relationship.\\n\\nI'm chuckling because this still just blows my mind\\n\\nbecause it's a total duh, obvious when you hear it,\\n\\nbut it's still just so cool\\n\\nthat there's a direct relationship of the frequency\\n\\nof the sound that you hear,\\n\\neither low-pitched or high-pitched,\\n\\nand the cadence of that sound,\\n\\nand here I realize I'm not using\\n\\ntechnical music theory language,\\n\\nbut whether or not that particular tone is played\\n\\nover and over, close in time or more spaced out in time,\\n\\nand facial expressions.\\n\\nAnd indeed, when we listen to bass tones,\\n\\nlow-frequency tones set apart from one another\\n\\nwith some distance so that they're not overlapping,\\n\\nwe get the all too familiar bass face.\\n\\nSo what I'm referring to here\\n\\nis what neuroscientists would call a labeled line,\\n\\nliterally a circuit of neurons that goes from the periphery,\\n\\nin this case, our ears,\\n\\ninto our brain through several different stations\\n\\nand then wicks out to impact all sorts of things\\n\\nwithin us, states of emotion, states of motivation,\\n\\nour propensity to move,\\n\\nbut also a labeled line circuit\\n\\ncoming from hearing low-frequency sounds\\n\\nplayed spaced apart from one another\\n\\nthat evokes a particular facial expression.\\n\\nAnd again, this takes us back to the earlier statement\\n\\nthat I made, which is not an original statement, frankly.\\n\\nThere are people within the field of auditory processing\\n\\nand understanding how the brain processes music.\\n\\nIn fact, one of the world experts in this,\\n\\nDr. Eric Jarvis at the Rockefeller University\\n\\nwas a guest on this podcast\\n\\nwhere we talked about the relationship\\n\\nbetween music, movement, and singing,\\n\\nand the fact that music, movement, in particular dance\\n\\nand singing likely preceded the evolution\\n\\nof modern spoken language.\\n\\nWell, Eric Jarvis and others have argued quite convincingly\\n\\nthat these circuits that I'm calling labeled lines\\n\\nto particular facial expressions and states of emotion\\n\\nare the most fundamental components\\n\\nof communication and the ways that humans have communicated\\n\\nabout their emotional state\\n\\nand literally induced that same emotional state\\n\\nin other members of our species\\n\\ndating back tens of thousands, if not more years.\\n\\nOne of the fun things about researching this episode\\n\\non music and the brain\\n\\nis that there are a lot of quality studies\\n\\nexploring how music impacts the brain, neuroimaging,\\n\\nneural recording data from excellent laboratories,\\n\\nas well as a lot of studies.\\n\\nIn fact, a surprising number of studies\\n\\nexploring how particular types of music\\n\\nimpacts mood states.\\n\\nAnd fortunately, that allowed me to glean\\n\\nsome very specific recommendations\\n\\nas to the minimum amounts of say happy music\\n\\nthat you need to listen to\\n\\nin order to shift your mood into a happier state.\\n\\nAnd indeed the numbers exist in the literature\\n\\nand it has been shown that the threshold\\n\\nfor significantly shifting one's mood into a happier state\\n\\nby listening to the sorts of music we talked about before,\\n\\nthat faster cadence music, even with nonsense lyrics,\\n\\nalthough it could include other lyrics,\\n\\ninstead is nine minutes, not 10, not eight, but nine.\\n\\nAnd I'm sort of joking when I say not 10, not eight, but nine\\n\\nbecause of course you could listen to music\\n\\nfor 10 minutes or 15 minutes or longer.\\n\\nIn fact, earlier we talked about the benefits of doing that.\\n\\nBut when one examines the various studies\\n\\nthat looked at how long subjects need to listen to music\\n\\nin order to shift their mood into a happier state,\\n\\nthe threshold seems to be nine minutes.\\n\\nSo if you want to feel happier than you currently feel,\\n\\nit seems that listening to happy music\\n\\nfor nine minutes or more\\n\\nis going to be the effective approach.\\n\\nOkay, so nine minutes or more\\n\\nto shift one state to happier.\\n\\nWhat about to process somber or sad feelings,\\n\\nfeelings of loss?\\n\\nWell, this raises an even bigger question\\n\\nand it's a question that I also get very often.\\n\\nAs you're noticing, I get a lot of questions often.\\n\\nIn any event, one of the common questions that I get\\n\\nis when we are feeling sad or experiencing a loss,\\n\\ngrieving the loss of a relationship by death or decision\\n\\nor by somebody moving away or the loss of a pet, et cetera,\\n\\nis it better to go into that state?\\n\\nIn other words, to quote unquote, feel one's feelings\\n\\nor to counter those feelings.\\n\\nNow, historically that's been a very difficult question\\n\\nfor me to answer because who am I to say\\n\\nwhether or not you should feel your feelings\\n\\nor whether or not feeling those feelings\\n\\nwill take you down a trench of feeling much worse\\n\\nor much better.\\n\\nIn fact, there's an emerging literature\\n\\nexactly about that issue.\\n\\nThat is whether or not the catharsis model\\n\\nis really best catharsis being the expression\\n\\nand feeling of one's emotions as a way to extrude\\n\\nor get rid of those emotions\\n\\nor whether or not that simply drives us further\\n\\ndown the trench of those emotions.\\n\\nThat's really something that we should address\\n\\nin a separate podcast episode.\\n\\nAnd I will have experts from the fields of psychiatry\\n\\nand psychology to help us address that question directly.\\n\\nBut since we're talking about music in the brain\\n\\nand the fact that music has a tremendous capacity\\n\\nto evoke emotional states, including sad states,\\n\\nwhat has been shown in the peer-reviewed literature\\n\\nis that when people who are feeling sad,\\n\\nfor whatever reason, loss of relationship, death,\\n\\nwho knows, doesn't really matter\\n\\nwhy they're feeling sad after all,\\n\\nit's that they're feeling sad,\\n\\nlistening to 13 minutes or more of sad music,\\n\\nthat music can contain lyrics they are familiar with\\n\\nor no lyrics, regardless of whether or not\\n\\nit contains lyrics, it's going to be on average\\n\\n50 or 60 beats per minute or less,\\n\\nwe established that already.\\n\\nListening to that for 13 minutes or more\\n\\nhas been shown to be effective in allowing people\\n\\nto quote unquote process their somber feelings\\n\\nand to some extent to move past their feelings of sadness.\\n\\nSo those studies support the idea\\n\\nthat when feeling sad, feeling one's feelings\\n\\nand perhaps even amplifying those feelings of sadness\\n\\nby listening to sad music for 13 minutes or more\\n\\ncan help people process those sad feelings.\\n\\nAnd while that point might seem overly reductionist,\\n\\nI actually think it's a real value.\\n\\nI'm certainly familiar with feelings of loss,\\n\\nfeelings of grief.\\n\\nAnd I've often struggled with this question of,\\n\\ngosh, do I try and just push it aside\\n\\nor do I deal with those feelings?\\n\\nAgain, this is something that you really need\\n\\nto determine for yourself.\\n\\nBut what these studies show pretty conclusively\\n\\nis that when we're feeling sad,\\n\\nmatching that sadness or amplifying that sadness\\n\\nby listening to sad music for 13 minutes or more\\n\\ncan help us move through that state of sadness.\\n\\nAnd one could argue this is more or less the use of catharsis\\n\\nof amplifying emotional expression or feeling\\n\\nin order to try and move that feeling out\\n\\nis a classic idea originating in Freudian psychology,\\n\\nbut probably before then as well.\\n\\nBut in any event, I think these data support the idea\\n\\nthat even when feeling sad, perhaps especially\\n\\nwhen feeling sad, amplifying or matching those feelings\\n\\nthrough the use of sad music for 13 minutes or more,\\n\\nagain, you don't need to set a timer for 13 minutes,\\n\\nbut giving yourself a period of time\\n\\nto just listen to that music is one way\\n\\nthat can help you move through that state of sadness\\n\\nand then be able to lean back into other areas of life.\\n\\nSo we've talked about the role of music\\n\\nin evoking or shifting states of happiness and sadness.\\n\\nThere are also interesting data\\n\\nthat support the use of music for shifting one\\n\\nout of a state of heightened anxiety.\\n\\nAnd I find this especially interesting\\n\\nbecause my laboratory for a long time\\n\\nhas worked on behavioral interventions to reduce anxiety,\\n\\nthings like the physiological sigh,\\n\\nwhich if you're not familiar with,\\n\\nyou can put physiological sigh in my last name\\n\\ninto YouTube and there's a demonstration of that.\\n\\nIt's a breathing technique of two inhales through the nose\\n\\nand a long exhale through the mouth to lungs empty\\n\\nthat at this point in time, we understand to be the fastest\\n\\nand most effective way to reduce one's levels of anxiety\\n\\nin real time.\\n\\nSo it's two inhales through the nose,\\n\\nlong to lungs empty, exhale through the mouth.\\n\\nThat's the physiological sigh.\\n\\nEarlier, we talked about the fact\\n\\nthat one of the main ways in which listening to music\\n\\nshifts heart rate and increases heart rate variability\\n\\nand thereby positively shifts a number\\n\\nof different health metrics is through shifts in breathing.\\n\\nSo I justify that brief vignette about the physiological sigh\\n\\nas within the general context\\n\\nof what we're talking about today.\\n\\nIn any event, there are data that have explored\\n\\nwhether or not specific musical stimuli can be used\\n\\nto significantly reduce anxiety.\\n\\nIn particular, one published\\n\\nout of the University of Pennsylvania\\n\\nand I'll provide a link to this study\\n\\nin the show note captions,\\n\\nwhich shows that people that listen to a particular song\\n\\nthat I'll describe in a moment\\n\\nexperience up to 65% reductions in their anxiety.\\n\\nThat's a significant reduction in anxiety.\\n\\nAnd I should point out that 65% reduction in anxiety\\n\\nin this case was accomplished with just three minutes\\n\\nof listening to this one particular song\\n\\nand get this, that particular song was as effective\\n\\nin reducing anxiety\\n\\nas one of the most commonly prescribed benzodiazepines.\\n\\nSo what is this magical anxiety reducing song?\\n\\nThe title of the song is Weightless by Marconi Union.\\n\\nI hadn't heard of this song\\n\\nprior to researching this episode.\\n\\nI did indeed look up the song on YouTube\\n\\nand listen to the song.\\n\\nI will provide a link to the song in the show note captions.\\n\\nI confess that it is a very relaxing song.\\n\\nI also confess that I was not experiencing anxiety\\n\\nwhen I listened to the song,\\n\\nbut it was successful in reducing my level\\n\\nof overall autonomic arousal.\\n\\nI found myself more relaxed, et cetera.\\n\\nNow, of course, what I'm describing\\n\\nin terms of my own experience is not a peer-reviewed study.\\n\\nIt's what I would call ANIC data,\\n\\nmeaning I'm just describing my experience.\\n\\nBut again, there are peer-reviewed studies\\n\\nexploring how this particular song\\n\\nshifts one's autonomic state.\\n\\nAnd I think this three minutes\\n\\nof listening to this one song\\n\\nshould at least be tried\\n\\nby anyone that's trying to reduce their anxiety.\\n\\nBecause unless you're listening to the song\\n\\nin some way that I'm not aware of,\\n\\nlike excessively loud or something of that sort,\\n\\nI can't imagine how listening to the song\\n\\nwould be detrimental in any way.\\n\\nAnd if you are anything like the subjects\\n\\nin the study that they explored,\\n\\nit could very well be beneficial\\n\\nand help you reduce your anxiety.\\n\\nIt's also something that you could keep queued up\\n\\nin your phone or on any device,\\n\\nsuch that if you think you may experience anxiety,\\n\\nyou just put your headphones in and listen to it.\\n\\nYou might be wondering whether or not\\n\\nMarconi Union's Waitlist is only three minutes long.\\n\\nWell, I don't know the answer to that\\n\\nbecause when you go on YouTube,\\n\\nwhat you'll see is that clearly a number of people\\n\\nare benefiting from listening to the song\\n\\nto reduce their anxiety,\\n\\nor at least that a number of people have listened\\n\\nto this song.\\n\\nBecause if you put Marconi Union Waitlist\\n\\ninto the search function on YouTube,\\n\\nwhat you'll quickly discover is that the top video has,\\n\\nget this, 47 million views.\\n\\nAnd it's 10 hours long.\\n\\nNow across today's episode,\\n\\nit's been in the back of my mind that some of you out there\\n\\nperhaps are trained musicians,\\n\\nthat you grew up playing an instrument,\\n\\nperhaps sang in choir or at school,\\n\\nperhaps you played multiple instruments,\\n\\nperhaps you even know music theory.\\n\\nWhereas others, such as myself,\\n\\nwere encouraged to play an instrument when we were younger,\\n\\nbut then abandoned that instrument.\\n\\nIn fact, I'll just tell you a brief story.\\n\\nWhen I was a kid,\\n\\nevery kid in school was required to pick an instrument.\\n\\nMy parents, for whatever reason,\\n\\nclearly they didn't ask me what I wanted to do.\\n\\nThey asked me to play the violin in school.\\n\\nAnd I got the violin.\\n\\nI started playing the violin.\\n\\nI took the Suzuki Method lessons.\\n\\nThis is where you don't learn to read music directly.\\n\\nThere's a number assignment to the different notes,\\n\\nand that's initially how you learn.\\n\\nI was also supposed to listen to the songs while I slept,\\n\\nthis idea that some of the music and musical learning\\n\\ncould be encoded during sleep.\\n\\nAn interesting topic,\\n\\nbecause there's actually some emerging evidence\\n\\nfor that now.\\n\\nBut at the time, as far as I know,\\n\\nthere were no peer-reviewed studies,\\n\\nbut nonetheless, I thought that this works,\\n\\nand perhaps it does.\\n\\nWell, I can tell you one thing for sure,\\n\\nit did not work for me,\\n\\nbecause I have one photo, and truly just one,\\n\\nfrom a concert that I played.\\n\\nI must have been about eight or nine years old.\\n\\nAnd within this photo,\\n\\nwhat you'll notice is there's a gallery of children,\\n\\nall with violins,\\n\\nall of whom's bows are up,\\n\\nand my bow is down.\\n\\nThat in addition to the fact that my fly was open\\n\\nin the picture,\\n\\nand the fact that every time I played the violin,\\n\\neither by practice or with the teacher present,\\n\\nwhen we would go to these once a week sessions\\n\\nwith an individual teacher,\\n\\npeople would cringe, animals would cringe,\\n\\nliterally dogs would howl,\\n\\nsuch that my parents did not encourage me\\n\\nto continue playing.\\n\\nIn fact, they and many others encouraged me to quit playing.\\n\\nSo I quit playing.\\n\\nI confess, I don't know how to play any instrument.\\n\\nI've attempted a few other instruments in my lifetime.\\n\\nYes, I believe in neuroplasticity.\\n\\nIt is a hallmark feature of our brain.\\n\\nOur brain can learn things, even as adults.\\n\\nBut the point I'm trying to make here\\n\\nis that I am not of the category of kids\\n\\nthat played an instrument,\\n\\nand understands music theory or how to read music.\\n\\nI simply don't.\\n\\nAnd I realized that those of you that are listening to this\\n\\nor watching this out there\\n\\nare probably in a mixed category of proficiency\\n\\nall the way down to what I would consider\\n\\nmy own relationship to music, which is deficiency.\\n\\nAlthough I greatly enjoy listening to music,\\n\\nand I do have a pretty good ability to memorize lyrics.\\n\\nIn any event, the reason I raise this\\n\\nis that there are now dozens, if not hundreds\\n\\nof quality peer-reviewed studies\\n\\nusing a variety of technical approaches\\n\\nthat show that when children,\\n\\nespecially children younger than eight,\\n\\nlearn to play an instrument,\\n\\nand even better, learn to play multiple instruments,\\n\\nregardless of whether or not they learn to read music,\\n\\nthat it leads to greatly enhanced connectivity\\n\\nwithin their brain that persists into adulthood,\\n\\nand that it facilitates other forms\\n\\nof neuroplasticity and learning,\\n\\nwhich is basically to say that my brain very likely\\n\\ndoes not include these enhanced circuits,\\n\\nwhich circuits am I referring to?\\n\\nWell, there are a number of different circuits\\n\\nin the brain that have been shown to expand\\n\\nwhen children learn how to play an instrument\\n\\nas a child, eight or younger.\\n\\nAnd again, eight isn't a strict cutoff,\\n\\nand I always have to highlight this, forgive the tangent,\\n\\nbut when we say eight or younger,\\n\\nI don't want people with nine-year-old children\\n\\nor a 10-year-old kid or even 16-year-old kid listening\\n\\nor even adult listening to think,\\n\\noh, the window is shut for me,\\n\\nbecause when one designs a study,\\n\\nyou have to have some thresholds\\n\\nof who you include and who you don't include,\\n\\nand sometimes that leads to these kind of\\n\\nartificial perceptions about where the cutoffs are,\\n\\nbut in any event, it's very clear\\n\\nthat if you did learn an instrument when you were young,\\n\\nor ideally even multiple instruments,\\n\\nand even better would be to learn multiple instruments\\n\\nand how to sing along with instrumentals,\\n\\nespecially in an improvised manner,\\n\\nwell, your brain has expanded connectivity on average\\n\\nrelative to children that did not have that experience.\\n\\nNow, the good news is that learning how to play\\n\\nan instrument or even, thankfully for me,\\n\\nlistening to novel forms of music,\\n\\nmusic that you don't typically listen to\\n\\nfor 30 to 60 minutes per day,\\n\\nand it doesn't have to be every day, in fact,\\n\\nit can even be just three days a week\\n\\nfor 30 to 60 minutes,\\n\\nhas been shown to expand brain connectivity\\n\\nin ways that, of course, lends itself\\n\\nto better musical comprehension and even performance,\\n\\nbut learning how to play a musical instrument at any age,\\n\\nas well as singing, and singing,\\n\\nespecially with others in a group,\\n\\nhas been shown to enhance learning\\n\\nand the acquisition of new skills\\n\\nseparate from musical learning and singing.\\n\\nIn other words, it seems that learning\\n\\nhow to play an instrument and singing\\n\\nare a gateway to neuroplasticity,\\n\\nand this is, again, supported by neuroimaging data.\\n\\nSome of the more striking of those data\\n\\nare that children that learned how to play\\n\\none to three instruments when they were a kid,\\n\\nor that sang in a choir or a group,\\n\\nor that were taught to sing solo, for that matter,\\n\\nshow up to 30% greater connectivity\\n\\nwithin this particular brain network\\n\\nthat links the two hemispheres of the brain.\\n\\nNow, as soon as I say two hemispheres of the brain,\\n\\nit starts drawing up a lot of ideas in people's heads,\\n\\nmainly derived from pop psychology,\\n\\nthat there are left-brained people and right-brained people.\\n\\nI've touched on this before,\\n\\nbut I want to make this abundantly clear again now.\\n\\nMost of what you've heard\\n\\nabout so-called left-brained people or right-brained people\\n\\nis complete and total nonsense.\\n\\nIt's myth.\\n\\nThere are some functions in the brain\\n\\nthat are lateralized to the left or the right hemisphere,\\n\\nin particular, prosody.\\n\\nThe sort of lilting and falling of speech and in singing\\n\\nis highly lateralized in the brain.\\n\\nOther aspects of language can be lateralized in the brain,\\n\\nbut really, if you hear that certain people\\n\\nare more emotional or certain people are more logical\\n\\nbased on right-brain, left-brain stuff,\\n\\nthat stuff is completely false.\\n\\nIt's complete garbage, in fact.\\n\\nIt's not based in any real solid data.\\n\\nSo when I say that learning an instrument\\n\\nor learning how to sing young or even as an adult\\n\\nis beneficial for increasing the connectivity\\n\\nbetween the two sides of the brain,\\n\\nwhat that increased connectivity\\n\\nbetween the two sides of the brain,\\n\\nwhich is, by the way, mediated through a structure\\n\\ncalled the corpus callosum,\\n\\nis not about enhancing one's emotional capacity\\n\\nor logical capacity.\\n\\nIt's really about increasing the capacity\\n\\nof all brain circuits,\\n\\nor at least the brain circuits\\n\\nthat are connected up directly with the corpus callosum,\\n\\nwhich includes many brain circuits\\n\\nfor things like cognition, language learning,\\n\\nspeech, mathematics.\\n\\nA lot of people don't realize this,\\n\\nbut a lot of musicians\\n\\nare also especially adept at mathematics.\\n\\nAnd for you musicians, you're probably nodding, of course,\\n\\nright, because music is grounded in theory\\n\\nthat has basis in math and in physics,\\n\\nsomething that we will address in a future episode\\n\\nabout harmonics, et cetera.\\n\\nWhen children or adults learn how to play\\n\\na musical instrument or several,\\n\\nor how to sing and play musical instruments,\\n\\nthat increased connectivity in the corpus callosum\\n\\nis essentially providing multiple highways of option\\n\\nfor learning all sorts of things.\\n\\nSo it's something that I highly encourage,\\n\\nso much so that I intend to finally, finally,\\n\\nlearn how to play an instrument.\\n\\nI've got a particular instrument in mind\\n\\nthat I've wanted to learn how to play for a very long time,\\n\\nbut based on my prior experience\\n\\nwith trying to learn an instrument,\\n\\nand because I like to consider myself\\n\\na considerate person,\\n\\nI intend to do this more or less in isolation from people\\n\\nand indeed from animals as well.\\n\\nAnd for those of you that don't have the time or energy\\n\\nor desire to learn new forms of music,\\n\\nyou'll be perhaps delighted to know\\n\\nthat just listening to novel forms of music,\\n\\nand in particular, when you listen to novel forms of music\\n\\nand you pay attention to that music,\\n\\nnot just letting it play in the background,\\n\\nthat too has been demonstrated to expand the brain's capacity\\n\\nfor neuroplasticity, its ability to modify itself\\n\\nand make it better at learning other sorts of things,\\n\\nboth cognitive and physical.\\n\\nSo I highly encourage you to listen to the music you love.\\n\\nI certainly love to listen to the music that I delight in\\n\\nand have for so many years,\\n\\nbut there's also strong scientific support\\n\\nto encourage listening to new forms of music\\n\\nthat hopefully you will like,\\n\\nbut nonetheless, the mere forging for\\n\\nand listening to novel forms of music itself\\n\\nseems to activate brain circuitry in a way\\n\\nthat allows for better learning and comprehension\\n\\nof all sorts of things.\\n\\nSo today we've been talking about music in the brain,\\n\\nand I confess, this is an enormous topic,\\n\\nso much so that I had to discard with entire sets of data\\n\\nand discussion around, for instance,\\n\\nthe mathematical structure of music\\n\\nand how that relates to the mathematical structure\\n\\nof firing of neurons.\\n\\nWe touched on this a little bit, however,\\n\\nin the context of certain frequencies of sounds\\n\\nthat we hear, creating certain frequencies\\n\\nof neuronal firing and activation in the brain.\\n\\nI mean, just think about that, how amazing that is.\\n\\nIt's literally like the brain playing your neurons\\n\\nlike a piano.\\n\\nThis is not what happens when you smell a particular odor\\n\\nor taste a particular taste\\n\\nor see a particular face or visual stimulus.\\n\\nIncredible things happen within those senses as well,\\n\\nbut there is something oh so fundamental and incredible\\n\\nabout music in its ability to tap into our neural circuitry\\n\\nand our neural chemistry in ways\\n\\nthat shift our emotional states and our motivational states.\\n\\nSo we talked about ways that music can be leveraged\\n\\nto shift our emotional and motivational states.\\n\\nAgain, not as a way to reduce music\\n\\nto its reductionist parts,\\n\\nbut rather to help us gain understanding\\n\\ninto how the brain responds to music\\n\\nand how we can leverage music of all kinds,\\n\\nwith and without lyrics,\\n\\nhow we can balance the contrast between music and silence\\n\\nto increase motivation and so on and so on.\\n\\nFor those of you that are interested\\n\\nin the more formal structure of music\\n\\nand how it relates to brain function and vice versa,\\n\\nas well as for those of you that are interested in singing\\n\\nand songwriting and more along the lines\\n\\nof lyrical content and how singing in groups\\n\\nand how improvisation of singing and musical playing\\n\\ncan impact brain function and plasticity,\\n\\nI promise you there's going to be both an expert guest\\n\\ncoming on the podcast to discuss that\\n\\nas well as a solo episode on those topics.\\n\\nAgain, the topic of music and the brain\\n\\nbeing far too vast to cover in just one conversation.\\n\\nWith that said, I hope that today's discussion\\n\\nallowed for you to think about music differently.\\n\\nHopefully it will lead you to listen to music\\n\\na bit differently, perhaps even leverage music\\n\\nfor different purposes in your life.\\n\\nAnd above all, to think about music and to enjoy music,\\n\\neither listening to it or playing it or both,\\n\\nbecause as you now know,\\n\\nmusic isn't just able to activate your brain,\\n\\nbut rather your brain contains\\n\\nvast amounts of real estate that are literally there\\n\\nto listen to music.\\n\\nIf you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast,\\n\\nplease subscribe to our YouTube channel.\\n\\nThat's a terrific

       " Document(page_content=\"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\n\\nwhere we discuss science\\n\\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\\n\\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\\n\\nand I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology\\n\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\n\\nToday, we are going to discuss the science and practice\\n\\nof flexibility and stretching.\\n\\nFlexibility and stretching are topics\\n\\nthat I believe do not receive nearly as much attention\\n\\nas they deserve.\\n\\nFor most people, the topics of flexibility and stretching\\n\\nbring to mind things like yoga, injury prevention,\\n\\nor maybe even contortionism.\\n\\nBut it turns out that flexibility and stretching\\n\\nare features that are built into our basic body plan.\\n\\nYoung children, young animals, and adults,\\n\\nand indeed older children and animals,\\n\\nall stretch and all have some degree of flexibility.\\n\\nIt turns out that having flexibility\\n\\nand our ability to stretch\\n\\nand the interaction between stretching and flexibility\\n\\nare fundamental to how we move,\\n\\nour ability to learn new movements,\\n\\nindeed also to prevent injury or repair injuries,\\n\\nand to offsetting and reducing inflammation\\n\\nthroughout the body.\\n\\nIn fact, today, I'm going to share with you\\n\\na remarkable set of studies that show\\n\\nthat stretching can actually adjust things like tumor growth.\\n\\nThis is work that was done by one of the major directors\\n\\nof the National Institutes of Health.\\n\\nSo today's discussion will start\\n\\nwith a description of the mechanisms,\\n\\nliterally the cells and the connections\\n\\nfrom your nervous system\\n\\nthat mediate flexibility and stretching.\\n\\nAnd I promise that I'll make that information\\n\\naccessible to you,\\n\\nwhether or not you have a biology background or not.\\n\\nThen with that information in hand,\\n\\nI'm going to present to you\\n\\nwhat the scientific literature says\\n\\nabout the best times and ways to stretch.\\n\\nEverything right down to the detail\\n\\nof how long to hold a stretch,\\n\\nwhether or not to hold a stretch at all,\\n\\nbecause it turns out there are multiple kinds of stretching.\\n\\nSo you can imagine you have stretches\\n\\nwhere you hold the stretch for a very long time\\n\\nand use as little momentum as possible.\\n\\nAnd then there's also what's called dynamic\\n\\nand ballistic stretching,\\n\\nwhere you're literally swinging your limbs,\\n\\ntrying to increase the range of motion.\\n\\nI will explain the science and application\\n\\nof flexibility and stretching\\n\\nin the context of sports performance,\\n\\nwhether or not you're engaging in cardiovascular exercise\\n\\nor resistance exercise or both,\\n\\nwhether or not you're a competitive athlete\\n\\nor simply a recreational exerciser, as I am,\\n\\nwhether or not you are trying to increase\\n\\nyour range of motion and flexibility for longevity purposes,\\n\\nor whether or not you're trying to do it\\n\\nin order to access different parts of your nervous system,\\n\\nbecause we'll soon learn today\\n\\nthat your ability to improve flexibility\\n\\nand indeed to engage in specific stretching exercises\\n\\ncan actually be used to powerfully modulate\\n\\nyour ability to tolerate pain,\\n\\nboth emotional and physical pain.\\n\\nSo this thing that we call flexibility and stretching\\n\\nis actually a vast landscape.\\n\\nWe're going to simplify and organize all that for you today.\\n\\nAnd by the end of today's episode,\\n\\nyou're going to have a number of simple,\\n\\neasy to apply tools that are grounded\\n\\nin the best scientific research\\n\\nthat you can apply for your specific goals.\\n\\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\\n\\nthat this podcast is separate\\n\\nfrom my teaching and research roles at Stanford.\\n\\nIt is, however, part of my desire and effort\\n\\nto bring zero cost to consumer information about science\\n\\nand science-related tools to the general public.\\n\\nIn keeping with that theme,\\n\\nI'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.\\n\\nOur first sponsor is Thesis.\\n\\nThesis makes custom nootropics\\n\\nthat are designed to get your brain and body\\n\\ninto the optimal state for the cognitive\\n\\nand physical things that you need to perform\\n\\nat the highest level.\\n\\nI have to confess, in fact, I've said it many times before,\\n\\nI am not a fan of the word nootropics\\n\\nbecause it means smart drugs.\\n\\nAnd frankly, as a neuroscientist,\\n\\nI'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge\\n\\nthat there's really no circuit in your brain\\n\\nfor being smart.\\n\\nYou have neural circuits in your brain\\n\\nthat are designed to get you to focus very well\\n\\nor to task switch very well or to be creative.\\n\\nThesis understands this.\\n\\nAnd as a consequence, they've designed nootropics\\n\\nthat are tailored to your specific needs\\n\\nin the cognitive and physical realm.\\n\\nWhat I mean by that is if you go to the Thesis site,\\n\\nyou fill out a short quiz,\\n\\nand they'll give you the opportunity to try a small kit\\n\\nof different nootropics with different ingredients.\\n\\nYou have the opportunity to try several different blends\\n\\nover the course of the month\\n\\nand discover which nootropics work best\\n\\nfor your unique brain chemistry and genetics.\\n\\nI've been using Thesis for about eight and a half months now,\\n\\nand I can confidently say\\n\\nthat their nootropics have been a game changer.\\n\\nTo get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,\\n\\nyou can go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nThere, you'll find that three-minute quiz,\\n\\nand Thesis will send you four different formulas\\n\\nto try in

InsideTracker.\\n\\nInsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform\\n\\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\\n\\nto help you better understand your body\\n\\nand help you reach your health goals.\\n\\nI've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done\\n\\nfor the simple reason that many of the factors\\n\\nthat impact your immediate and long-term health\\n\\ncan only be analyzed from a quality blood test.\\n\\nOne issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there\\n\\nis that you get information back about hormone levels,\\n\\nmetabolic factors, et cetera,\\n\\nbut you don't know what to do with that information.\\n\\nInsideTracker has a very easy-to-use personalized platform\\n\\nthat lets you look at those numbers,\\n\\nand then you can literally move your cursor\\n\\nover those numbers, and there are little pop-up windows\\n\\nthat will tell you the things that you can do\\n\\nin terms of lifestyle, so exercise,\\n\\nand nutrition, supplementation, and so on,\\n\\nto bring those numbers into the ranges\\n\\nthat are optimal for you.\\n\\nSo it really takes all the guesswork out of what to do\\n\\nwith that blood work and DNA information.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\\n\\nyou can visit InsideTracker.com slash Huberman\\n\\nto get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.\\n\\nJust use the code Huberman at

by 8 Sleep.\\n\\n8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers\\n\\nthat have cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.\\n\\nAnd indeed, you can dial in,\\n\\nyou can literally program the temperature\\n\\nof your sleeping environment from the time you go to sleep\\n\\nuntil the time you wake up in the morning.\\n\\nThis turns out to be immensely powerful\\n\\nbecause, as I've talked about on the podcast before,\\n\\nin order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep\\n\\nthroughout the night,\\n\\nyour body has to drop by about one to three degrees,\\n\\nand waking up in the morning actually involves a warming up\\n\\nof your body temperature.\\n\\nFor many people, they just can't precisely control\\n\\ntheir sleep environment well enough\\n\\nin order for all that to go well.\\n\\nI was one such person, so for a long time,\\n\\nI'd fall asleep pretty easily,\\n\\nbut then I'd wake up in the middle of the night.\\n\\nI tended to run warm,\\n\\nbut then sometimes I'd feel really tired in the morning\\n\\nas if I couldn't wake up.\\n\\nI started sleeping on an eight-sleep mattress cover.\\n\\nI programmed it so that the temperature\\n\\nwould be rather cool in the early part of the evening\\n\\nwhen I would get into bed,\\n\\nand then would drop into the deeper phases of the night\\n\\nwhen I was entering deep sleep,\\n\\nand then rapid eye movement sleep,\\n\\nand then would warm towards morning.\\n\\nIt would help me wake up quickly.\\n\\nAnd as a consequence, I'm sleeping throughout the night now,\\n\\nand I'm waking up feeling completely refreshed.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try an eight-sleep mattress cover,\\n\\nyou can go to eightsleep.com slash Huberman\\n\\nto check out the ProPod cover\\n\\nand save $150 at checkout.\\n\\nEight-sleep

stretching.\\n\\nBefore we talk about the practices\\n\\nof flexibility and stretching,\\n\\nI'd like to just highlight some of the features\\n\\nthat are already built into your nervous system\\n\\nand into your body that allow you to be flexible.\\n\\nSome of us feel tighter than others,\\n\\nsometimes in specific limbs or areas of our body.\\n\\nSome people feel really loose and limber.\\n\\nSome people even have what's called a hyper-flexibility.\\n\\nI, for instance, have a relative that can take her fingers\\n\\nand bend them back to the point where they touch her wrist,\\n\\nand it always makes me cringe a little bit,\\n\\nbut she can do that without any pain.\\n\\nShe seems to have some hyper-flexibility in her joints.\\n\\nI do not have that feature.\\n\\nSome of you may find that you are more flexible\\n\\nthan others naturally.\\n\\nAnd some of you might be thinking,\\n\\nyou don't need to build in additional flexibility.\\n\\nWell, I think by the end of today's episode,\\n\\nyou'll realize that almost all of us can benefit\\n\\nfrom having some sort of understanding about flexibility\\n\\nand having some stretching protocol\\n\\nthat we incorporate into our life,\\n\\nif not just for physical performance reasons\\n\\nand for postural reasons,\\n\\nthen also for cognitive and mental reasons.\\n\\nAnd I'll be sure to clarify what all of that means.\\n\\nRight now, I'd like to take a moment\\n\\nand just highlight the flexibility\\n\\nthat you already have.\\n\\nFor instance, if you were to move your arm\\n\\nbehind your torso a little bit and then sort of let go\\n\\nor stop exerting any effort in doing that,\\n\\nyou would find that the limb would return more or less\\n\\nto a position next to your torso, at least I would hope so.\\n\\nWhy is that?\\n\\nWell, it turns out that there are aspects\\n\\nof your nervous system, aspects of your skeletal system,\\n\\naspects of your muscles and aspects of the connective tissue\\n\\nthat binds all of that together,\\n\\nthat try and restore a particular order or position\\n\\nto your limbs and your limbs relative to one another.\\n\\nSo that reflects a very specific set of processes\\n\\nthat it turns out are the same set of processes\\n\\nthat you use when you are trying\\n\\nto enhance flexibility and stretching.\\n\\nSo I'd like to just take a moment\\n\\nand review the basic elements of nervous system,\\n\\nmuscle, connective tissue and skeletal tissue, bone,\\n\\nthat allow for flexibility and stretching.\\n\\nAnd here we can point to two major mechanisms\\n\\nby which your nervous system, neurons, meaning nerve cells,\\n\\ncommunicate with muscles and those muscles communicate\\n\\nback to your nervous system to make sure\\n\\nthat your limbs don't stretch too far,\\n\\nthey don't move too far such that you get injured.\\n\\nAnd in addition to that,\\n\\nmechanisms that ensure that you don't overload\\n\\nyour muscles too much with weight or with tension\\n\\nor with effort and damage them that way.\\n\\nBecause it turns out that the second security mechanism\\n\\nof making sure that you don't overload muscles\\n\\ncan be leveraged toward increasing your flexibility\\n\\nalmost immediately.\\n\\nThat's right.\\n\\nThere are protocols and tools that I'll share with you\\n\\nthat are going to allow you to vastly improve\\n\\nyour flexibility over time,\\n\\nbut there are also mechanisms that allow you\\n\\nto quite significantly increase your degree of flexibility\\n\\nin a very short period of time within just a few seconds.\\n\\nSo let's establish some of the basic biological mechanisms.\\n\\nAnytime we talk about biology or physiology,\\n\\nwe're going to talk about structure,\\n\\nmeaning the cells and their connections and functions,\\n\\nwhat they do.\\n\\nThey're just a few names to understand.\\n\\nYou do not have to memorize these names.\\n\\nThe important thing that I'd like you to know\\n\\nis that flexibility and the process of stretching\\n\\nand getting more flexible involves three major components.\\n\\nNeural, meaning of the nervous system,\\n\\nmuscular, muscles, and connective tissue.\\n\\nConnective tissue is the stuff that surrounds\\n\\nthe neural stuff and the muscular stuff,\\n\\nalthough it's all kind of weaved together\\n\\nand braided together in complicated ways.\\n\\nSome of you may have heard of fascia.\\n\\nWe're going to talk a little bit about fascia today,\\n\\nalthough it's such an interesting tissue\\n\\nthat's really deserving of its own episode.\\n\\nFacial tissue, we're going to talk about some of the stuff\\n\\nthat surrounds muscles that really gives you your shape\\n\\nand holds everything together\\n\\nand allows for flexibility to occur.\\n\\nSo here's a key thing that everyone should know,\\n\\nwhether or not you're talking about flexibility or not.\\n\\nYour nervous system controls your muscles.\\n\\nIt's what gets your muscles to contract.\\n\\nSo within your spinal cord,\\n\\nyou have a category of neurons, nerve cells,\\n\\nthat are called motor neurons.\\n\\nTo be precise, they are lower motor neurons\\n\\nbecause they're in your spinal cord.\\n\\nWe call them lower to distinguish them\\n\\nfrom the motor neurons that are in your brain\\n\\nup in your skull.\\n\\nThose lower motor neurons,\\n\\nhereafter I'll just refer to them as motor neurons.\\n\\nIf I want to talk about the other kind of motor neurons,\\n\\nI'll say upper motor neurons.\\n\\nSo if I say motor neurons,\\n\\nI just mean the ones in your spinal cord.\\n\\nThose motor neurons send a little wire or set of wires\\n\\nout to your muscles.\\n\\nAnd that creates what's called a neuromuscular junction,\\n\\nwhich just means that the neurons meet the muscles\\n\\nat a particular place.\\n\\nThose neurons release a chemical.\\n\\nThat chemical is called acetylcholine.\\n\\nSome of you may have heard about acetylcholine before.\\n\\nAcetylcholine also exists in your brain\\n\\nand does other things in your brain.\\n\\nMainly it's involved in focus and attention.\\n\\nBut at the neuromuscular junction,\\n\\nthe release of acetylcholine from these nerve cells,\\n\\nthese neurons onto the muscles,\\n\\ncauses the muscles to contract.\\n\\nAnd when muscles contract,\\n\\nthey are able to move limbs\\n\\nby way of changing the length of the muscle,\\n\\nadjusting the function of connective tissue\\n\\nlike tendons and ligaments.\\n\\nAnd for instance, if you're bringing your wrist\\n\\ncloser to your shoulder,\\n\\nthat biceps muscle is contracting.\\n\\nIt's getting shorter.\\n\\nI mean, in reality, it hasn't gotten shorter overall.\\n\\nIt's just temporarily shorter, of course.\\n\\nAll of that is controlled by neurons.\\n\\nAnd it's those motor neurons from the spinal cord\\n\\nthat are really responsible for the major movement\\n\\nof your limbs by way of causing contraction\\n\\nof specific muscles at specific times.\\n\\nSo the key thing to take away is that nerve\\n\\ncontrols the contraction of muscles.\\n\\nNow, within the muscles themselves,\\n\\nthere are nerve connections.\\n\\nAnd these are nerve connections that arise\\n\\nfrom a different set of neurons in the spinal cord\\n\\nthat we call sensory neurons.\\n\\nThe sensory neurons exist in a different part\\n\\nof the spinal cord, and they send a little wire\\n\\nor set of wires into the muscles.\\n\\nAnd there's a particular kind of sensory neuron\\n\\nthat comes out of your spinal cord and into your muscles,\\n\\nwhich are called spindle neurons.\\n\\nThey create or they actually wrap around muscle fibers\\n\\nand corkscrew around them.\\n\\nThey give kind of a spring-like appearance.\\n\\nIf for you aficionados out there,\\n\\nthese are intrafusal connections or neurons.\\n\\nIntrafusal means within the muscle,\\n\\nbut you really don't need to know that\\n\\nunless you're really curious about it,\\n\\nor you're going to become a neuroscientist\\n\\nor you're in medical school or something.\\n\\nThese spindle connections within the muscle\\n\\nthat wrap around the muscle fibers,\\n\\nsense the stretch of those muscle fibers.\\n\\nSo now we have two parts to the system that I've described.\\n\\nYou've got motor neurons that can cause muscles to contract\\n\\nand shorten, and we have these spindles\\n\\nwithin the muscles themselves\\n\\nthat wrap around the muscle fibers.\\n\\nAnd that information is sent from the muscle\\n\\nback to the spinal cord.\\n\\nIt's a form of sensing what's going on in the muscle,\\n\\nmuch in the same way that you have neurons in your eye\\n\\nthat sense light in your external environment.\\n\\nYou have neurons in your ear that sense sound waves\\n\\nin your external environment.\\n\\nYou have neurons in your spinal cord\\n\\nthat are sensory neurons that are sensing\\n\\nthe amount of stretch in the muscles.\\n\\nWhat happens is if a given muscle is stretching really far,\\n\\nthose sensory neurons, those spindles within the muscle\\n\\nwill activate and will send a electrical potential,\\n\\nliterally a bit of electricity along that wire's length\\n\\ninto the spinal cord.\\n\\nAnd then within the spinal cord,\\n\\nthat sensory neuron communicates\\n\\nthrough a series of intermediate steps,\\n\\nbut to the motor neuron and make sure\\n\\nthat that motor neuron contracts.\\n\\nNow, why would that be useful?\\n\\nWell, what this does is it creates a situation\\n\\nwhere if a muscle is stretching too much\\n\\nbecause the range of motion of a limb is increased too much,\\n\\nthen the muscle will contract to bring that limb range\\n\\nof motion into a safe range again.\\n\\nNow, what determines whether or not a range of motion\\n\\nis quote unquote safe or not\\n\\nis dictated by a number of things.\\n\\nIt's dictated by things that are happening\\n\\nin this kind of loop of neural connections\\n\\nin the spinal cord and muscle.\\n\\nIt's also determined by what's going on in your head,\\n\\nliterally in your mind, cognitively,\\n\\nabout whether or not the movement of that limb,\\n\\nits increasing range of motion is good for you,\\n\\nwhether or not you're doing it deliberately,\\n\\nwhether or not it's bad for you.\\n\\nAnd then there are also some basic safety mechanisms\\n\\nthat are put in there that really try\\n\\nand restrict our limb range of motion.\\n\\nOkay, so just to clarify,\\n\\nthis whole thing looks like a loop\\n\\nand the essential components of the loop are\\n\\nmotor neurons contract muscles, sensory neurons\\n\\nof which there are a bunch of different varieties\\n\\nof in this case, what we're calling the spindles\\n\\nare sensing stretch within the muscles.\\n\\nAnd if a given muscle is elongating\\n\\nbecause of the increased range of motion of a limb,\\n\\nthose sensory neurons send an electrical signal\\n\\ninto the spinal cord such that there is an activation\\n\\nof the motor neuron, which by now should make perfect sense\\n\\nas to why that's useful.\\n\\nIt then shortens up the muscle.\\n\\nIt actually doesn't really shorten the muscle,\\n\\nbut contracts the muscle that brings the limb back\\n\\ninto a safe range of motion.\\n\\nOkay, so this process is very fast.\\n\\nIt was designed to keep your body together and safe.\\n\\nIt's designed to make sure that you don't take your arm\\n\\nand swing it behind your torso\\n\\nand it just goes all the way back to the middle of your back.\\n\\nI mean, unless you're a contortionist,\\n\\nor you've trained that kind of level of flexibility,\\n\\nthat would be terrible because it could provide\\n\\na lot of damage to the muscles\\n\\nand to the connective tissue and so forth.\\n\\nSo that's one basic mechanism that we want to hold in mind.\\n\\nThis idea of a spindle that senses stretch\\n\\nand can activate contraction of the muscles\\n\\nand shorten the muscles.\\n\\nThe next mechanism I want to describe,\\n\\nand once again, there are only two\\n\\nthat you need to hold in mind for this episode.\\n\\nThis other mechanism has a lot of the same features\\n\\nas the one I just described,\\n\\nbut it has less to do with stretch.\\n\\nIn fact, it doesn't have to do with stretch\\n\\nas much as it has to do with sensing loads.\\n\\nSo at the end of each muscles, you have tendons typically,\\n\\nand there are neurons that are closely associated\\n\\nwith those tendons that are called Golgi tendon organs.\\n\\nThese are neurons that are sensory neurons\\n\\nthat sense how much load is on a given muscle.\\n\\nSo if you're lifting up something very, very heavy,\\n\\nthese neurons are going to fire,\\n\\nmeaning they're going to send electrical activity\\n\\ninto the spinal cord.\\n\\nAnd then those neurons have the ability to shut down,\\n\\nnot activate, but shut down motor neurons\\n\\nand to prevent the contraction of a given muscle.\\n\\nSo for instance, if you were to walk over\\n\\nand try and pick up a weight that is much too heavy for you,\\n\\nmeaning you could not do it without injuring yourself\\n\\nand you start to try and heave that weight off the ground,\\n\\nthere are a number of reasons\\n\\nwhy you might not be able to lift it.\\n\\nBut let's say you start to get it a little bit\\n\\noff the ground or you start to get some force generated\\n\\nthat would allow it to move.\\n\\nBut the force that you're generating could potentially\\n\\nrip your muscles or your tendons off of the bone, right?\\n\\nThat it could disrupt the joints and it could tear ligaments.\\n\\nWell, you have a safety mechanism in place.\\n\\nIt's these Golgi tendon organs, these GTOs as they're called,\\n\\nthat get activated and shut down the motor neurons\\n\\nand make it impossible for those muscles to contract.\\n\\nOkay, so on the one hand, we have a mechanism\\n\\nthat senses stretch and can figure out\\n\\nwhen stretch is excessive.\\n\\nAnd when the system detects that stretch is excessive,\\n\\nit activates the contraction of muscles.\\n\\nAnd then we have a second mechanism that senses loads.\\n\\nAnd when tension or loads is deemed excessive\\n\\nby these circuits, and remember these circuits\\n\\ndon't have a mind, they don't go, oh, this is excessive.\\n\\nThey just sense loads.\\n\\nAnd when those loads exceed a certain threshold,\\n\\nwell, then those GTOs, those Golgi tendon organs\\n\\nsend signals into the spinal cord\\n\\nthat shut down your motor neurons ability\\n\\nto contract muscles so that you no longer\\n\\ncan lift that heavy load.\\n\\nSo both of these are protective mechanisms,\\n\\nbut both of these can be leveraged in a very logical way\\n\\nand in a very safe way in order to increase\\n\\nyour limb range of motion.\\n\\nSo there are a couple of things I want to point out\\n\\nbefore going a little bit further\\n\\ninto how your nervous system controls flexibility\\n\\nand stretching.\\n\\nAnd those key points are the following.\\n\\nThere are now dozens, if not hundreds of studies\\n\\nthat show that a dedicated stretching practice\\n\\ncan improve limb range of motion.\\n\\nNow, for many of you listening, you're probably saying duh,\\n\\nbut I think it's important to point that out,\\n\\nthat a dedicated stretching practice\\n\\ncan increase limb range of motion.\\n\\nAnd as you'll soon learn, there are specific mechanisms\\n\\nthat can explain that effect.\\n\\nThe second point is one of longevity.\\n\\nAnd when I say longevity, I don't necessarily mean\\n\\nlate stage aging.\\n\\nWe all undergo a decrease in limb range of motion\\n\\nunless we do something to offset that decrease.\\n\\nAnd the current numbers vary from study to study,\\n\\nbut if you look en masse, you look at all of those studies,\\n\\nand what you basically find is that we start to experience\\n\\na decrease in flexibility from about age 20\\n\\nuntil about age 49, that's pretty dramatic.\\n\\nAnd then of course it will continue after age 49.\\n\\nBut basically it's a 10% decrease every 10 years.\\n\\nSo we could say it's a 1% decrease per year,\\n\\nalthough it's not necessarily linear.\\n\\nWhat do I mean by that?\\n\\nWell, it's not necessarily that on your 21st birthday,\\n\\nyou are 1% less flexible than you were on your 20th birthday\\n\\nand it decreases by 1% per year.\\n\\nSome of these changes can be non-linear.\\n\\nSo you can imagine the person who's doing just fine\\n\\nin terms of flexibility between 20 and 30,\\n\\nand then, you know, they get to 32\\n\\nand suddenly they've lost 5% of their flexibility.\\n\\nNow, of course there will be a ton of lifestyle factors.\\n\\nIf you're a regular practitioner of yoga,\\n\\nif you have a dedicated stretching practice,\\n\\nif you're doing other things to improve\\n\\nyour muscle contractibility,\\n\\nso you're doing resistance training, it turns out,\\n\\ncan actually indirectly improve flexibility.\\n\\nThere are a number of different factors.\\n\\nBut the key point is that maintaining some degree\\n\\nof flexibility and maybe even enhancing range of motion\\n\\nand flexibility is of immense benefit\\n\\nfor offsetting injury provided it's not pushed too far.\\n\\nThere are a number of people\\n\\nwho have pushed their limb range of motion so far\\n\\nthat they experience all sorts of injuries,\\n\\nboth acute and chronic injuries.\\n\\nToday, we'll also talk about how to avoid those scenarios.\\n\\nOkay, so we've established that there are mechanisms\\n\\nwithin the spinal cord, muscles, and connective tissue.\\n\\nRemember, it's the motor neurons, the spindles,\\n\\nthe GTOs, and of course the muscles themselves,\\n\\nand connective tissue, tendons,\\n\\nbut also other forms of connective tissue,\\n\\nthat establish whether or not a limb is going to stay\\n\\nwithin a particular range of motion or not,\\n\\nand whether or not a limb is going to be allowed\\n\\nby the nervous system to pursue or handle a given load,\\n\\na given tension.\\n\\nThere are also mechanisms that arrive\\n\\nto the neuromuscular system\\n\\nfrom higher up in the nervous system, from the brain.\\n\\nAnd those mechanisms involve a couple of different facets\\n\\nthat are really interesting,\\n\\nand I think that we should all know about.\\n\\nIn fact, today I'm going to teach you about a set of neurons\\n\\nthat I'm guessing 99.9% of you have never heard of,\\n\\nincluding all you neuroscientists out there,\\n\\nif you're out there, and I know you're out there,\\n\\nthat seem uniquely enriched in humans\\n\\nand probably perform essential roles in our ability\\n\\nto regulate our physiology and our emotional state.\\n\\nSo within the brain, we have the ability to sense things\\n\\nin the external world, something we called exteroception,\\n\\nand we have the ability to sense things in our internal world\\n\\nwithin our body called interoception.\\n\\nInteroception can be the volume of food in your gut,\\n\\nwhether or not you're experiencing any organ pain\\n\\nor discomfort, whether or not you feel good in your gut\\n\\nand in your organs, that's actually kind of feeling,\\n\\nI feel great, I feel sated, I feel relaxed.\\n\\nThose are all different forms of interoception.\\n\\nThe main brain area that's associated with interpreting\\n\\nwhat's going on in our body is called the insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.\\n\\nIt's a very interesting brain region.\\n\\nIt's got two major parts.\\n\\nThe front of it is mainly concerned with things like smell\\n\\nand to some extent, vision, and to some extent,\\n\\nother things that are arriving from the external world\\n\\nand combining with what's going on internally\\n\\nand making sense of all that,\\n\\nor at least routing that information elsewhere\\n\\nin your nervous system to make decision,\\n\\nlike if you smell something good to approach it\\n\\nor if you smell something bad to avoid it.\\n\\nThe front of the insula is really doing\\n\\nall of that kind of stuff, along with other brain areas.\\n\\nThe posterior insula, the back of the insula, that is,\\n\\nhas a very interesting and distinct set of functions.\\n\\nThe posterior insula is mainly concerned\\n\\nwith what's going on with your somatic experience.\\n\\nHow do you feel internally?\\n\\nAnd how is the movement that you happen to be doing\\n\\ncombining with your internal state\\n\\nto allow you to feel, as I like to say,\\n\\nthe nervous system mainly batches things into yum,\\n\\nlike, oh, this is really good for me,\\n\\nyuck, this is really bad for me, and I need to stop,\\n\\nor meh, this is kind of neutral, okay?\\n\\nSo this isn't about food, but we could say\\n\\nfor most stimuli, most senses,\\n\\nwhether or not they're senses of things internally\\n\\nor externally, our nervous system is trying\\n\\nto make decisions about what to do with that information,\\n\\nand so it mainly batches information into yum,\\n\\nI want to keep doing this or approach this thing,\\n\\nor continue down some path of movement or eating\\n\\nor staying in a temperature environment, et cetera,\\n\\nor yuck, I need to get out of here,\\n\\nI don't want any more of this,\\n\\nI don't want to keep doing this,\\n\\nthis is painful or aversive or stressful,\\n\\nand then meh, sorry if it doesn't really matter,\\n\\nI can just kind of stay right here or not, yum, yuck, and meh.\\n\\nWell, in your posterior insula,\\n\\nyou have a very interesting population\\n\\nof very large neurons,\\n\\nthese are exceptionally large neurons,\\n\\ncalled van-economo neurons,\\n\\nthese are neurons that are, again,\\n\\nunbeknownst to most neuroscientists,\\n\\nand they seem uniquely enriched in humans.\\n\\nChimpanzees have them,\\n\\nand some other large animals have them,\\n\\nso they're found in whales, chimpanzees,\\n\\nelephants, and in humans,\\n\\nbut even though we are much smaller than most whales,\\n\\nand even though we are much smaller than most elephants,\\n\\nI mean, remember there are baby elephants,\\n\\nas far as I know they haven't bred up\\n\\nlike mini elephants yet,\\n\\nthey seem to have a teacup version\\n\\nof pretty much every dog breed,\\n\\nyou can look that up,\\n\\nI certainly have mixed feelings about this notion\\n\\nof trying to downsize everything\\n\\nto the point where you could kind of like,\\n\\nthe pocket-sized bulldog I think someday will arrive,\\n\\nI'm not a fan of that kind of downsizing\\n\\nof different breeds,\\n\\nbut because there aren't teacup elephants,\\n\\nand teacup gorillas, and teacup chimpanzees, and so forth,\\n\\nmost all of those other species are larger than us,\\n\\nthey have these van-economo neurons,\\n\\nand we have these van-economo neurons,\\n\\nbut we have in upwards of 80,000 of these things\\n\\nin our posterior insula,\\n\\nthese other species tend to have somewhere in the range\\n\\nof a thousand to maybe 10,000 or so,\\n\\nwhy is that interesting?\\n\\nWell, these van-economo neurons have the unique property\\n\\nof integrating our knowledge about our body movements,\\n\\nour sense of pain and discomfort,\\n\\nand can drive motivational processes\\n\\nthat allow us to lean into discomfort,\\n\\nand indeed to overcome any discomfort,\\n\\nif we decide that the discomfort that we are experiencing\\n\\nis good for us or directed toward a specific goal.\\n\\nThis knowledge turns out to be very important\\n\\nto keep in mind,\\n\\nbecause as we migrate this conversation\\n\\ntoward the things that we can do\\n\\nto enhance flexibility in stretching,\\n\\nyou'll soon learn that there are moments\\n\\nwithin a stretching protocol\\n\\nwhere you have the opportunity\\n\\nto either override pain and discomfort,\\n\\nto kind of relax through it or push through it, right?\\n\\nThere's a decision fork in the road there,\\n\\nand I'll tell you which fork in the road to take,\\n\\nor to say, uh-uh, I'm not going to do that.\\n\\nI'm going to allow these natural reflexes of the spindle\\n\\nto kick in and just essentially stop me from stretching\\n\\nif a given limb isn't designed\\n\\nor shouldn't be stretched that far.\\n\\nSo I'd like you to keep these van-economo neurons in mind.\\n\\nI should mention they're named van-economo\\n\\nbecause the guy, Constantine van-economo,\\n\\nthat discovered them at the end of the 1800s, early 1900s,\\n\\ndecided to name them after himself, as many scientists do,\\n\\nor certainly the neurologists and physicians are famous\\n\\nfor naming things after themselves.\\n\\nThese van-economo neurons turn out to be very important\\n\\nto keep in mind as we embark on our exploration\\n\\nof what sorts of stretching practices\\n\\ncan be best applied to increase flexibility,\\n\\nbecause whether or not you undertake a mild, moderate,\\n\\nor intense flexibility training,\\n\\nyou will no doubt encounter a scenario at some point\\n\\nwhere you will have to ask yourself,\\n\\ndo I quote unquote, relax into this stretch,\\n\\nor do I try and push through\\n\\njust a little bit of discomfort?\\n\\nAnd I'll explain how to gauge that decision\\n\\nin a very specific and ideally safe way.\\n\\nAnd I'll give you some tools\\n\\nthat will allow you to make that decision\\n\\nin the way that best preserves the integrity\\n\\nof those neural circuits that I described earlier\\n\\nand can keep you safe.\\n\\nThese van-economo neurons sit in the exact position\\n\\nthat one would want to be able to evaluate\\n\\nwhat's going on in the body,\\n\\nin particular, what's going on in terms of limb movements,\\n\\nhow that relates to our feelings of discomfort.\\n\\nAnd then there's the other aspect\\n\\nof these van-economo neurons,\\n\\nwhich is that these van-economo neurons\\n\\nare connected to a number of different brain areas\\n\\nthat can shift our internal state\\n\\nfrom one of so-called sympathetic activation.\\n\\nSo this is a pattern of alertness and even stress,\\n\\nsometimes even panic, but typically alertness and stress,\\n\\nto one of so-called parasympathetic activation,\\n\\nto one of relaxation.\\n\\nOftentimes you'll hear that stretching should be done\\n\\nby relaxing into the stretch.\\n\\nWell, what does it actually mean to relax into the stretch?\\n\\nWell, these van-economo neurons sit at this junction\\n\\nwhere they're able to evaluate\\n\\nwhat's going on inside our body\\n\\nand allow us to access neural circuitries\\n\\nby which we can shift our relative level of alertness\\n\\ndown a bit, or our relative level of stress down a bit,\\n\\nand thereby to increase\\n\\nso-called parasympathetic activation\\n\\nand to literally override some of those spindle mechanisms,\\n\\neven the GTO mechanisms,\\n\\nbut especially the spindle mechanisms\\n\\nat the neuromuscular and muscular spinal junction.\\n\\nAnd in that way, gently, subtly override the reflex\\n\\nthat would otherwise cause us to contract those muscles back.\\n\\nThe reason that's possible is because your brain\\n\\nhas those other kinds of motor neurons,\\n\\nthe upper motor neurons that can both direct,\\n\\nmeaning control, and can override lower motor neurons.\\n\\nI'll give you a brief example of this\\n\\nthat you've already done in your life\\n\\nand that we all have the capacity for.\\n\\nWhat I'm referring to is the monosynaptic stretch reflex.\\n\\nThis is something that every first year\\n\\nneuroscience graduate student learns,\\n\\nwhich is that if you were to step on a sharp object\\n\\nwith a bare foot,\\n\\nyou would not need to make the decision to retract your foot.\\n\\nYou would automatically do that,\\n\\nprovided you have a healthy nervous system.\\n\\nThere are mechanisms in place\\n\\nthat cause the retraction of that limb\\n\\nby way of ensuring that the proper muscles contract\\n\\nand other muscles do not contract,\\n\\nin fact, that they fully relax, okay?\\n\\nSo in the case of stepping on a sharp object,\\n\\nlike a piece of glass or a nail or a tack,\\n\\nyou would essentially activate the hip flexor\\n\\nto lift up your foot as quickly as possible.\\n\\nIn doing so, that same neural circuit\\n\\nwould activate a contralateral,\\n\\nmeaning opposite side of the body circuit,\\n\\nto ensure that the leg, the foot,\\n\\nthat's not stepping on the sharp object\\n\\nwould do exactly the opposite and would extend\\n\\nto make sure that you don't fall over.\\n\\nAll of that happens reflexively.\\n\\nIt does not require any thought or decision-making.\\n\\nIn fact, humans without any neocortex,\\n\\nliterally who are decerebrate\\n\\nor an animal that doesn't have,\\n\\nand when I say decerebrate,\\n\\nI mean lack of cerebral cortex,\\n\\nthey can perform that because it's all controlled\\n\\nby circuits that are basically below the brain\\n\\nand in the spinal cord.\\n\\nThere's a little bit of activation of circuits\\n\\nin the kind of deeper parts of the brain,\\n\\nbut basically you don't need to think or decide\\n\\nin order to do that.\\n\\nHowever, if your life depended\\n\\non walking across some sharp objects,\\n\\nlet's say, let's make it a little less dramatic,\\n\\nso it's not like the Die Hard movie or something\\n\\nwhere he has to run barefoot across the glass,\\n\\nalthough that's a pretty good example\\n\\nof what I'm describing here,\\n\\nbut let's say you had to walk across some very hot stones\\n\\nto get away from something that you wanted to avoid.\\n\\nYou could override that stretch reflex\\n\\nby way of a decision made with your upper motor neurons,\\n\\nyour insula and your cognition\\n\\nand almost certainly those van economy neurons,\\n\\nwhich would be screaming,\\n\\ndon't do this, don't do this, don't do this,\\n\\ncould shuttle that information to brain areas\\n\\nthat would allow you to override the reflex\\n\\nand essentially push through the pain.\\n\\nAnd maybe even, in fact, even,\\n\\nnot experience the pain to the same degree or even at all.\\n\\nSo these van economy neurons sit\\n\\nat a very important junction within the brain.\\n\\nThey pay attention to what's going on in your body,\\n\\npain, pleasure, et cetera,\\n\\nand that includes what's going on with your limbs\\n\\nand your limb range of motion.\\n\\nThey also are paying attention\\n\\nand can control the amount of activation,\\n\\nkind of alertness or calmness\\n\\nthat you are able to create within your body\\n\\nin response to a given sensory experience.\\n\\nAnd as I mentioned before,\\n\\nthey seem to be uniquely enriched in humans.\\n\\nThey seem to be related to the aspects of our evolution\\n\\nthat allow us to make decisions\\n\\nabout what to do with our body\\n\\nin ways that other animals just simply can't.\\n\\nBefore we go any further,\\n\\nI want to give you a practical tool\\n\\nthat you can of course use,\\n\\nbut that will also give you insight and experience\\n\\ninto your muscle spindle spinal cord circuit mechanisms.\\n\\nSo what I'd like you to do\\n\\nis if you're in a proper place to do this,\\n\\nyou're going to stand with legs straight,\\n\\nmeaning knees not bent,\\n\\nand you're going to try and touch your toes,\\n\\nor for some of you, that's going to be very easy\\n\\nand you might even be able to put your hands\\n\\nflat on the floor.\\n\\nI don't have that kind of flexibility.\\n\\nIt's pretty easy for me to touch my toes.\\n\\nI don't care if you round your back or not,\\n\\nalthough ideally I would say don't round your back,\\n\\nnot because it's bad to do so necessarily,\\n\\nbut just to try and keep this the same\\n\\nfrom trial to trial, as it were.\\n\\nSo try and get a sense of what your range of motion is\\n\\nin terms of bending over at the waist\\n\\nwhile maintaining a flat back\\n\\nand trying to touch your toes or even touch the floor.\\n\\nMaybe again, you can even go hands flat to the floor,\\n\\nmaybe even far out in front of you.\\n\\nOkay, now what I'd like you to do is stand back up\\n\\nand I'd like you to contract your quadriceps\\n\\nas hard as you possibly can for about five to 15 seconds,\\n\\nlet's say 10 seconds,\\n\\njust to keep things more or less normalized.\\n\\nThis obviously is not a super controlled experiment.\\n\\nSo to contract your quadriceps,\\n\\nfor those of you that don't know,\\n\\nyou're going to extend your lower limb out.\\n\\nSo this would be like kicking,\\n\\nalthough don't do it too quickly.\\n\\nYou're going to kick out your foot.\\n\\nYou should feel your quadriceps contract\\n\\non the top of your thighs,\\n\\nand you're going to try and consciously contract them\\n\\nas hard as you can.\\n\\nTypically, if you want to point your toe\\n\\nback towards your knee or shin,\\n\\nthat's also going to help somewhat\\n\\nto contract even harder and harder.\\n\\nSo do that for about 10 seconds.\\n\\nA lot of you will do this just while standing,\\n\\ncontract, contract, contract.\\n\\nOkay, then release it.\\n\\nAnd then now go ahead and repeat that stretch\\n\\nwhere you're trying to touch your toes or touch the floor.\\n\\nSo this is again, relying more or less\\n\\non hamstring flexibility among other things.\\n\\nWhat most of you will find\\n\\nis that you have an immediate increase\\n\\nin hamstring flexibility\\n\\nor your range of motion has increased.\\n\\nIf you didn't experience that,\\n\\nthen I would encourage you to try\\n\\nand contract your quadriceps harder and longer.\\n\\nSo maybe 20 or 30 seconds,\\n\\nand then try this so-called experiment again.\\n\\nWhy would contracting your quadriceps\\n\\nallow your hamstring flexibility to suddenly increase?\\n\\nWell, the way that our muscles are organized\\n\\nis such that we have muscles\\n\\nthat are antagonistic to one another.\\n\\nSo our quadriceps and our hamstrings work\\n\\nin sort of a push-pull fashion, if you will.\\n\\nThey can antagonize one another.\\n\\nSo when you move your heel towards your glutes,\\n\\nyou are using your hamstring.\\n\\nThe hamstring obviously also does other things\\n\\nrelated to hip movement.\\n\\nAnd when you lift your knee\\n\\nor when you extend your foot and contract your quadriceps,\\n\\nyou are essentially relaxing the hamstrings.\\n\\nNow, of course, most movements involve\\n\\nboth the quadricep and hamstring in synchrony.\\n\\nAnd that synchrony is really an elegant one.\\n\\nBut here we're more or less isolating the quadriceps\\n\\nfrom the hamstrings,\\n\\nat least to the extent that it can leverage\\n\\nthese spindle stretch mechanisms.\\n\\nSo what happens is when you contract your quadriceps hard,\\n\\nyou are relaxing or releasing\\n\\nsome of the stretch that's occurring\\n\\nin those intrafusal spindle sensory fibers\\n\\ngoing into your spinal cord.\\n\\nAnd as a consequence,\\n\\nyou're able then to stretch your hamstrings further,\\n\\nor we can be more accurate and say that your range of motion\\n\\nabout the hamstring and its related joints is greater\\n\\nwhen you aren't engaging that spindle reflex,\\n\\nwhich would cause the hamstrings to contract.\\n\\nOkay, so if you are somebody who has tight hamstrings,\\n\\nthere could be a variety of reasons for that.\\n\\nBut part of the reason is likely to be neural,\\n\\nand you can release that neural spindle reflex\\n\\nby contracting the opposite antagonistic muscle,\\n\\nwhich in this case is the quadriceps.\\n\\nThe same thing is true and can be leveraged\\n\\nfor stretching other muscles.\\n\\nSo for instance, if you're going to do a tricep stretch,\\n\\nthe typical kind of overhead where you grab your elbow\\n\\nand move it toward the midline of your body\\n\\nwith the other hand, using your opposite hand,\\n\\nwell, you can do that.\\n\\nAnd then I would suggest trying to flex your bicep,\\n\\ncontract your bicep, that is, while doing that.\\n\\nAnd for most people, you'll notice a increase\\n\\nin the tricep range of motion or ability\\n\\nto kind of lean into or to relax into\\n\\nor to push that stretch a little bit further.\\n\\nNow, for you physios out there and for those of you\\n\\nthat have backgrounds in kinesiology,\\n\\nI want to acknowledge, of course,\\n\\nthere are other mechanisms that are coming into play.\\n\\nThere are actually neural connections\\n\\nwithin the joints themselves that are providing\\n\\nproprioceptive feedback, et cetera, et cetera.\\n\\nBut this is simply to illustrate that part of our range\\n\\nof motion is determined by the spindle mechanisms\\n\\nthat I spent some time focusing on earlier.\\n\\nAnd indeed, this approach can be leveraged\\n\\ntoward creating increased limb range of motion,\\n\\nnot just for the hamstrings, but for your quadriceps.\\n\\nSo for instance, if you have tight quadriceps,\\n\\nyou can do the opposite.\\n\\nYou can contract your hamstring very intensely\\n\\nfor let's say 10 seconds or 20 seconds or 30 seconds.\\n\\nSo that would take some conscious effort\\n\\nof bringing your heel up towards your glutes.\\n\\nYou could do that in a way that you're really trying\\n\\nto contract those muscles hard.\\n\\nYou'd have to use some deliberate hamstring activation\\n\\nthere, meaning you have to use those upper motor neurons\\n\\nand the other aspects of your upper brain power,\\n\\nas it were, to try and really contract your hamstrings\\n\\nas intensely as possible.\\n\\nThen you would relax that,\\n\\nand then you would do your quadriceps stretch again.\\n\\nAnd if you did a pre hamstring contraction measurement\\n\\nof your quadricep flexibility,\\n\\nand then you did a post hamstring contraction measure\\n\\nof your quadricep flexibility,\\n\\nalmost certainly you would find\\n\\nthat that flexibility had increased.\\n\\nNow, of course, the muscle really didn't change much.\\n\\nThe tendons didn't change much.\\n\\nWhat changed was the patterns of neural activation\\n\\nthat were restricting you from, in the first case,\\n\\nstretching your hamstring, or having a,\\n\\nto be more accurate, we should say,\\n\\nto having a certain range of motion about the hamstring\\n\\nand its related joints.\\n\\nAnd those break mechanisms were removed.\\n\\nAnd of course, then when you contract your hamstring,\\n\\nyou're removing some of the neural breaks,\\n\\nthe spindle acting as a break,\\n\\nand inhibiting that quadricep range of motion.\\n\\nOkay, so you can imagine this,\\n\\nand in fact, you can apply this\\n\\nfor any number of different muscles.\\n\\nThe larger muscles and the sort of biceps, triceps,\\n\\nand hamstrings, quadriceps are sort of the simplest place\\n\\nto think about this and to apply it.\\n\\nBut in theory, and indeed in practice,\\n\\nit really works for all the various muscle groups.\\n\\nIt's just sometimes harder to access\\n\\nthese so-called antagonistic muscle groups.\\n\\nNow, we should take a moment and just discuss\\n\\nwhat actually happens as we get more flexible\\n\\nin the short-term and long-term.\\n\\nI just mentioned what happens in the short-term.\\n\\nClearly, those don't involve lengthening of the muscles.\\n\\nIt's not like the muscles slide along the bones\\n\\nor that the tendons really stretch out that much\\n\\nmore than they had prior to that kind of exercise.\\n\\nBut it is the case that if people stretch consistently\\n\\nover a given period of several weeks or more,\\n\\nthat there are changes in the muscles.\\n\\nThis gets a little bit tricky in terms of nomenclature,\\n\\nand I just want to highlight that\\n\\nbecause I think that a number of people get frustrated\\n\\nand confused, in fact,\\n\\nwhen we talk about muscles getting longer.\\n\\nThe whole concept of a muscle getting longer\\n\\nisn't really in keeping with reality,\\n\\nbut there are elements within the muscles\\n\\nthat can change their conformation.\\n\\nSo to get a little bit detailed here,\\n\\nand we won't spend too much time on this,\\n\\nbut I just want to acknowledge this\\n\\nfor those of you that are interested\\n\\nin neuromuscular physiology\\n\\nand how it relates to flexibility.\\n\\nYou have your muscle fibers,\\n\\nand then you have your so-called myofibrils.\\n\\nSo you can imagine kind of a single fiber.\\n\\nThat fiber, of course, will get input\\n\\nfrom those motor neurons.\\n\\nAnd then within those fibers,\\n\\nyou have what are called sarcomeres.\\n\\nAnd you can kind of think about sarcomeres\\n\\nas little segments, kind of like the segments of bamboo.\\n\\nIf you ever look at bamboo, it's not just one big stalk.\\n\\nIt's got those little out pouchings along the way\\n\\nthat kind of break up what would be just one big stalk\\n\\nof bamboo into different segments.\\n\\nBut they're all connected.\\n\\nThe sarcomeres are somewhat like that.\\n\\nAnd within the sarcomeres,\\n\\nyou have a couple of different components.\\n\\nOne thing is called myosin, which is like a thick layer,\\n\\nand then the other is actin.\\n\\nAnd those are interdigitated, as we say.\\n\\nThey're kind of connected to one another,\\n\\nkind of like if you were to put your fingers together\\n\\nfrom your two hands,\\n\\nif you were going to put your fingers\\n\\nin between one another, that's interdigitated,\\n\\nliterally interdigitated in this case, so pun intended.\\n\\nAnd that myosin and actin kind of move relative\\n\\nto one another, and they have a lot to do\\n\\nwith your ability to contract muscles.\\n\\nWhen we stretch muscles,\\n\\nwhen we go through a stretching practice,\\n\\nthere are a number of things that change,\\n\\nsome neural, some related directly to connective tissue,\\n\\nbut also it appears from really nice work,\\n\\nmainly done from McGill University.\\n\\nI'll provide a link to a couple of these studies\\n\\nif you want to dig in there more deeply,\\n\\nthat change the confirmation,\\n\\nthe relative size and spacing of some of these things\\n\\nlike sarcomeres and the way that myosin and actin\\n\\nkind of work together.\\n\\nBut we don't want to think of muscles as lengthening.\\n\\nWe can, however, think about the resting state\\n\\nof a muscle being slightly different,\\n\\nor indeed very different,\\n\\nthan the resting state of a muscle of somebody\\n\\nor of a limb that has not undergone\\n\\nregular flexibility training.\\n\\nSo that's as much time as I want to spend on that,\\n\\nbecause we could spend an entire hour\\n\\ngetting right down into the details.\\n\\nBut I do want to emphasize, however,\\n\\nthat muscles have different parts.\\n\\nThey have fibers, they have sarcomeres,\\n\\nthey have myosin, they have actin.\\n\\nBut the idea of making our muscles longer,\\n\\nthat reflects a number of processes\\n\\nthat occur basically within an existing muscle length.\\n\\nThe length of our muscle bellies\\n\\nand where our insertions are\\n\\nrelative to our connective tissue in our limbs\\n\\nis genetically determined, right?\\n\\nSome people have, for instance, a bicep\\n\\nthat goes all the way from the crook of their elbow\\n\\nup to their shoulder, right?\\n\\nAnd some people can, you know,\\n\\nif they were to put their arm at a 90 degree angle,\\n\\ncould put two or three fingers\\n\\nbetween their bicep and their elbow.\\n\\nThey have a, we can say, a shorter bicep,\\n\\nrelatively shorter.\\n\\nNow, the reason I mention\\n\\nthese highly detailed cellular mechanisms\\n\\nis because as we start to embark on different protocols\\n\\nfor using stretching to increase flexibility\\n\\nand range of motion, we need to ask ourselves,\\n\\nwhat is preventing our ability to extend range of motion?\\n\\nIs it the spindle, right?\\n\\nIs it because the muscle is stretching too much?\\n\\nOftentimes it can be because of that\\n\\nand or because of a sense of pain\\n\\nor simply a sense that the muscle is not in a position\\n\\nthat it's been in before,\\n\\nthat's unrelated to pain or to spindle activation.\\n\\nAnd oftentimes it can be related directly\\n\\nto these changes in the confirmation of myosin and actin\\n\\nand within the context of the sarcomeres.\\n\\nNow, of course, you can't peer into\\n\\nor sense your individual sarcomeres.\\n\\nHowever, you do have neurons that innervate these areas\\n\\nand that send that sensory information\\n\\nback into the spinal cord and up to your brain to interpret.\\n\\nSo you'll find that as we move along,\\n\\nthere are specific adjustments that you can make\\n\\nat both the macro level,\\n\\nmeaning how much movement to insert into your stretching,\\n\\nright, is it going to be a static or dynamic\\n\\nor even a ballistic stretch?\\n\\nOr for instance, at the micro level,\\n\\nthat even just a slight sub-millimeter or millimeter increase\\n\\nin the stretching of a given muscle and it related tissues\\n\\ncan translate into an increased range of motion performance.\\n\\nAs a quick but relevant aside,\\n\\nI thought I'd share with you something useful\\n\\nthat's also grounded in this notion of antagonistic muscles.\\n\\nSo for those of you that do resistance training,\\n\\nwhether or not it's with body weight\\n\\nor with physical weights or machines, what have you,\\n\\nyou may have found that if you,\\n\\nlet's say we're to do three sets of a pushing exercise.\\n\\nSo this could be push-ups, this could be bench presses,\\n\\nthis could be shoulder presses, something of that sort.\\n\\nAnd then later in the workout, you were to do,\\n\\nlet's say machine pull-downs or pull-ups\\n\\nor chin-ups of some sort, so a pulling exercise.\\n\\nTypically what you would find is if you were to do\\n\\nwhat's often called straight sets,\\n\\nso you would do three sets of push-ups,\\n\\nlet's say with two minutes of rest in between,\\n\\nthat you might be able to get a certain number\\n\\nof repetitions on the first set.\\n\\nJust for sake of example, let's say you can get\\n\\n10 repetitions on the first set\\n\\nand then you get eight repetitions on the second set\\n\\nand then you get six repetitions on the third set\\n\\nwith two minutes in between.\\n\\nAnd then you would move on at some point\\n\\nto your pulling exercises and similarly,\\n\\nlet's say you were doing chin-ups or pull-downs\\n\\nand you would get 10 repetitions, rest two minutes,\\n\\neight repetitions, rest two minutes and six repetitions.\\n\\nOkay, fine.\\n\\nWell, typically what people discover\\n\\nis that if they interleave their pushing\\n\\nand pulling exercises, provided they do that\\n\\nfor muscles that are antagonistic to one another.\\n\\nSo in this case, pushing with the chest, shoulders\\n\\nand triceps for the pushing exercises\\n\\nand pulling with the back and biceps\\n\\nand of course there are other muscles involved as well.\\n\\nBut because those muscle groups are at least in part\\n\\nantagonistic to one another, what people often find\\n\\nis that if they were to say, do their pushing set,\\n\\nget 10 repetitions, then move to a pulling set\\n\\nafter just say 60 seconds and perform that pulling set,\\n\\nthen go back to the pushing set,\\n\\nthen go back to a pulling set, push, pull, push, pull.\\n\\nIn other words, interleaving their sets,\\n\\neven if they were to maintain the same amount of rest\\n\\nbetween sets of pushing and sets of pulling,\\n\\nwhat they discover often is that the drop in the number\\n\\nof repetitions that they get is somewhat offset.\\n\\nSo rather than get 10, eight, six,\\n\\nas it were with the straight sets, it will be 10, nine, eight.\\n\\nSo what this means is not that you're increasing\\n\\nthe total rest time to four minutes between sets\\n\\nbecause then of course it wouldn't be equivalent,\\n\\nbut rather that while maintaining the same amount of rest\\n\\nbetween sets for this same muscle group,\\n\\nby going from push, pull, push, pull of antagonistic muscles,\\n\\nyou're able to have improved performance.\\n\\nAnd the reason for that has everything to do\\n\\nwith what we were describing before,\\n\\nwhich is that typically if you were to do push, set, rest,\\n\\npush, set, rest, push, set, rest, well,\\n\\nin between those sets and in fact,\\n\\nactually during those sets of pushing,\\n\\nthe pulling muscles that would be involved\\n\\nin the chin ups or pull downs, et cetera,\\n\\nare actually relaxing or at least are being released\\n\\nof some tension, including the activation\\n\\nof the spindles among other things.\\n\\nSo that's a long-winded way of saying\\n\\nthe interleaving push and pull of antagonistic sets\\n\\ncan leverage some of the same neural circuits\\n\\nthat we're talking about leveraging\\n\\nfor sake of increasing flexibility.\\n\\nNow, I offer this to you as a tool that you can try.\\n\\nOne of the challenges with using this tool, however,\\n\\nis that you often have to occupy multiple sites\\n\\nwithin the gym.\\n\\nIf you're doing this at home and you have your own gym,\\n\\nthat's one thing.\\n\\nIf you're doing this in a gym where you have\\n\\nmultiple pieces of equipment,\\n\\nwell, then you become that person who has essentially\\n\\ntaken over some small corner or multiple corners\\n\\nor machines within the gym.\\n\\nAnd oftentimes you'll find that you'll walk back\\n\\nto a machine or you'll walk back\\n\\nto a given resistance exercise\\n\\nand someone has now taken it over\\n\\nand the whole thing can be thrown off.\\n\\nSo it takes a little bit of orchestrating\\n\\nin order to do properly, but in general,\\n\\nwhat people find is that this can allow you\\n\\nto enhance performance overall\\n\\nof these individual movements, again,\\n\\nwhile maintaining the same amount of rest.\\n\\nAnd even if you choose not to do this,\\n\\nI encourage you to pay attention to this as a concept\\n\\nbecause again, it's leveraging this idea\\n\\nof antagonistic muscles, flexors and extensors,\\n\\nantagonistic neural relationships\\n\\nbetween the spinal cord mechanisms\\n\\nthat control one set of muscles\\n\\nand activating those muscles,\\n\\nallowing the opposite antagonistic muscle to relax\\n\\nand therefore to perform better on its next set.\\n\\nSo now I'd like to shift to the question of\\n\\nwhat types of stretching can and should we do\\n\\nto increase limb range of motion?\\n\\nIf our goal is to do that in the most efficient way possible\\n\\nbecause I realized that most people don't have\\n\\nendless amounts of time to dedicate to a stretching practice\\n\\nand even for those of us that do,\\n\\nI'm sure that you want to get the most outcome\\n\\nfor a given effort.\\n\\nAnd what are the modes of stretching\\n\\nthat are going to allow us to increase our flexibility\\n\\nand limb range of motion most safely?\\n\\nNow, there are a number of different types of stretching\\n\\nor methods of stretching.\\n\\nBroadly defined, we can describe these as dynamic,\\n\\nballistic, static, and what's called PNF stretching.\\n\\nPNF stands for proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation\\n\\nand it involves and leverages many of the mechanisms\\n\\nthat I described to you earlier.\\n\\nThe first two that I mentioned,\\n\\ndynamic and ballistic stretching,\\n\\nboth involve some degree of momentum\\n\\nand can be distinguished from static\\n\\nand PNF type stretching.\\n\\nNow, to distinguish dynamic stretching\\n\\nfrom ballistic stretching,\\n\\nlike to focus on this element of momentum.\\n\\nBoth involve moving a limb through a given range of motion.\\n\\nIn dynamic stretching, however,\\n\\nit tends to be more controlled, less use of momentum,\\n\\nespecially towards the end range of motion.\\n\\nWhereas in ballistic stretching,\\n\\nthere tends to be a bit more swinging of the limb\\n\\nor use of momentum.\\n\\nSo I invite you to visualize\\n\\nwhat dynamic and ballistic stretching\\n\\nmight look like in your mind.\\n\\nYou can even try it if it's safe for you to try it.\\n\\nYou could imagine swinging your arm up overhead\\n\\nas much as possible and bringing it down.\\n\\nI'm doing this because I'm seated.\\n\\nIt's kind of ridiculous movement to do while seated\\n\\nor perhaps at all.\\n\\nBut for instance, you can see dynamic\\n\\nand ballistic stretching anytime someone, for instance,\\n\\nis holding onto something with one arm\\n\\nor maybe not holding on and swinging out their foot.\\n\\nSo essentially getting movement about the hip joint.\\n\\nAnd you'll notice that some people raise it up\\n\\nand pause it and bring it down.\\n\\nThat's one form of dynamic stretching.\\n\\nWhereas others will swing it up\\n\\nand sort of let it carry itself a bit further,\\n\\ndo the momentum at the top of the movement\\n\\nand then just let it drop back down\\n\\nor maybe even control the descent.\\n\\nThere is an enormous range of parameter space here\\n\\nor variables that one could imagine.\\n\\nAnd there's just simply no way\\n\\nthat we could subdivide all those.\\n\\nBut again, dynamic and ballistic stretching\\n\\nboth involve movement.\\n\\nSo we have to generate some force\\n\\nin order to create that movement.\\n\\nBallistic stretching involving a bit more momentum\\n\\nor sometimes a lot more momentum,\\n\\nespecially at the end range of motion.\\n\\nNow, both of those are highly distinct\\n\\nfrom static stretching,\\n\\nwhich involves holding the end range of motion.\\n\\nSo minimizing the amount of momentum that's used.\\n\\nSo to stay with a simple example\\n\\nthat we are all now familiar with\\n\\nfrom our earlier discussion,\\n\\nslowly bending over at the waist\\n\\nand trying to touch your toes\\n\\nor putting your hands to the floor\\n\\nand then holding that end position\\n\\nbefore coming up in a slow and controlled way\\n\\nsuch that you reduce the amount of momentum to near zero\\n\\nwould be one example of static stretching.\\n\\nStatic stretching can be further subdivided\\n\\ninto active or passive, right?\\n\\nThere are different names for these kinds of approaches.\\n\\nYou can hear about the Anderson approach\\n\\nor the Janda approach.\\n\\nYou can look these sorts of things up online.\\n\\nAnd again, people tend to name things after themselves.\\n\\nSo some of these are proprietary related\\n\\nto specific programs.\\n\\nI'm not focusing on those.\\n\\nOthers come to be named after the physiologists\\n\\nor the practitioners that initially popularize them.\\n\\nAs is always the case,\\n\\nthere's always a naming and renaming\\n\\nand claiming of territory with these things.\\n\\nFor the time being, I'd like to just emphasize\\n\\nthat static stretching can be both active\\n\\nwhere there's a dedicated effort\\n\\non the part of the stretcher, you,\\n\\nto put force behind the hold to kind of extend\\n\\nor literally to extend the range of motion.\\n\\nAnd then there's also passive static stretching\\n\\nin which it's more of a relaxation\\n\\ninto a further range of motion.\\n\\nAnd that can be a subtle distinction.\\n\\nAnd there are other ways in which we can further\\n\\ndistinguish active and passive static stretching.\\n\\nBut nonetheless, static stretching involves\\n\\nboth those types of elements, active and passive,\\n\\nbut is really about eliminating momentum.\\n\\nAnd then there's the PNF,\\n\\nthe proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation.\\n\\nAnd proprioception has several different meanings\\n\\nin the context of neuroscience and physiology\\n\\nto just keep it really simple for today.\\n\\nProprioception involves both a knowledge and understanding\\n\\nof where our limbs are in space and relative to our body,\\n\\ntypically relative to the midline.\\n\\nSo the brain is often trying to figure out\\n\\nwhere are our limbs relative to our midline\\n\\ndown the center of our body.\\n\\nAnd we know where our limbs are\\n\\nbased on so-called proprioceptive feedback.\\n\\nSo that's feedback that comes from sensory neurons, right?\\n\\nNow you know what sensory neurons\\n\\nthat are essentially monitoring or responding to events\\n\\nwithin the joints, the connective tissue and the muscles,\\n\\nand within the deep components of the muscles,\\n\\nlike the spindle reflex and within the tendons\\n\\nlike the GTO, the Golgi tendon organ.\\n\\nSo PNF type stretching leverages these sorts of mechanisms,\\n\\nthese neural circuits by way of, for instance,\\n\\nyou would lie on your back.\\n\\nAnd if your goal is to increase your hamstring flexibility\\n\\nand the flexibility and range of motion\\n\\nof other related muscle systems,\\n\\nyou might put a strap around your ankle\\n\\nand pull that muscle, or I should say, excuse me,\\n\\nthat limb towards you.\\n\\nYou're not going to pull the muscle towards you.\\n\\nYou're going to pull that limb, your ankle,\\n\\ntowards you to try and get it sort of back over your head\\n\\nand then progressively relaxing into that,\\n\\nor maybe even putting some additional force\\n\\nto push the end range of motion and then relaxing it,\\n\\nand then actually trying to stretch that same limb\\n\\nor increase the limb range of motion without the strap,\\n\\nright?\\n\\nSometimes these are assisted by other people.\\n\\nSo people will even use loads.\\n\\nSometimes they'll even use machines.\\n\\nThere are a number of different apparatus\\n\\nthat have been designed for this.\\n\\nSometimes it'll involve a training partner.\\n\\nThere's a huge range of PNF protocols\\n\\nand those protocols can be done both by oneself\\n\\nwith or without straps, with machines,\\n\\nwith actual weights or with training partners.\\n\\nIf you're interested in the variation of exercises\\n\\nto say target your hamstrings versus your quadriceps\\n\\nversus your shoulders versus your chest muscles, et cetera,\\n\\nyour neck muscles and so on,\\n\\nthere is an enormous range of information\\n\\non dynamic, ballistic, static, and PNF stretches\\n\\nfor all the various muscle groups.\\n\\nAnd I should say there are some excellent books\\n\\non those topics.\\n\\nThere are also some excellent videos on YouTube\\n\\nand elsewhere.\\n\\nNowadays, it's pretty easy to find exercises\\n\\nthat allow you to target specific muscle groups\\n\\nand I encourage you to be safe in how you approach this\\n\\nand I would encourage you also to pay attention\\n\\nto the information that soon follows\\n\\nas to what sorts of protocols one would use\\n\\nto apply those exercises.\\n\\nBut the number of exercises and the availability\\n\\nof those exercises for targeting different muscle groups\\n\\nwith these four different kinds of stretching\\n\\nis both immense and fortunately, thankfully,\\n\\nimmediately accessible to all of us, often at zero cost.\\n\\nSo specific exercises to target specific muscle groups aside,\\n\\nwe've now established that there are four major categories\\n\\nof stretching or at least those are the four major categories\\n\\nI'm defining today.\\n\\nAnd we can further divide those categories\\n\\ninto which are the ones that are going to be most effective\\n\\nfor increasing range of motion in the long-term,\\n\\nnot just in one individual session.\\n\\nAnd there've been a number of studies exploring this.\\n\\nI can list out at least four and we'll put those four\\n\\nas a kind of a cluster under one heading\\n\\nin the show note captions\\n\\nthat arrive at essentially the same answer,\\n\\nwhich is that for increasing limb range of motion,\\n\\nit does appear that static type, including PNF,\\n\\nbut static type stretching is going to be more effective\\n\\nthan dynamic and ballistic stretching.\\n\\nSo at least to my mind, this is good news.\\n\\nWhy is it good news to me?\\n\\nWell, while dynamic and ballistic stretching\\n\\ncan be immensely useful for improving performance\\n\\nof specific movements,\\n\\nin particular in the context of particular sports\\n\\nlike tennis or in sprinting or frankly for any sport,\\n\\nthey do carry with them a certain amount of risk\\n\\nbecause of the use of momentum.\\n\\nSo you don't need to be highly trained\\n\\nin order to perform them.\\n\\nIn fact, there is a place and we will describe\\n\\nwhen one would want to apply dynamic or ballistic stretching.\\n\\nI'll just give away for now.\\n\\nI think that most physios out there\\n\\nand certainly the ones that I spoke to,\\n\\nDr. Andy Galpin, Dr. Kelly Starrett and a few others\\n\\npoint to the fact that doing some safe dynamic\\n\\nand ballistic stretching prior to say\\n\\na resistance training session\\n\\nor maybe even prior to a cardiovascular training session\\n\\ncan be useful, both in terms of range of motion effects\\n\\nand in terms of neural activation effects.\\n\\nI don't want to use the words warm up\\n\\nbecause warming up is typically associated\\n\\nwith increasing core body temperature as it should be,\\n\\nbut for engaging the neural circuits\\n\\nand becoming familiarized with the neural circuits\\n\\nthat you're about to use in other movements\\n\\nwhile also increasing the range of motion\\n\\nof the joints involved in those movements\\n\\nso that you can perform them more safely\\n\\nand more confidently.\\n\\nSo I'm certainly not saying, I want to repeat,\\n\\nI'm certainly not saying that dynamic\\n\\nand ballistic stretching are not useful.\\n\\nThey absolutely are.\\n\\nBut in terms of increasing limb range of motion\\n\\nin the longterm of truly becoming more flexible\\n\\nas opposed to transiently more flexible,\\n\\nstatic stretching, which includes PNF\\n\\nappears to be the best route to go.\\n\\nSo if your goal is to increase your limb range of motion\\n\\nfor a given muscle group or perhaps for all muscle groups,\\n\\nalthough you can imagine that'd be pretty tough.\\n\\nI mean, you're not going to spend time,\\n\\nI could imagine working on your tongue muscle control\\n\\nor neck muscle control and every muscle control,\\n\\nbut most of us want to reduce so-called tightness\\n\\nin air quotes and increase limb range of motion\\n\\nfor certain muscle groups.\\n\\nAnd it appears that the best way to do that\\n\\nis going to be static stretching of some kind,\\n\\nwhich raises the question of how often\\n\\nto do that static stretching\\n\\nand how long to hold those static stretches.\\n\\nAnd we can also ask the question,\\n\\nwe should ask the question,\\n\\nwhere to hold those static stretches?\\n\\nIs it always a good idea to hold those static stretches\\n\\nat the end or the point of maximal range of motion?\\n\\nWe're going to address that now.\\n\\nThere's some terrific science around this.\\n\\nA slightly older study, but nonetheless, a powerful one,\\n\\nbecause it provided a foundation\\n\\nfor a lot of subsequent work,\\n\\nwhich basically served to just confirm\\n\\nthe answer they got here, is a study from Bandy et al.\\n\\nAnd the title of this study is the effect of time\\n\\nand frequency of static stretching\\n\\non the flexibility of the hamstring muscles.\\n\\nIt was a study involving 93 subjects.\\n\\nSo 61 men, 32 women, ranging in age from 21 to 39 years.\\n\\nSo a pretty broad demographic\\n\\nwho had limited hamstring muscle flexibility,\\n\\nhere I'm paraphrasing,\\n\\nand randomly assigned to one of five groups.\\n\\nSo the four stretching groups stretched five days per week\\n\\nfor six weeks.\\n\\nThe fifth group, which served as a control,\\n\\ndid not stretch.\\n\\nThe results clearly show that, quote,\\n\\nthe change in flexibility appeared to be dependent\\n\\non the duration and frequency of stretching.\\n\\nThis is great.\\n\\nThis tells us that stretching for a given amount of time\\n\\nscales with the amount of limb range of motion improvement\\n\\nthat one will see.\\n\\nThere were many interesting findings within this study,\\n\\nbut the one that I'd like to highlight most is, quote,\\n\\nthe results of this study suggest\\n\\nthat a 30-second duration is an effective amount of time\\n\\nto sustain a hamstring muscle stretch\\n\\nin order to increase range of motion.\\n\\nNo increase in flexibility occurred\\n\\nwhen the duration of stretching was increased\\n\\nfrom 30 seconds to 60 seconds,\\n\\nor when the frequency of stretching was increased\\n\\nfrom one to three times per day.\\n\\nOkay, so now we're starting to lay down some parameters.\\n\\nWhat this study reveals and what subsequent studies tell us,\\n\\nand we will get into those subsequent studies,\\n\\nis that ideally one would do static stretches\\n\\nthat are held for 30 seconds,\\n\\nperhaps more in certain instances,\\n\\nand I'll explain when that can be useful,\\n\\nbut here, holding those stretches for more than 30 seconds\\n\\ndid not turn out to be additionally useful.\\n\\nSo if you're going to stretch your quadricep, for instance,\\n\\nand you're going to hold that stretch in static fashion,\\n\\nremember, not using momentum,\\n\\nand you can use the mental tricks\\n\\nof either trying to push through the pain,\\n\\nwhich I don't recommend necessarily.\\n\\nI think that makes us prone to injury,\\n\\nor to relax into the stretch,\\n\\nbut nonetheless, providing some force,\\n\\ntypically with a hand in order to pull your ankle back.\\n\\nIf you're doing a quadricep stretch,\\n\\nsome people might do this on the edge of a sofa.\\n\\nRemember, there are a lot of different exercises\\n\\nand ways to do this that you can explore elsewhere.\\n\\nWell, holding that static stretch for 30 seconds\\n\\nappears to be sufficient to stimulate an increase\\n\\nin limb range of motion over time.\\n\\nAgain, these are protocols\\n\\nthat were used repeatedly over time,\\n\\nand we'll talk about how often to repeat them\\n\\nin order to get maximal effect.\\n\\nBut 30 second holds for static stretches\\n\\nis the number that I think we want to focus on,\\n\\nand that most of us are going to want to utilize.\\n\\nSo now let's explore how many sets of static stretching\\n\\none ought to do in order to get\\n\\na maximum range of motion improvement\\n\\nwhile not placing us into a system\\n\\nthat's going to create injury,\\n\\nnor a situation where we have to be\\n\\nconstantly stretching throughout the day,\\n\\nbecause again, most of us don't have time to do that.\\n\\nThis issue of sets is an important one.\\n\\nIn the context of cardiovascular exercise,\\n\\nwe've talked about the data that support the fact\\n\\nthat doing at least 150,\\n\\nand ideally as much as 200 minutes per week\\n\\nof zone two cardiovascular exercise\\n\\nis very useful for cardiovascular health\\n\\nand for other aspects of health.\\n\\nAnd of course, there are other aspects\\n\\nof cardiovascular exercise that can be layered onto\\n\\nand into that that can be useful,\\n\\nlike 90 second maximal sprints, et cetera.\\n\\nDiscussed this a lot in the episode with Dr. Andy Galpin\\n\\nand on our episode about endurance.\\n\\nAnd we also talked about sets in the context\\n\\nof strength and hypertrophy building,\\n\\nbuilding muscle size and or strength\\n\\nin the episode about that,\\n\\nand in particular in the episode with Dr. Andy Galpin.\\n\\nAnd there we could also arrive at some specific parameters\\n\\nand it's going to vary, of course, between individuals,\\n\\ndepending on how hard you train,\\n\\nwhether or not you take sets to failure,\\n\\nyour repetition range, et cetera.\\n\\nBut in the context of strength and hypertrophy building,\\n\\nwe arrived at a approximately six,\\n\\nmaybe as many as 10 sets per week per muscle group.\\n\\nSome of that work is done as direct work\\n\\nto a given muscle group.\\n\\nSome of that work is indirect.\\n\\nSo doing certain pulling exercise, of course,\\n\\nwill target the latissimus dorsi muscles,\\n\\nbut also the biceps.\\n\\nSo if you, that doesn't necessarily mean\\n\\nyou have to do 10 sets for the biceps and for the lats.\\n\\nSometimes you're getting some indirect work, et cetera.\\n\\nAll of that was delineated in the episode\\n\\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin.\\n\\nAnd we arrived at those numbers of sets\\n\\naccording to the same criteria that we will apply here.\\n\\nWhat is the minimum number of sets both to maintain\\n\\nand to improve a given mode of performance?\\n\\nStrength and hypertrophy or cardiovascular health.\\n\\nAgain, to either maintain or improve.\\n\\nAnd we can do the same thing for improving\\n\\nor maintaining range of motion.\\n\\nBecause as I mentioned earlier,\\n\\nthe data point to the fact that if we don't do\\n\\nsome dedicated work to improve range of motion over time,\\n\\nwe will lose our flexibility\\n\\nand limb range of motion over time.\\n\\nJust by virtue of the fact that we're not doing anything\\n\\nto offset that.\\n\\nSo whether or not you want to maintain,\\n\\nreestablish or gain limb range of motion,\\n\\nstatic stretching of holds of 30 seconds appear to be best.\\n\\nNow the question is, how long should you do that?\\n\\nAnd how many sets should you do that?\\n\\nAnd how many times a week should you do that?\\n\\nTo answer those questions,\\n\\nI'm going to turn to what I think\\n\\nis a really spectacular review.\\n\\nThis was a review that was published in the year 2018.\\n\\nSo it's fairly recent.\\n\\nFirst author, Thomas Erwin Thomas, last author, Palma.\\n\\nWe will put a link to this in the show note caption.\\n\\nThe title of the paper is the relation\\n\\nbetween stretching typology and stretching duration,\\n\\nthe effects on range of motion.\\n\\nIt's a very straightforward title.\\n\\nThis is a review article\\n\\nthat explored a number of different studies.\\n\\nHad criteria for whether or not those studies\\n\\ncould be evaluated in the context of the questions here,\\n\\nhad some quality standards\\n\\nand some other standards that they applied.\\n\\nAnd basically,\\n\\nwindowed down a large collection of studies\\n\\nto a remaining 23 articles that were able to be considered\\n\\nquote, eligible and included\\n\\nin the quantitative synthesis done here.\\n\\nSo key points from that quantification\\n\\nand synthesis done in this paper.\\n\\nFirst of all, and I quote,\\n\\nall stretching typologies showed\\n\\nrange of motion improvements over a long-term period.\\n\\nHowever, the static protocols showed significant gains\\n\\nwith a P value less than 0.05,\\n\\nwhich means a probability that cannot be explained\\n\\nby chance alone when compared to ballistic or PNF protocols.\\n\\nSo again, what we're hearing is that static stretching\\n\\nis the preferred mode for increasing limb range of motion.\\n\\nAlthough here they make the additional point\\n\\nthat static stretching might even be superior,\\n\\nnot just to ballistic stretching,\\n\\nbut also to PNF protocols.\\n\\nBecause before, as you may recall,\\n\\nthere was a distinction between ballistic and dynamic\\n\\nand static and PNF.\\n\\nAnd so here it appears again that static stretching\\n\\nis sort of rising to the top of the list\\n\\nas the optimal approach relative\\n\\nto all other stretching approaches,\\n\\nat least in the context of increasing limb range of motion.\\n\\nThe authors go on to say,\\n\\ntime spent stretching per week seems fundamental\\n\\nto elicit range of movement improvements\\n\\nwhen stretches are applied for at least\\n\\nor more than five minutes per week.\\n\\nOkay, this is critical.\\n\\nThis is not five minutes per stretch.\\n\\nRemember, 30 seconds per static stretch,\\n\\nbut at least five minutes per week.\\n\\nWhereas the time spent stretching within a single session\\n\\ndoes not seem to have a significant effects\\n\\nfor range of motion gains.\\n\\nIf this is getting confusing,\\n\\nI'll make sure that you soon understand\\n\\nexactly what we can export from these conclusions.\\n\\nThe data indicate that performing stretching\\n\\nat least five days a week.\\n\\nNow, some of you may already be groaning\\n\\nfor at least five minutes per week.\\n\\nOkay, so five days per week, that's a lot,\\n\\nbut at least five minutes per week,\\n\\nfive minutes per week is not that much.\\n\\nUsing static stretching may be beneficial\\n\\nto promote range of motion improvements.\\n\\nOkay, I've read this study in detail now.\\n\\nThey highlight, again, the reduction in flexibility\\n\\nthat occurs from 20 to 49 years of age and so on,\\n\\nhow acute bouts of short-term stretching\\n\\nup to three weeks can improve stretch tolerance.\\n\\nI think that's a key point that in the short term,\\n\\nthe first three weeks of embarking\\n\\non a stretching and flexibility program,\\n\\nmuch of the improvements come\\n\\nfrom the short-term neural improvements\\n\\nthat we talked about before\\n\\nof inhibiting the spindle reflex and so on,\\n\\nand also a stretch tolerance,\\n\\na comfort with doing the movements,\\n\\nand maybe even a comfort in overriding\\n\\nsome of the pain mechanisms.\\n\\nI'll talk a little bit more about that in just a bit,\\n\\nand the particular utility of yoga,\\n\\nsomething that I don't often practice,\\n\\nbut that after reading this article\\n\\nthat I'll mention in a little bit,\\n\\nI'm considering perhaps taking up\\n\\nsome form of yoga protocol.\\n\\nNow, I've already highlighted some\\n\\nof the key takeaways from the study,\\n\\nnamely that we need to get at least five minutes per week\\n\\nof static stretching per muscle group,\\n\\nand based on the previous paper that we talked about,\\n\\nwe need to divide that five minutes\\n\\ninto sets of 30 seconds each.\\n\\nAnd as I mentioned earlier,\\n\\nit doesn't seem to be the case\\n\\nthat you can do all of that in one day, unfortunately.\\n\\nIt does seem important that the frequency\\n\\nof stretching practice distributed\\n\\nthroughout the week is important.\\n\\nSo let's talk protocols.\\n\\nWe are now talking about doing static stretching,\\n\\nso holding, so limiting momentum,\\n\\nand holding a stretch for 30 seconds per set.\\n\\nWe're talking about trying to achieve five minutes per week\\n\\nof those static holds,\\n\\nbut that we can't do it all in one session\\n\\nbecause the frequency of sessions\\n\\ndistributed throughout the week correlates\\n\\nwith the improvements in limb range of motion.\\n\\nSo what this means is that we should probably be doing\\n\\nanywhere from two to four sets\\n\\nof 30 second static hold stretches five days a week,\\n\\nor some variant thereof.\\n\\nAnd I do say some variant thereof\\n\\nbecause it turns out that even though\\n\\nthere was that earlier study that we talked about,\\n\\nthat holding a stretch for more than 30 seconds,\\n\\nin that case, 60 seconds,\\n\\ndidn't turn out to be additionally beneficial.\\n\\nIt appears that if you do hold those stretches\\n\\nfor 60 seconds per static stretching set, for instance,\\n\\nyou can get away with stretching fewer days per week overall.\\n\\nSo in order to make this as clear as possible,\\n\\nbecause I do realize there are a lot of parameters,\\n\\nand you might be asking,\\n\\nwhy didn't you just make me a list\\n\\nof the exact things I should do?\\n\\nWell, it doesn't work that way\\n\\nbecause once you understand the mechanisms\\n\\nand once you understand your particular goals,\\n\\nthis information is designed for you to be able\\n\\nto construct a stretching program\\n\\nthat is tailored to your specific goals.\\n\\nIf I just gave you the stretching program that I'm doing,\\n\\nor I should say that I'm soon to be doing,\\n\\nbecause I'm soon to be doing one\\n\\nbased on the research for this particular episode,\\n\\nwell, that wouldn't be beneficial for you.\\n\\nBecause for instance, if you have very flexible hamstrings,\\n\\nbut not very flexible quadriceps,\\n\\nor you are somebody who is engaged in sport\\n\\nor not engaged in sport,\\n\\nwhat you need to do is going to vary somewhat.\\n\\nSo what would effective stretching protocol look like?\\n\\nWe're all trying to improve limb range of motion\\n\\nfor different limbs and different muscle groups.\\n\\nBut just by way of example,\\n\\nand that's because the one we've been using,\\n\\nlet's talk about hamstrings for the time being.\\n\\nThis could of course be applied to other muscle groups.\\n\\nLet's say you want to improve hamstring flexibility\\n\\nand limb range of motion about and around the hamstring\\n\\nand involving the hamstring.\\n\\nYou would want to do three sets\\n\\nof static stretching for the hamstring.\\n\\nAgain, easy to find such exercises on the internet.\\n\\nYou would do that by holding the stretch for 30 seconds,\\n\\nresting some period of time,\\n\\nthen doing it again, holding for 30 seconds,\\n\\nresting some period of time,\\n\\nand then holding it for 30 seconds.\\n\\nThat would be one training session for the hamstrings.\\n\\nI have to imagine that you'd probably want to stretch\\n\\nother muscle groups as well in that same session.\\n\\nAlthough at least as far as I could tell,\\n\\nthere were no data pointing to the fact\\n\\nthat you couldn't do your hamstring stretching\\n\\none part of the day\\n\\nand your quadriceps stretching another part of the day.\\n\\nBut presumably you're going to want to combine\\n\\nyour flexibility training into one single session.\\n\\nSo three sets of 30 seconds each get 90 seconds.\\n\\nAnd you would do that ideally five times a week\\n\\nor maybe even more,\\n\\nbecause it does seem like frequency distributed\\n\\nthroughout the week is an important parameter.\\n\\nNow, one thing that we have not highlighted\\n\\nor at least described is how long to rest\\n\\nbetween stretching sets.\\n\\nAnd despite my efforts,\\n\\nI could not find research back information\\n\\nthat pointed to whether or not 30 seconds of rest\\n\\nfor every 30 second stretching\\n\\nor 60 seconds rest for every 30 second stretching was ideal.\\n\\nI think it's reasonable to assume that doubling the amount\\n\\nof time for the interleaving rest would be appropriate\\n\\nor at least doable.\\n\\nIf anyone out there has knowledge about rest\\n\\nbetween stretching sets and has some physiology\\n\\nor some biology or some experiential information\\n\\nas to why a given ratio of duration of static stretch\\n\\nto rest in between static stretch sets ought to be used.\\n\\nPlease put it in the comments on YouTube.\\n\\nThat'd be a terrific way for us to get that information.\\n\\nI'd love to do any follow-up to links that you provide\\n\\nand so on.\\n\\nBut now we're starting to build into a protocol\\n\\nthat is backed by the scientific data.\\n\\nThree sets of 30 seconds of holds done five times\\n\\nor maybe even six times per week.\\n\\nOne thing that did show up in my exploration\\n\\nof the peer-reviewed research is this notion\\n\\nof warming up for all this.\\n\\nWe haven't talked about that yet.\\n\\nIn general, to avoid injury, it's a good idea\\n\\nto raise your core body temperature a bit\\n\\nbefore doing these kinds of stretches,\\n\\neven these static stretches, which we can sort of ease into\\n\\nand don't involve ballistic movement by definition.\\n\\nAnd the basic takeaway that I was able to find\\n\\nwas that if we are already warm from running\\n\\nor from weight training or from some other activity,\\n\\nthat doing the static stretching practice\\n\\nat the end of that weight training or cardiovascular\\n\\nor other physical session would allow us to go immediately\\n\\ninto the stretching session\\n\\nbecause we're already warm, so to speak.\\n\\nOtherwise raising one's core body temperature by a bit\\n\\nby doing five to seven, maybe even 10 minutes\\n\\nof easy cardiovascular exercise or calisthenic movements\\n\\nprovided you can do those without getting injured.\\n\\nSeems to be an ideal way to warm up the body\\n\\nfor stretching.\\n\\nWe should be warm or warm up to stretch,\\n\\nalthough those warmups don't have to be\\n\\nextremely extensive.\\n\\nAnd then just by way of logic, doing the static stretching\\n\\nafter resistance training or cardiovascular training\\n\\nseems to be most beneficial.\\n\\nIn fact, and unfortunately we don't have time to go\\n\\ninto this in too much detail today.\\n\\nI was able to find a number of papers\\n\\nthat make the argument that static stretching prior\\n\\nto cardiovascular training and maybe even prior\\n\\nto resistance training can limit our performance\\n\\nin running and resistance training.\\n\\nI realize that's a controversial area.\\n\\nYou have those who say, no, it's immensely beneficial.\\n\\nYou have those who say, no, it inhibits performance.\\n\\nAnd those that say, no, it's a matter of how exactly\\n\\nyou perform that static stretching and which muscle groups\\n\\nand how you're doing this and how much time\\n\\nin between static stretching and performance.\\n\\nBut to leave all that aside, doing static stretching\\n\\nafter some other form of exercise.\\n\\nAnd if not after some form of exercise,\\n\\nafter a brief warmup to raise your core body temperature,\\n\\ndefinitely seems like the right way to go.\\n\\nNow for some of you out there, and I confess for me as well,\\n\\ndoing something five days a week seems like a big commitment,\\n\\neven if that commitment is one to only do three sets\\n\\nof 30 second static stretches.\\n\\nI say this because you've got the warmup.\\n\\nI generally like to bring a kind of a focus\\n\\nand dedication to a practice.\\n\\nAnd of course, because when doing these kinds of protocols,\\n\\nit's likely that you're not just stretching your hamstrings.\\n\\nSo it's not just 90 seconds of work with a minute of rest\\n\\nin between, but very likely that we're also doing\\n\\nquadriceps stretching and also doing stretching\\n\\nfor the shoulders and stretching for the back\\n\\nand the neck and so on.\\n\\nAnd so that entire session is going to take some time.\\n\\nAnd five days a week is a pretty serious commitment\\n\\nfor most, especially for those of us that don't exercise\\n\\nor do athletics for a living, which I don't.\\n\\nSo there is some evidence from the literature\\n\\nthat one can get away with, or I don't even know\\n\\nthat we should think about it as getting away with,\\n\\nbut that one can do longer hold static stretches\\n\\nof up to say 60 seconds, but do fewer total sessions\\n\\nper week.\\n\\nSo rather than three 30 second static holds,\\n\\ndoing three 60 second static holds\\n\\nand doing those every other day.\\n\\nAnd there really hasn't been a systematic exploration\\n\\nof this, the article that I was referring to\\n\\njust a few moments ago, this analysis of the 23 articles\\n\\nwas combined into this enormous set of tables\\n\\nand some really quite nice graphs\\n\\nthat you're welcome to look at\\n\\nsince we're going to provide a link to the study.\\n\\nThere are a couple of key takeaways that I want to mention\\n\\nthat are separate from this issue of how long to stretch\\n\\nand how often.\\n\\nFirst of all, they describe in their discussion\\n\\nthat there were improvements in range of motion\\n\\nindependent of whether or not people did static stretching,\\n\\nactive stretching, passive stretching,\\n\\nballistic stretching, or PNF stretching.\\n\\nSo all of those forms of stretching\\n\\nwill improve limb range of motion.\\n\\nThis is essential to point out,\\n\\nand I want to emphasize this.\\n\\nStatic stretching, however, gave the greatest degree\\n\\nof gains in limb range of motion.\\n\\nAnd on average, they saw a 20.9% increase,\\n\\nbut some of the other increases they observed\\n\\nwere also quite substantial.\\n\\nSo ballistic stretching can also provide\\n\\nsome pretty impressive limb range of motion improvements.\\n\\nHowever, they tended to be in the range of,\\n\\nhere they point out 11.65% increase,\\n\\nor in the case of PNF, a 15% increase.\\n\\nSo it appears that the greatest improvements\\n\\nin limb range of motion for your time spent and effort spent\\n\\nis going to be this minimum of five minutes per week\\n\\nto elicit a significant response with five days\\n\\nbeing the minimum weekly recommended frequency\\n\\nto achieve significant range of motion improvements.\\n\\nI confess this was pretty surprising to me\\n\\nwhen I compare flexibility training to say,\\n\\nresistance training for strength and hypertrophy.\\n\\nI've had the experience,\\n\\nand I know that other people have the experience,\\n\\nand I think Dr. Andy Galpin would probably agree\\n\\nthat provided one trains hard enough and appropriately\\n\\nthat you don't need to train resistance training\\n\\nfive days a week in order to get significant improvements\\n\\nin strength and hypertrophy.\\n\\nSome people might need to,\\n\\nbut you can get a lot of positive results\\n\\nin those variables with less frequent training,\\n\\ncertainly with three or four days a week of training.\\n\\nAnd for cardiovascular training,\\n\\nI'm not aware of anyone having tested\\n\\nwhether or not one very long run each week\\n\\ncan actually increase cardiovascular fitness\\n\\nand you're not doing anything else.\\n\\nAlthough I have to imagine you'd probably see\\n\\nsome improvement compared to not doing anything.\\n\\nBut most people are doing repeated training sessions\\n\\nof cardiovascular strength training.\\n\\nNot a lot of people are doing five days a week\\n\\nof strength training, at least that I'm aware of.\\n\\nSome people are, but most people I think are not.\\n\\nAnd some people are doing five or more days a week\\n\\nof cardiovascular training.\\n\\nI'm guessing that most people are not doing five days a week\\n\\nof dedicated static stretch,\\n\\nrange of motion directed training.\\n\\nBut it does appear that that frequency about the week,\\n\\ngetting those repeated sessions,\\n\\neven if they are short for an individual muscle group,\\n\\nturns out to be important.\\n\\nAnd so that points to the, perhaps the reason\\n\\nwhy so few people are doing dedicated range of motion work.\\n\\nBut it also reminds me that all of the studies\\n\\nthat were described, at least in this review,\\n\\nand some of the other ones that were not,\\n\\nreally show impressive changes in limb range of motion.\\n\\nI mean, 20 plus percent, or even 15% with PNF.\\n\\nI mean, these are big changes that are going to benefit us.\\n\\nThey're going to offset the age-related losses\\n\\nin flexibility for sure,\\n\\nif one is dedicated about these practices.\\n\\nAnd in many cases, they're going to increase\\n\\nlimb range of motion in ways that are going to allow us\\n\\nbetter performance in certain physical endeavors,\\n\\ncertainly better balance,\\n\\nor we haven't really talked about balance and stability,\\n\\nbut range of motion can impair balance and stability\\n\\nin some extreme circumstances,\\n\\nbut by and large, limb range of motion,\\n\\nlack of tightness, improved posture,\\n\\nimproved physical performance, excuse me,\\n\\nand things of that sort is something that\\n\\nI think we can all benefit from,\\n\\nand that are key features of longevity.\\n\\nWe don't often think of them\\n\\nbecause we so prioritize cardiovascular health\\n\\nand the relationship between the heart and brain health\\n\\nand resistance training and musculoskeletal hypertrophy\\n\\nor strength, et cetera.\\n\\nBut as I delved into this literature,\\n\\nit really highlighted for me the extent to which\\n\\nhaving really good limb range of motion,\\n\\nat least maintaining limb range of motion\\n\\nas we age from year to year,\\n\\nand maybe even improving limb range of motion\\n\\ncan be immensely beneficial for reducing pain,\\n\\nfor, again, improving posture,\\n\\nimproving our ability to perform, to walk, et cetera.\\n\\nAnd indeed, there's a whole literature\\n\\nthat relates our limb range of motion\\n\\nto things like pain management\\n\\nof things related to headache and so on and so forth.\\n\\nSo limb range of motion is not just about\\n\\nbecoming a contortionist\\n\\nor being able to complete the yoga class.\\n\\nIt really is about maintaining the integrity and the health\\n\\nof the neuromuscular system, the connective tissue,\\n\\nand the neuromuscular connective network,\\n\\nbecause those are indeed working\\n\\nas an ecosystem and a network.\\n\\nI'd like to just briefly touch on PNF stretching\\n\\nfor a moment.\\n\\nAgain, this is a vast landscape with many parameters\\n\\nand different practitioners,\\n\\na lot of competing opinions out there, to put it lightly.\\n\\nNonetheless, I do want to emphasize\\n\\nthat the PNF training leverages those spindle mechanisms\\n\\nand GTO mechanisms that we talked about earlier.\\n\\nBut I realized that in describing\\n\\nthe quadricep contraction hamstring stretch,\\n\\nlittle mini experiment that hopefully you did,\\n\\nthat I didn't really highlight the role of the GTOs,\\n\\nthe Golgi tendon organs that much.\\n\\nAnd I just would like to just briefly do that for a moment.\\n\\nThe GTOs have multiple functions.\\n\\nIn fact, I think even though GTOs\\n\\nare in every medical textbook, every physiology textbook,\\n\\nevery first year neuroscientist learns about them\\n\\nwhen learning about the neuromuscular junctions\\n\\nand the mechanisms of interoception, et cetera,\\n\\nthey are likely to have other functions as well.\\n\\nAnd one of the reasons why PNF stretching does work,\\n\\nwhether or not you're doing that by using a strap\\n\\nto pull back a limb or whether or not\\n\\nyou're actively contracting your quadriceps\\n\\nto then release and emphasize stretch range of motion\\n\\nfor your hamstrings and related muscle groups\\n\\nis that activation of those GTOs,\\n\\nmeaning putting loads and tension into that system\\n\\ncan inhibit the spindles\\n\\nin the opposite antagonistic muscle groups.\\n\\nAnd so one of the reasons why flexing\\n\\nor I should say contracting your quadriceps\\n\\nreally intensely for some period of time\\n\\nallows your hamstrings to subsequently experience\\n\\ngreater range of motion.\\n\\nAnd again, it's not just the hamstrings,\\n\\nbut the related connective tissue and neural circuits,\\n\\net cetera, is because yes, it's quote unquote relaxing\\n\\nthe hamstrings and the spindle,\\n\\nbut there's also a direct relationship\\n\\nbetween activation of the GTOs in the quadricep\\n\\nand release of the spindles in the hamstring\\n\\nand related muscles.\\n\\nThis has a name, it's called autogenic inhibition.\\n\\nIt's a fancy name for contraction of one muscle group,\\n\\nproviding a relaxation of the other muscle group\\n\\nthat's antagonistic to it.\\n\\nAnd it relates back to this idea\\n\\nof interleaving sets in the gym.\\n\\nSo if you think back to that example,\\n\\nnow it should make sense as to why, for instance,\\n\\nif you do, let's say a set of bench presses\\n\\nor shoulder presses and you,\\n\\nlet's say you get 10 repetitions and you fail on the 11th,\\n\\nthat muscle is very, very fatigued.\\n\\nIf you were to rest some period of time\\n\\nand then go back and do another set,\\n\\nwell, during the rest, that muscle group has been relaxing.\\n\\nIt's obviously not contracting the same way it was\\n\\nduring the resistance set,\\n\\nbut by going and doing a pulling exercise\\n\\nthat involves the antagonistic muscle group,\\n\\nso strongly contracting the back muscles through a pull\\n\\nlike a pull down or a chin up or a row type exercise,\\n\\nyou're activating or near activating the GTO system\\n\\nin those pulling muscles in a way\\n\\nthat provides autogenic inhibition for the pushing muscles.\\n\\nNow, again, the physios out there are probably\\n\\neither screaming or banging their heads\\n\\nagainst whatever sound system this happens\\n\\nto be arriving through to them saying, wait,\\n\\nbut in many cases, the GTOs aren't activated enough\\n\\nto provide that autogenic inhibition.\\n\\nThat's true, but even the sub-threshold activation\\n\\nof those intraspinal circuits,\\n\\nso the place where the GTO circuit\\n\\nand the spindle circuit interact,\\n\\ncan provide an additional replenishment of, say,\\n\\nthe pushing muscles while you're activating\\n\\nthose pulling muscles.\\n\\nAnd this is at least one, not the only,\\n\\nbut at least one mechanisms by which interleaving\\n\\npush and pull, push and pull,\\n\\nfor both strength and hypertrophy training,\\n\\nbut also for range of motion stretching type training,\\n\\ncan allow you to achieve better results\\n\\nin a shorter period of time.\\n\\nAnd I raise this because I want to keep in mind\\n\\nthe efficiency of any training program.\\n\\nWe just a moment ago established that doing,\\n\\nfor example, three sets of 30 second static holds\\n\\ncan be very useful for the hamstrings with,\\n\\nlet's just say for sake of simplicity and practicality,\\n\\na minute's rest in between.\\n\\nBut during that minute's rest,\\n\\nyou can stretch the opposite antagonistic muscle group,\\n\\nsuch as the quadriceps.\\n\\nOr if you want to use PNF training,\\n\\nyou could do loading of the quadriceps in between.\\n\\nSo there are a number of different ways\\n\\nin which you can start to interleave\\n\\nstatic stretching with PNF stretching.\\n\\nYou can start to interleave even PNF type protocols\\n\\nwith resistance training,\\n\\nalthough that gets a bit more complicated.\\n\\nYou can really start to construct and build protocols\\n\\nthat are ideal for you.\\n\\nWhat we will do is for an upcoming\\n\\nneural network newsletter.\\n\\nSo for those of you that aren't familiar,\\n\\nthe Huberman Lab podcast has a so-called\\n\\nneural network newsletter.\\n\\nThese are monthly newsletters\\n\\nwhere we put distilled points from the podcast\\n\\nand oftentimes protocols in a downloadable PDF form.\\n\\nYou can access it by giving us your email.\\n\\nWe don't share your email with anybody.\\n\\nIf you want to see examples of these,\\n\\nyou can go to hubermanlab.com\\n\\nand go to the menu and see newsletter.\\n\\nYou don't have to sign up for anything to see examples\\n\\nof what these are like.\\n\\nI'll provide a couple of different protocols.\\n\\nOne that is pure static stretching,\\n\\none that involves PNF type stretching,\\n\\nand I'll also put down a protocol\\n\\nthat involves the antagonistic interleaved muscle training\\n\\nof the sort that I've been describing a few times\\n\\nthroughout this episode.\\n\\nAnd then you can try and apply those either separately\\n\\nor maybe combine them in some way\\n\\nthat's useful for your goals.\\n\\nThere are a couple of key elements\\n\\nthat are essential for building a safe and effective\\n\\nrange of motion increasing program\\n\\nthat arrived to us both through the peer reviewed research\\n\\nand admittedly from people that have been involved\\n\\nin teaching and training range of motion\\n\\nfor a very long period of time.\\n\\nSome of you may be familiar\\n\\nwith the so-called Anderson method.\\n\\nIt's been around for a long time.\\n\\nActually, I've never met Anderson.\\n\\nI should know this.\\n\\nI don't even know if he's still alive.\\n\\nI hope he's still alive.\\n\\nBut in any event, there are a lot of different features\\n\\nto the Anderson and other protocols.\\n\\nBut one of the aspects of the Anderson protocol\\n\\nthat I think is highly relevant,\\n\\nin fact, I know is relevant to the peer reviewed research\\n\\nthat we're going to talk about in a few moments\\n\\nis this notion of pushing through pain\\n\\nand how active or how passive to be about static stretching.\\n\\nNow, this is somewhat subjective, right?\\n\\nIf you think about getting into a stretch,\\n\\nagain, we'll just use the hamstrings, for example.\\n\\nSo you're either reaching for your toes while seated\\n\\nor maybe you're using a strap\\n\\nand you're raising your foot overhead while lying down\\n\\nor maybe you're doing a toe touch type exercise.\\n\\nHow far should you reach?\\n\\nWhere is the end range of motion?\\n\\nShould you bounce?\\n\\nShould you not bounce?\\n\\nWe're going to talk a little bit more about that in a moment.\\n\\nBut Anderson has an interesting idea and principle\\n\\nwhich is thread through a lot of his teachings\\n\\nthat I think are very much in keeping with the study\\n\\nthat I'm about to describe next,\\n\\nwhere he emphasizes to, yes,\\n\\nto stretch to the end of the range of motion,\\n\\nbut not to focus so much on where that range of motion\\n\\nhappens to be that day.\\n\\nSo for instance, not thinking,\\n\\noh, I can always touch my toes, for instance.\\n\\nAnd therefore that's the starting place\\n\\nfor my flexibility training today.\\n\\nBut rather to take the entirety of your system\\n\\ninto account each day and understand that,\\n\\nokay, provided you're warmed up appropriately,\\n\\nthat you're now going to stretch your hamstrings,\\n\\nfor instance, and you're going to reach down for your toes,\\n\\nbut that your range of motion might be adjusted that day\\n\\nby way of tension and stress\\n\\nor by way of ambient temperature in the room.\\n\\nAnd to basically define the end range of motion\\n\\nas the place where you can feel the stretch\\n\\nin the relevant muscle groups.\\n\\nI think this is important because\\n\\nunlike resistance training or cardiovascular training,\\n\\nwhere we can measure distance traveled over time\\n\\nin the case of cardiovascular training\\n\\nor how much weight is on the bar\\n\\nand count repetitions, et cetera,\\n\\nwith range of motion training, of course,\\n\\nrange of motion is the feature that we're interested in,\\n\\nbut there is likely to be a lot of variation from day to day\\n\\nbased on a number of different internal\\n\\nand external factors.\\n\\nAnd so the Anderson method is really about\\n\\ngetting into static and other forms of stretching.\\n\\nI think today we've mainly been focusing\\n\\non static stretching and holding the end range of motion,\\n\\nbut really paying attention to the feel of the stretch\\n\\nand the muscles involved.\\n\\nAnd there are parallels in resistance\\n\\nand cardiovascular training too, I realize, right?\\n\\nIn the case of trying to build hypertrophy,\\n\\nor I should say improve hypertrophy muscle size,\\n\\noftentimes the best advice that one can give is to\\n\\ndon't try to lift weights, but rather to challenge muscles.\\n\\nNow, of course, you need to provide adequate loads\\n\\nin order to get hypertrophy,\\n\\nbut when you're training purely for strength,\\n\\nit's about moving weights.\\n\\nWhen you're training purely for hypertrophy\\n\\nor mainly for hypertrophy,\\n\\nit's really about challenging muscles using weights\\n\\nor other forms of resistance.\\n\\nAnd similarly, and in keeping with this Anderson method,\\n\\nwhen trying to build limb range of motion,\\n\\ndoing static stretching at a place where it's difficult,\\n\\nbut that you can experience the stretch of the muscle\\n\\ncognitively, consciously,\\n\\nbeing able to focus on the muscles and their stretch\\n\\nis at least as useful as is evaluating\\n\\nthe current range of motion you're able to achieve.\\n\\nSo what does this mean?\\n\\nThis means feel the muscles as you stretch them,\\n\\ndon't just go through the motions.\\n\\nAnd this means don't get so attached\\n\\nto being able to always achieve, for instance,\\n\\na stretch of a given distance within a given session.\\n\\nYou might actually find that by just finding the place\\n\\nwhere you can't get much further\\n\\nand holding the static stretch there,\\n\\nthat on the second and third set\\n\\nthat you happen to be doing that day,\\n\\nthat your range of motion will be increased considerably.\\n\\nMaybe not, but very likely, yes, you will.\\n\\nAnd of course, evaluating range of motion over time\\n\\nis the key parameter because that's the goal\\n\\nof all this type of work.\\n\\nNow, along these lines, there is this variable\\n\\nthat we've mentioned a few times\\n\\nof passive versus active stretching.\\n\\nAnd there's this even more nebulous variable,\\n\\nthis even more kind of subjective thing\\n\\nof how much effort to put into it.\\n\\nShould you push into the stretch?\\n\\nDo you even want to bounce a tiny bit?\\n\\nWould you want to reach into that endpoint\\n\\nand try and extend it within a given set and session?\\n\\nAnd for that reason, I was excited to find this paper\\n\\nentitled, A Comparison of Two Stretching Modalities\\n\\non Lower Limb Range of Motion Measurements\\n\\nin Recreational Dancers.\\n\\nHappens to be done in recreational dancers.\\n\\nIt's a six-week intervention program\\n\\nthat compared low-intensity stretching,\\n\\nwhich they call micro-stretching.\\n\\nThey used a capital M,\\n\\nso I don't know if that means that it's proprietary,\\n\\nalthough I didn't see evidence of conflict of interest.\\n\\nBut they call it micro-stretching.\\n\\nBut to be very clear, micro-stretching\\n\\nin the case of this manuscript is low-intensity stretching.\\n\\nAnd they compared that with moderate-intensity\\n\\nstatic stretching on an active and passive ranges of motion.\\n\\nOkay, so there are a lot of different variables are here,\\n\\nbut I'll just highlight a few things\\n\\nthat are really most relevant to us.\\n\\nAnd I'll give you the takeaway at the outset\\n\\nand then return to it at the end,\\n\\nso that if I lose any of your attention\\n\\nin the next couple of minutes,\\n\\nat least you have that key takeaway.\\n\\nBasically, what they found\\n\\nwas that a six-week training program\\n\\nusing very low-intensity stretching\\n\\nhad a greater positive effect on lower limb range of motion\\n\\nthan did moderate-intensity static stretching.\\n\\nI find that incredibly interesting.\\n\\nSo very low-intensity,\\n\\nand we'll define what that means in a moment.\\n\\nHere I'm quoting them.\\n\\nThe most interesting aspect of the study\\n\\nwas the greater increase in active range of motion\\n\\ncompared to passive range of motion\\n\\nby the micro-stretching group.\\n\\nSo this relates to what we were just talking about\\n\\na few moments ago as it relates to the Anderson method,\\n\\nwhich is that very low-intensity stretching,\\n\\nmeaning effort that feels not painful,\\n\\nand in fact might even feel easy\\n\\nor at least not straining\\n\\nto exceed a given range of motion,\\n\\nturns out to not just be as effective,\\n\\nbut more effective than moderate-intensity stretching.\\n\\nSo what is low-intensity static stretching?\\n\\nWell, they define this as the stretches were completed\\n\\nat an intensity of 30 to 40%,\\n\\nwhere 100% equals the point of pain, right?\\n\\nSo 30 to 40% in these individuals,\\n\\nand again, I'm paraphrasing,\\n\\ninduced a relaxed state within the individual\\n\\nand the specific muscle,\\n\\nand here they were holding these static stretches,\\n\\nI should mention, for one minute, not 30 seconds.\\n\\nNow the control group\\n\\nwas doing the exact same overall protocol,\\n\\nso daily stretching for six weeks, the same exercises,\\n\\nholding each set for 60 seconds,\\n\\nbut we're using an intensity of stretch of 80%,\\n\\nwhere again, 100 represents the point of pain,\\n\\nthe point where the person would want to stop stretching.\\n\\nI find these data incredibly interesting\\n\\nfor I think what ought to be obvious reasons.\\n\\nIf you're going to embark on a flexibility\\n\\nand stretching training program,\\n\\nyou don't need to push to the point of pain.\\n\\nIn fact, it seems that even just approaching\\n\\nthe point of pain is going to be less effective\\n\\nthan operating at this 30 to 40% of intensity\\n\\nprior to reaching that pain threshold,\\n\\nthe pain threshold being 100%.\\n\\nNow, of course, this is pretty subjective,\\n\\nbut I think all of us should be able to register\\n\\nwithin ourselves, so whether a given range of motion\\n\\nor extending a given range of motion\\n\\nbrings us to that threshold of pain or near pain,\\n\\nand according to this study at least,\\n\\noperating or performing stretching\\n\\nat an intensity that's quite low, that's very relaxing,\\n\\nturns out to be more beneficial\\n\\nin increasing range of motion\\n\\nthan is doing exercises aimed at increasing range of motion\\n\\nat a higher intensity.\\n\\nOkay, so lower intensity stretching,\\n\\nI should say lower intensity static stretching\\n\\nappears to be the most beneficial way\\n\\nto approach stretching, and I think that's a relief,\\n\\nprobably to many of us, because it also suggests\\n\\nthat the injury risk is going to be lower\\n\\nthan if one were pushing into the pain zone, so to speak.\\n\\nThe authors offer a number of different explanations\\n\\nas to why this approach, this micro-stretching approach\\n\\nmight be more effective.\\n\\nHere, I'm paraphrasing from their discussion\\n\\nwhere they mentioned that it could be hypothesized\\n\\nthat they had improved reciprocal inhibition\\n\\nwithin the hamstring muscle group,\\n\\nso this gets right back to the sorts of neural mechanisms\\n\\nthat we talked about before,\\n\\nthat somehow by doing this low intensity stretching\\n\\nthat they were able to access some of those spindle\\n\\nand GTO type mechanisms that we were referring to earlier\\n\\nand the inhibition of hamstring and quadricep stretches.\\n\\nThey also offer a number of different ideas\\n\\nabout how this could shift the activation\\n\\nof the so-called sympathetic,\\n\\nremember the kind of stress division of our nervous system,\\n\\nand to reduce that relative to activation\\n\\nof the parasympathetic arm of the nervous system.\\n\\nI confess they have a couple of arguments\\n\\naround sympathetic, parasympathetic\\n\\nthat are somewhat convoluted.\\n\\nI will just, in fairness to the neuroscience\\n\\non those systems, I wouldn't suggest putting too much weight\\n\\non their arguments about sympathetic and parasympathetic.\\n\\nTo my mind, they didn't really hold much water,\\n\\nbut here I'm not trying to be disparaging\\n\\nof the overall work, which I think is really quite sound,\\n\\nwhich is that low intensity, so-called micro stretching,\\n\\nis going to be the most effective way\\n\\nto increase limb range of movement over time.\\n\\nI want to just briefly return to this idea\\n\\nof whether or not to do ballistic or static stretching\\n\\nbefore some sort of skill training or weight training\\n\\nor any kind of sport or even cardiovascular exercise\\n\\nlike running.\\n\\nAgain, the data are really split out there.\\n\\nThere are even folks who suggest\\n\\nthat doing any kind of stretching prior to running\\n\\nis going to lower running efficiency.\\n\\nIt's going to require essentially more work\\n\\nand more oxygen uptake at a given speed\\n\\nfor a variety of reasons,\\n\\nand runners and that community argue about this endlessly.\\n\\nThere are papers in both sides, in both directions.\\n\\nI'm sure I'll hear about some of this in the comments.\\n\\nI'm not really going to take a stance on this\\n\\nas a consequence because the data are all over the place.\\n\\nHowever, I think there's a general logic\\n\\nthat we can apply, and here I'm borrowing\\n\\nfrom some conversations and some information put out there\\n\\nby Dr. Andy Galpin, who I think is, of course,\\n\\nboth an expert and thinks about these things\\n\\nin a really sound and flexible way, no pun intended.\\n\\nThere are instances, for example,\\n\\nwhere an individual might want to do some static stretching\\n\\nto increase limb range of motion\\n\\nprior to doing weight training,\\n\\neven if it's going to inhibit that person's ability\\n\\nto lift as much weight.\\n\\nWhy would you want to do that?\\n\\nWell, for instance, if somebody has a tightness\\n\\nor a limitation in their neuromuscular\\n\\nconnective tissue system,\\n\\nsomeplace in their body and system\\n\\nthat prevents them from using proper form\\n\\nthat they can overcome by doing some static stretching,\\n\\nwell, that would be a great idea, as Dr. Galpin points out.\\n\\nOr for instance, if proper stability within the movement\\n\\nrequires increasing limb range of motion in some way,\\n\\nwell, then compromising the use of greater loads\\n\\ncould be greatly offset by doing some static stretching\\n\\nto improve, say, hamstring flexibility\\n\\nor another muscle group flexibility.\\n\\nSo we can't always think about just what's going to allow us\\n\\nor inhibit us from using the maximal amount of weight\\n\\nor from running as far as we want to run,\\n\\nas fast as we want to run.\\n\\nThere are instances where people are trying\\n\\nto overcome injuries, where they're trying to come back\\n\\nfrom a reparative surgery or something of that sort,\\n\\ncoming back from a layoff,\\n\\nwhere some additional static stretching\\n\\nprior to cardiovascular weight training\\n\\nor skill training or sport of some kind\\n\\nis going to be useful\\n\\nbecause it's going to put us in a position\\n\\nof greater safety and confidence and performance overall,\\n\\neven if it's adjusting down our speed\\n\\nor the total amount of loads that we use.\\n\\nSo it's you that needs to consider\\n\\nwhether or not for you and within a given training session,\\n\\nyou want to do static training,\\n\\nI should say static stretching range of motion training\\n\\nprior to or after that training session.\\n\\nAnd similarly, there are a lot of data pointing to the fact\\n\\nthat doing some dynamic or even ballistic stretching\\n\\nprior to skill training\\n\\nor cardiovascular weight training can be beneficial\\n\\nin part to warm up the relevant neural circuits,\\n\\njoints and connective tissue and muscles,\\n\\nand as well to perhaps improve range of motion\\n\\nor ability to perform those movements more accurately\\n\\nwith more stability and therefore with more confidence.\\n\\nAnd while Dr. Andy Galpin\\n\\nwould never name any protocol after himself,\\n\\nhe's far too humble to do that,\\n\\nI've named a couple of protocols after him,\\n\\nparticularly the Galpin equation for hydration\\n\\nbecause he was willing to stick his neck out there\\n\\nand put down some specific numbers\\n\\nthat people could follow\\n\\nin order to ensure proper hydration during training.\\n\\nYou can look up the Galpin equation elsewhere,\\n\\nyou can just Google it or look elsewhere, you'll find it.\\n\\nAnd Dr. Galpin has also been very thoughtful and generous\\n\\nand I think very accurate\\n\\nin offering a kind of a general organizational logic\\n\\nfor how to think about the goals\\n\\nof a particular training session\\n\\nand thereby to decide whether or not you're going to do\\n\\nballistic or static stretching and so on and so forth.\\n\\nSo we can refer to this general approach as Galpinian,\\n\\nGalpinian, is that right?\\n\\nGalpinian logic, Galpinian logic.\\n\\nThus far we've been talking about stretching\\n\\nfor sake of increasing limb flexibility and range of motion,\\n\\nbut there are other reasons perhaps\\n\\nto embark on a stretching protocol\\n\\nthat include both our ability to relax\\n\\nand access deep relaxation quickly,\\n\\nas well as even to reduce inflammation\\n\\nand perhaps even combat certain forms of cancer.\\n\\nAnd if that sounds really far-fetched,\\n\\nI want to emphasize that the study\\n\\nI'm about to share with you in a moment\\n\\nwas actually carried out by one of the directors\\n\\nof a division of the National Institutes of Health.\\n\\nAnd this was the work of Helene Langevin,\\n\\nwho's a medical doctor, has done really important work\\n\\non the mechanisms underlying things like acupuncture\\n\\nand has approached all that\\n\\nfrom a very mechanistic viewpoint, right?\\n\\nSo not looking just at the effects of acupuncture,\\n\\nbut really trying to understand what sorts of cytokines,\\n\\ninflammatory molecules and pathways are activated,\\n\\nwhat sorts of neural mechanisms get engaged\\n\\nby things like acupuncture\\n\\nthat impinges on the fascial tissues and so forth.\\n\\nAnd Dr. Langevin is currently a director\\n\\nof the National Institutes of Complementary Health\\n\\nand Medicine at the National Institutes of Health.\\n\\nSo this is a major division supported by tax dollars\\n\\nthat support systematic mechanistic exploration\\n\\nof things like respiration, meditation, yoga, acupuncture.\\n\\nSo this is serious science applied to protocols\\n\\nand approaches that have been used for some period of time,\\n\\nbut really aimed at trying to understand\\n\\nwhat would the best protocols be to evolve new protocols.\\n\\nSo there's a really interesting study done in animal models,\\n\\nbut I think it's a powerful enough result\\n\\nthat I think we all should pay attention to it.\\n\\nThe title of this paper, and again,\\n\\nthe last author is Dr. Langevin herself,\\n\\nis stretching reduces tumor growth\\n\\nin a mouse breast cancer model.\\n\\nAnd yes, you can get mice to stretch.\\n\\nIt turns out that if you gently lift up mice by their tail\\n\\nand they'll hold onto their cage,\\n\\nthere's a way in which you can mechanically stretch them\\n\\nin a way that doesn't harm them.\\n\\nFirst, I should mention that Dr. Langevin and others\\n\\nhave shown that just a brief whole body stretch\\n\\nof that sort induces an increase in activation\\n\\nof the parasympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system.\\n\\nAgain, not arm, limb, arm,\\n\\nbut the aspect of the autonomic nervous system\\n\\nthat creates a whole body,\\n\\nwhole nervous system shift toward more relaxation.\\n\\nSo yes, indeed, stretching induces relaxation\\n\\nat a systemic level, not just at a local level.\\n\\nAnd I think that's important,\\n\\nprobably not surprising to those of you\\n\\nthat use stretching regularly,\\n\\nbut yes, it does indeed relax us.\\n\\nYes, you can do this in mice and see that in mice as well.\\n\\nHere's what they did for this current study.\\n\\nOr I should say this was a study published in 2018\\n\\nin Scientific Reports.\\n\\nThey write, recent studies have shown\\n\\nthat gentle daily stretching for 10 minutes\\n\\ncan reduce local connective tissue inflammation and fibrosis.\\n\\nNow that's local tissue inflammation and fibrosis.\\n\\nAs well, we now know as systemic inflammation\\n\\nand can induce relaxation systemically.\\n\\nIn this case, they focused on mice, not humans.\\n\\nAnd mice were randomized to a stretch\\n\\nversus no stretch condition\\n\\nand were treated for 10 minutes once a day for four weeks.\\n\\nSo it's 10 minutes of this passive whole body stretching\\n\\na day for four weeks.\\n\\nWhat's remarkable, I mean, just I have to say\\n\\nis just striking is that tumor volume in these mice,\\n\\nthey were able to induce tumors in these mice\\n\\nand the tumor volume at the end point was 52% smaller\\n\\nin the stretch group compared to the no stretch group.\\n\\nThis is a highly significant effect.\\n\\nAnd they point out in the absence of any other treatment.\\n\\nAnd they explored whether or not cytotoxic immune responses\\n\\nwere activated and a number of other features.\\n\\nThey weren't able to get too deeply\\n\\ninto the underlying mechanisms,\\n\\nbut this is pretty remarkable.\\n\\nEven three weeks into this stretching protocol,\\n\\nthis daily stretching protocol for these mice,\\n\\ntumor volume was reduced.\\n\\nI mean, by, you know, it's almost halved.\\n\\nThis is pretty incredible.\\n\\nSo they have these measures of tumor volume.\\n\\nAnd the only difference in the way these animals\\n\\nwere treated and handled was the introduction\\n\\nof this daily stretch.\\n\\nI find this result to be of course,\\n\\nlimited to the extent that it's done in an animal model,\\n\\nnot in humans, we have to point it out.\\n\\nBut as they point out in their discussion,\\n\\nour results demonstrate a 52% reduction\\n\\nin mammary tumor growth over one month\\n\\nin mice undergoing stretching for 10 minutes a day\\n\\nwithout any other form of therapy.\\n\\nDo they think that stretching itself\\n\\nis changing the tumor size?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nIn fact, they raised the possibility that stretching\\n\\nbecause of its impact on the fascia\\n\\nmight even create micro environments\\n\\nthat are more permissive for tumor growth\\n\\nin certain instances.\\n\\nSo they're careful to emphasize\\n\\nwhat I also believe to be the case,\\n\\nwhich is that it's unlikely that the stretching itself\\n\\nwas directly acting to reduce tumor size,\\n\\nbut rather that there's this possible link\\n\\nbetween inflammation and immune exhaustion mechanisms\\n\\nthat if you can periodically relax a nervous system\\n\\nhere through stretching,\\n\\nthat it can affect certain pathways\\n\\nrelated to the immune system\\n\\nthat would allow the immune system\\n\\nto combat tumor growth to a significant degree.\\n\\nSo again, even though this is a study in mice,\\n\\nit argues that relaxation induced by stretching\\n\\ncan have a powerful influence on mammary tumor growth.\\n\\nAgain, a huge effect carried out\\n\\nby one of the premier labs\\n\\nand individuals who do this sort of work\\n\\nand think about this sort of thing.\\n\\nAnd of course, I want to point out\\n\\nit wasn't just Dr. Langevin that did this study.\\n\\nThere are a number of co-authors on the study.\\n\\nWe will provide a link to the co-authors.\\n\\nExcuse me, we will provide a link to the study\\n\\nso that you can peruse it in more detail if you like.\\n\\nNow, as a related and somewhat final point,\\n\\nI'd like to return to this idea and this place,\\n\\nthis real estate within our brain\\n\\nthat we call the insular cortex, the insula.\\n\\nAs you recall, way back at the beginning of this episode,\\n\\nwe were talking about the von Economo neurons\\n\\nthat Constantine von Economo,\\n\\nthe Austrian scientist discovered.\\n\\nAnd the fact that we are able to make\\n\\nand perform interpretations of our internal landscape,\\n\\npain, our dedication to a practice,\\n\\nfor instance, whether or not we are in pain\\n\\nbecause it's a practice that we are doing intentionally\\n\\nand want to improve ourselves,\\n\\nor whether or not it's pain that's arriving\\n\\nthrough some externally imposed demands or situations.\\n\\nWell, the insula is handling all that.\\n\\nAnd fortunately, there's a wonderful paper\\n\\nthat was published a few years ago now\\n\\nin the journal Cerebral Cortex, which is a fine journal.\\n\\nThis is the year 2014,\\n\\nentitled Insular Cortex Mediates Increased Pain Tolerance\\n\\nin Yoga Practitioners.\\n\\nI'll tell you why I like this study.\\n\\nI'm personally not a practitioner of yoga.\\n\\nI've taken a few yoga classes over the years.\\n\\nI've done some of the hot yoga classes.\\n\\nThose rooms can get really, really warm, I confess.\\n\\nAnd I've done the kind of standard yoga every now and again.\\n\\nIt's not something that I've kept up regularly.\\n\\nThis study explored the effects\\n\\non brain structure volume in yoga practitioners.\\n\\nAnd for those of you out there\\n\\nthat are aficionados in yoga,\\n\\nthey pulled subjects from having backgrounds in the,\\n\\nhere, I'm probably going to mispronounce\\n\\nthese different things.\\n\\nAnd forgive me, the vinyasa yogas,\\n\\nthe ashtanga yogas, the yongar yogas, the sunanda yogas.\\n\\nOkay, so some people were new to these practices.\\n\\nSome were experienced.\\n\\nThe important takeaways were\\n\\nthat they took these yoga practitioners\\n\\nand they didn't explore their brain structure\\n\\nin the context of yoga itself.\\n\\nThey looked at things like pain tolerance.\\n\\nSo they used thermal stimulation.\\n\\nBasically, they put people into conditions\\n\\nwhere they gave them very hot or very cold stimuli\\n\\nand compared those yoga practitioners\\n\\nof varying levels of yoga experience\\n\\nto those that had no experience with yoga,\\n\\nso-called controls.\\n\\nAnd they found some really interesting things.\\n\\nThere are a lot of data on this paper,\\n\\nbut here's something I'd like to highlight.\\n\\nThe pain tolerance of yoga practitioners\\n\\nwas double or more to that of non-yoga practitioners,\\n\\neven for those that weren't doing\\n\\nthe so-called hot yoga, right?\\n\\nThey also found that pain tolerance\\n\\nwas significantly greater,\\n\\nboth for heat pain and for cold pain.\\n\\nThey also found significant increases in insular,\\n\\nagain, the insula, this brain region, gray matter volume.\\n\\nTypically, when we talk about gray matter,\\n\\nwe're talking about the so-called cell bodies,\\n\\nthe location in neurons where the genome is housed\\n\\nand where all the housekeeping stuff is there.\\n\\nAnd then white matter volume tends to be the axons,\\n\\nthe wires, because they're in sheaths\\n\\nwith this stuff that appears white in MRIs\\n\\nand indeed is white under the microscope,\\n\\nand indeed is white, it's actually lipid, which is myelin.\\n\\nSo increased gray matter volume of the insula\\n\\nis a significant finding because what it suggests\\n\\nis that people that are doing yoga\\n\\nhave an increased volume of these areas of the brain\\n\\nthat are associated with interceptive awareness\\n\\nand for being able to make judgments about pain\\n\\nand why one is experiencing pain,\\n\\nnot just to lean away from pain,\\n\\nbut to utilize or leverage or even overcome pain.\\n\\nSo there are many studies of yoga and meditation out there,\\n\\nfew that have as much mechanistic detail as this one.\\n\\nAnd in fact, there's a beautiful figure,\\n\\nfigure three in this paper,\\n\\nthat shows that the gray matter volume\\n\\nof this particular brain region scales\\n\\nin an almost linear way with the duration of yoga practice\\n\\nthat somebody has been taking on in years.\\n\\nSo people that had, they had a few subjects\\n\\nthat have up to 15 or 16 years of yoga practice\\n\\nhad much larger left insular gray matter volume,\\n\\nbigger brain areas associated with these abilities.\\n\\nAnd I find this interesting\\n\\nbecause there are a lot of activities out there\\n\\nthat don't create these kinds of changes in brain volume,\\n\\nespecially within the insula.\\n\\nSo it appears that it's not just the performance\\n\\nof the yogic movements, but the overcoming\\n\\nor the kind of pushing into the end ranges of motion\\n\\nand to push through discomfort to some extent.\\n\\nOf course, we want people doing that\\n\\nin a healthy, safe way,\\n\\nbut that's allows yoga practitioners\\n\\nto build up the structure and function of these brain areas\\n\\nthat allow them to cope with pain better\\n\\nthan other individuals\\n\\nand to cope with other kinds of interceptive challenges,\\n\\nif you will, not just pain, but cold,\\n\\nnot just pain, but discomfort\\n\\nof being in a particular position to do that.\\n\\nAnd again, we wouldn't want people placing\\n\\nthemselves into a compromised position literally\\n\\nthat would harm them,\\n\\nespecially given that earlier we heard\\n\\nthat micro stretching of the kind of non-painful sword,\\n\\nlow intensity sword is actually going to be more effective\\n\\nfor increasing end range of motion.\\n\\nBut this study really emphasizes the extent\\n\\nto which practitioners of yoga don't just learn movements,\\n\\nthey learn how to control their nervous system\\n\\nin ways that really reshapes their relationship to pain,\\n\\nto flexibility and to the kinds of things\\n\\nthat the neuromuscular system was designed to do.\\n\\nAnd as a final point,\\n\\nthere's a beautiful graph in this paper,\\n\\nbeautiful I think because it explores\\n\\nsome of the more subjective dimensions\\n\\nof yoga and insular function,\\n\\nwhich is a, here I'll read it out in the nerdy form\\n\\nand then I'll explain what it means.\\n\\nThis is a frequency histogram\\n\\nof categories of mental strategies used by yogis\\n\\nversus controls during the cold pain tolerance task.\\n\\nWhat they're describing here and showing\\n\\nis quantitatively how people are conceptualizing cold pain\\n\\nin order to get through it.\\n\\nAnd the different categories are for instance,\\n\\ndistraction, right?\\n\\nSome people just choose to distract themselves from pain\\n\\nor to attempt to, other people will try to ignore it.\\n\\nIt's a lot like distraction, but nonetheless,\\n\\nto engage in a negative emotion,\\n\\nsort of like, like I'm going to dig,\\n\\nI'm going to be in resistance to this.\\n\\nControl subjects tended to use those approaches,\\n\\nwhereas practitioners of yoga tended to use other sorts\\n\\nof subjective approaches like positive imagery\\n\\nto some extent, the ability to relax\\n\\ndespite the extreme cold,\\n\\nthe ability to quote unquote accept,\\n\\nlike this is just happening despite the extreme cold,\\n\\nto observe, to third person themselves\\n\\nand the greatest effect of course was to breathe,\\n\\nto focus on their respiration as a way to deal\\n\\nwith this challenge, this cold challenge.\\n\\nNow, all of that is our subjective data,\\n\\nbut I want to remind you that the practitioners of yoga\\n\\nare not just using entirely different mental strategies,\\n\\nbut they are far more effective at dealing with pain.\\n\\nTheir pain tolerance is much higher\\n\\nas evidenced by the other data\\n\\nin the previous graphs in the paper.\\n\\nSo while this podcast episode is most certainly not\\n\\nabout yoga per se, it's about flexibility and stretching.\\n\\nFlexibility and stretching are elements\\n\\nwithin yogic practices.\\n\\nAnd of course, yogic practices involve breathing\\n\\nand mental work and a lot of other things,\\n\\nbalance, et cetera.\\n\\nIt's a vast landscape as many of you know.\\n\\nBut I think that if ever there was a manuscript\\n\\nthat pointed to the utility of something like yoga\\n\\nfor sake of tapping into a particular set\\n\\nof brain circuits and mechanisms that could wick out\\n\\ninto multiple dimensions of life.\\n\\nSo day-to-day life, stress, challenges in dealing\\n\\nwith all sorts of external stressors, career-related,\\n\\nfamily-related, relationally, et cetera, excuse me,\\n\\nbut as well for increasing range of motion,\\n\\nfor increasing flexibility.\\n\\nSo if ever there was a practice that one could embark on\\n\\nthat would not only increase flexibility\\n\\nand limb range of motion, but would also allow one\\n\\nto cultivate some improved mental functioning\\n\\nas it relates to pain tolerance\\n\\nand other features of stress management\\n\\nthat no doubt wick out into other areas of life.\\n\\nIt appears that yoga is a quite useful practice.\\n\\nAnd so for those of you that are interested\\n\\nin increasing limb range of motion,\\n\\nand you're already a practitioner of yoga, great.\\n\\nI can imagine that someday there'll be another study\\n\\nlike this one and you'll be in that 10 or 15\\n\\nto 16 year practitioner graph.\\n\\nYou'll be that dot way out on the far end of the graph\\n\\nthat shows that your insula is that much bigger\\n\\nthan the rest of ours.\\n\\nAnd therefore your internal awareness and pain thresholds\\n\\nand stress management will be that much better.\\n\\nBut of course, yoga isn't the only way\\n\\nto increase limb range of motion and flexibility.\\n\\nUp until now, we've described a number\\n\\nof different ways to do that.\\n\\nAnd we've arrived at some general themes and protocols.\\n\\nAgain, those themes and protocols will be distilled\\n\\ninto some specific and precise list\\n\\nin our neural network newsletter,\\n\\nbut we can revisit a couple of them now\\n\\njust in summary and synthesis.\\n\\nStatic stretching appears to be at least among\\n\\nthe more useful forms of stretching.\\n\\nSo low or zero momentum stretching,\\n\\ntypically at end range of motion.\\n\\nI love this concept of micro stretching,\\n\\neven though it's just a couple of studies\\n\\nthat have addressed whether or not high intensity\\n\\nor low intensity static stretch holds are more beneficial.\\n\\nThe idea and indeed the data that low intensity,\\n\\nso 30 to 40% of what one would consider painful\\n\\nappears to be more effective than 80% of that threshold.\\n\\nI find that incredibly interesting.\\n\\nAnd then there's this idea of frequency.\\n\\nIt really does appear that getting\\n\\nat least five minutes per week total\\n\\nof stretching for a given muscle group\\n\\nis important for creating meaningful lasting changes\\n\\nin limb range of motion.\\n\\nAnd that is best achieved by five day a week\\n\\nor six day a week or even seven day a week protocols,\\n\\nbut those can be very short protocols\\n\\nlimited to say three sets of 30,\\n\\nmaybe even 45 or 60 seconds of static hold.\\n\\nAlthough 30 seconds seems to be a key threshold there\\n\\nthat can get you maximum benefit.\\n\\nThere is no need to do full 60 second holds\\n\\nunless you're doing fewer total sessions per week.\\n\\nAnd of course, to always warm up\\n\\nor to arrive at the stretching session warm.\\n\\nAnd then of course, there are the other forms of stretching\\n\\nthat we touched upon a bit, things like PNF.\\n\\nAnd we talked about why PNF works,\\n\\nthings like the spindle and the Golgi tendon organ reflexes\\n\\nthat are built into all of us\\n\\nthat we arrive in this world with.\\n\\nAnd of course, the other forms of stretching\\n\\nthat are known to be effective and important\\n\\nsuch as dynamic and ballistic stretching.\\n\\nAgain, stretching protocols that involve a lot of momentum\\n\\nin order to improve range of motion\\n\\nfor performance of particular types of work\\n\\nthat one is about to embark on.\\n\\nTypically that would be physical work,\\n\\nbut a whole interesting and unexplored landscape\\n\\nis the extent to which changing limb range of motion\\n\\nand different types of body movement\\n\\nactually shape our cognitive abilities.\\n\\nAnd that will be the topic\\n\\nof a

people derive tremendous benefit from them\\n\\nfor things like improving the transition time\\n\\nand depth of sleep, or for improving focus,\\n\\nor for a variety of other things,\\n\\nincluding things like anxiety management.\\n\\nFor that reason, the Huberman Lab podcast\\n\\nhas decided to partner with Momentous Supplements.\\n\\nFirst of all, Momentous Supplements\\n\\nare of the very highest quality.\\n\\nThey're used by various professional sports teams,\\n\\nand they have contracts\\n\\nwith various government organizations\\n\\nexploring the role of particular supplements\\n\\nin human performance.\\n\\nSecond of all, they ship internationally\\n\\nbecause we know a number of you\\n\\nare outside the country of the United States.\\n\\nWe hope that will be

       " Document(page_content=\"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\n\\nwhere we discuss science\\n\\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\\n\\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\\n\\nand I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology\\n\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\n\\nToday, we are discussing dopamine.\\n\\nDopamine is a topic that I've covered before\\n\\non this podcast, and many people have heard of dopamine.\\n\\nMost people know that dopamine is involved in pleasure,\\n\\nto some extent or another.\\n\\nAnd nowadays, people are starting to appreciate\\n\\nthat dopamine is also intimately involved\\n\\nwith motivation, drive, and pursuit.\\n\\nWell, today, you're going to learn\\n\\nthat, indeed, dopamine is responsible\\n\\nfor all of those things,\\n\\nbut you are also going to learn\\n\\nthat dopamine is critical for overcoming procrastination,\\n\\nfor ensuring ongoing motivation,\\n\\nand, indeed, for ensuring confidence.\\n\\nIn fact, we are going to talk about the relationship\\n\\nbetween dopamine and motivation and confidence\\n\\nat the level of neurobiological circuitry,\\n\\nand we are going to cover tools\\n\\nthat will allow you to leverage your dopamine\\n\\nin order to have maximum motivation\\n\\nto overcome sticking points,\\n\\nwhich include things like procrastination,\\n\\nbut also by understanding the neural circuits\\n\\nin the brain and body that release and use dopamine,\\n\\nbut more importantly,\\n\\nby understanding what are called dopamine dynamics.\\n\\nThat is, what gives rise to big peaks in dopamine\\n\\nor troughs in dopamine,\\n\\nor what's referred to as our baseline level of dopamine,\\n\\nwhich turns out to be our baseline levels of motivation\\n\\nand feelings of wellbeing.\\n\\nBy understanding how those things relate to one another,\\n\\nI assure you that by the end of today's episode,\\n\\nyou will be in a far better position\\n\\nto understand why you become amotivated,\\n\\nwhy you procrastinate,\\n\\nhow to ensure motivation on an ongoing basis,\\n\\nand even how to leverage effort\\n\\nand the desire to become motivated\\n\\nas a way to do just that, to become more motivated.\\n\\nToday's discussion is not about psychology,\\n\\nalthough I will center around practical everyday examples\\n\\nand offer many, many tools\\n\\nthat you can implement if you choose.\\n\\nToday's discussion is really about pulling apart\\n\\nthese things that we call motivation, reward,\\n\\npleasure, procrastination,\\n\\nand understanding them in terms of their dopamine dynamics.\\n\\nSo whether you've heard me or others\\n\\ntalk about dopamine before,\\n\\nor whether or not today is your first exposure\\n\\nto the topic of dopamine,\\n\\ntoday's episode is really designed to give you\\n\\nthe biological and practical knowledge\\n\\nso that you can leverage your dopamine circuitry\\n\\nand your dopamine levels,\\n\\nas well as tools to adjust dopamine circuitry and levels\\n\\nin order to optimize mental health,\\n\\nphysical health, and performance.\\n\\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast\\n\\nis separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.\\n\\nIt is, however, part of my desire and effort\\n\\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\\n\\nabout science and science-related tools\\n\\nto the general public.\\n\\nIn keeping with that theme,\\n\\nI'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.\\n\\nOur first sponsor is Helix Sleep.\\n\\nHelix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows\\n\\nthat are the absolute highest quality.\\n\\nI've talked many times before on this and other podcasts\\n\\nabout the critical role that sleep plays\\n\\nin allowing you to be awake and alert\\n\\nand have a good elevated mood throughout the day.\\n\\nSleep is just fundamental to our mental health,\\n\\nphysical health, and performance,\\n\\nand there's no replacing great sleep.\\n\\nA key thing we all need in order to get excellent sleep\\n\\nis to have an ideal sleep environment.\\n\\nHelix mattresses are designed for your unique sleep needs\\n\\nin order to ensure that you get\\n\\nthe best possible night's sleep.\\n\\nSo if you go to the Helix site\\n\\nand you take their very brief two or three minute quiz,\\n\\nit will ask you questions such as,\\n\\ndo you sleep on your side, your back, or your stomach?\\n\\nDo you tend to run hot or cold throughout the night?\\n\\nAnd they will match you to a mattress\\n\\nthat's specific to your sleep needs.\\n\\nI matched to the dusk mattress.\\n\\nThat's the one that works for me.\\n\\nAnd since sleeping on the dusk mattress\\n\\nnow for well over two years,\\n\\nI've been sleeping better than I ever have before.\\n\\nSo if you go to their site, you take the quiz\\n\\nand you figure out what's the ideal mattress for you.\\n\\nJust go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,\\n\\ntake their two minute sleep quiz,\\n\\nand they'll match you to a customized mattress.\\n\\nAnd you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order\\n\\nand two free pillows.\\n\\nAgain, if interested, you can go to helixsleep.com\\n\\nslash Huberman for up to $350 off and two free pillows.\\n\\nToday's episode is also brought to us by Whoop.\\n\\nWhoop is a fitness wearable device\\n\\nthat tracks your daily activity and sleep,\\n\\nbut also goes beyond that by providing real-time feedback\\n\\non how to adjust your physical training and sleep schedule\\n\\nand other activities throughout your day\\n\\nin order to optimize your health.\\n\\nI've been working with Whoop\\n\\non their scientific advisory council\\n\\nto help advance Whoop's technology and mission\\n\\nof unlocking human performance,\\n\\nnot just for athletes, but for everybody.\\n\\nAs a Whoop user, I've experienced the health benefits\\n\\nof their technology firsthand.\\n\\nFor instance, it tells me, of course,\\n\\nwhether or not I had a good night's sleep\\n\\nor a poor night's sleep by giving me a sleep score.\\n\\nIt tells me the percentage of rapid eye movement sleep\\n\\nto slow wave sleep.\\n\\nBut Whoop also tells me, for instance,\\n\\nwhether or not certain activities during my daytime,\\n\\nsuch as naps or training or training\\n\\nof a certain amount of intensity,\\n\\nhow that's impacting my sleep and vice versa.\\n\\nIf you're interested in trying Whoop,\\n\\nyou can go to join.whoop.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nAgain, that join.whoop.com slash Huberman today,\\n\\nand you'll get your first month free.\\n\\nToday's episode is also brought to us by Roca.\\n\\nRoca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\\n\\nthat are uniquely tailored to the needs of athletes\\n\\nand everyday people.\\n\\nThe company was founded by two all-American swimmers\\n\\nfrom Stanford, and everything about Roca eyeglasses\\n\\nand sunglasses were designed with the biology,\\n\\nthe visual system in mind.\\n\\nI've spent a lifetime working on the biology,\\n\\nthe visual system, and I can tell you\\n\\nthat your visual system has to contend\\n\\nwith enormous number of challenges\\n\\nin order for you to be able to see clearly.\\n\\nRoca eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed\\n\\nsuch that when you go from one environment to the next,\\n\\nlike a brightly lit environment,\\n\\nto a less brightly lit environment,\\n\\nyou don't notice that transition.\\n\\nYou always see with perfect clarity.\\n\\nAnother terrific thing about Roca eyeglasses\\n\\nand sunglasses is that many of the performance glasses\\n\\nout there that are designed for sport\\n\\nmake people look like cyborgs,\\n\\nwhich if you want that, they do have those options,\\n\\nthe cyborg options, as I call them,\\n\\nbut they also have many options\\n\\nwhere the aesthetic is more of the sort\\n\\nthat you would wear to dinner or to work\\n\\nor anywhere that you happen to be.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,\\n\\ngo to roca, that's R-O-K-A.com,\\n\\nand enter

Momentous Supplements.\\n\\nTo find the supplements we discussed\\n\\non the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\n\\nyou can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,\\n\\nlivemomentous.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nAnd I should just mention that the library\\n\\nof those supplements is constantly expanding.\\n\\nAgain, that's livemomentous.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nOkay, let's talk about dopamine.\\n\\nWhat is dopamine?\\n\\nDopamine is what's called a neuromodulator,\\n\\nwhich simply refers to the fact that it's a chemical\\n\\nthat modulates or changes the electrical activity\\n\\nof other cells.\\n\\nAnd the cells I'm referring to are neurons.\\n\\nNeurons are just nerve cells.\\n\\nSo you have a brain and a spinal cord,\\n\\nand the neurons in your brain and spinal cord\\n\\nconnect to one another,\\n\\nand they connect to different areas of the body,\\n\\nincluding basically every organ of your body.\\n\\nAnd every organ of your body communicates back\\n\\nto your brain and spinal cord\\n\\nthrough direct or indirect pathways.\\n\\nFor instance, you have neurons in your gut\\n\\nthat sense what sorts of nutrients you've eaten or drank,\\n\\nand then send neural signals, electrical signals,\\n\\nup to the brain.\\n\\nAnd indeed, that whole process happens\\n\\nto be modulated by dopamine.\\n\\nDopamine as a neuromodulator has the basic property\\n\\nof either ramping up, increasing,\\n\\nor decreasing the activity of other neurons.\\n\\nAnd that's done by adjusting things\\n\\nlike electrical potentials and things of that sort\\n\\nthat we really won't go into this episode,\\n\\nbut that I promise to get into in detail\\n\\nin a future episode if you're interested\\n\\nin the biochemistry and biophysics of neurons\\n\\nand things of that sort.\\n\\nSo we have this neuromodulator, dopamine,\\n\\nand we know that that neuromodulator can increase\\n\\nor decrease the activity of other neurons.\\n\\nSo then we have to ask ourselves,\\n\\nwhere is dopamine released in the brain and body,\\n\\nand what specific types of neurons is it impacting?\\n\\nIn other words, what specific types of functions\\n\\ndoes dopamine have?\\n\\nSo there are basically five circuits within the brain\\n\\nthat use dopamine as the primary neuromodulator,\\n\\nand those five circuits engage different\\n\\nbut related functions.\\n\\nSo I'm gonna go through them one by one relatively quickly,\\n\\ngiving you a little bit of nomenclature\\n\\nand some sense of what each of those circuits looks like\\n\\nand what it does.\\n\\nThe first circuit is the so-called nigrostriatal pathway.\\n\\nSo in the back of the brain,\\n\\nthere's an area called substantia nigra,\\n\\nso named because the neurons, they are actually very dark,\\n\\nthey actually contain pigment.\\n\\nYou'd be able to see this if I were to slice up a brain,\\n\\nyou'd see two dark regions in the back.\\n\\nThat's substantia nigra.\\n\\nSubstantia nigra contains neurons\\n\\nthat are chock-a-block full of dopamine,\\n\\nbut they release that dopamine\\n\\nin a brain structure called the striatum.\\n\\nThe striatum is involved in movement,\\n\\nboth the initiation of movements\\n\\nand the suppression of movements,\\n\\nin so-called go, action,\\n\\nand no-go, suppress action pathways,\\n\\na topic for a future podcast.\\n\\nThe second brain circuit that uses and leverages dopamine\\n\\nto a great extent is the so-called mesolimbic pathway.\\n\\nNow, you'll also in a moment hear\\n\\nabout the mesocortical pathway.\\n\\nSo today I'm gonna talk about these\\n\\nsomewhat interchangeably at times,\\n\\nbut where it's important for me\\n\\nto differentiate between them, I will do that.\\n\\nBoth of these pathways initiate from a set of neurons\\n\\nin the so-called ventral tegmental area, or VTA.\\n\\nI will use that acronym, VTA.\\n\\nThe VTA functions in close partnership\\n\\nwith a different brain structure\\n\\ncalled the nucleus accumbens, or NA.\\n\\nI don't think I'll call it NA today.\\n\\nI'll talk about VTA, ventral tegmental area,\\n\\nand I'll talk about nucleus accumbens.\\n\\nFor sake of today's discussion,\\n\\nyou can lump those together if you want.\\n\\nNeurons in those areas project a bunch of different places,\\n\\nbut in the mesolimbic pathway,\\n\\nthose neurons are projecting to areas of the brain\\n\\nlike the hypothalamus,\\n\\nwhich sits right above the roof of your mouth\\n\\nand is responsible for a lot of basic functions,\\n\\nthings like maintaining your body temperature,\\n\\nfor libido and the pursuit of sex,\\n\\nfor hunger, for the generation of signals\\n\\nto the pituitary gland that caused the release of hormones\\n\\nand other things into the bloodstream.\\n\\nSo the connections,\\n\\nwhich I sometimes refer to as projections,\\n\\nfrom the neurons in the VTA and nucleus accumbens\\n\\nto the hypothalamus are basically using dopamine\\n\\nto modulate the output of a lot of different things\\n\\nthat happen in this hypothalamus\\n\\nthat controls a lot of,\\n\\nwe could call them primitive functions,\\n\\nbut they're really basic functions for survival.\\n\\nNow, the other pathway out of the VTA\\n\\nand nucleus accumbens is to the cortex.\\n\\nThat's why it's called mesocortical pathway.\\n\\nSo this is a very different pathway\\n\\nout of the VTA and nucleus accumbens\\n\\nthan the one I just described a moment ago.\\n\\nThe pathway I'm talking about now,\\n\\nthe mesocortical pathway,\\n\\nprojects to the prefrontal cortex,\\n\\nwhich is a structure that many of you perhaps heard of,\\n\\nbut even if you haven't, it's important to know\\n\\nthis is an area that resides right behind your forehead\\n\\nand that in humans compared to other species\\n\\nis greatly expanded in terms of its size\\n\\nand complexity of function.\\n\\nSo it's involved in everything from planning\\n\\nand executing of action to making good or bad decisions\\n\\ndepending on context.\\n\\nIn fact, one of the primary functions\\n\\nof prefrontal cortex is to really understand context,\\n\\nwhether or not, for instance,\\n\\nyou are alone in your room\\n\\nwhere certain behaviors are appropriate,\\n\\nwhether or not you are at work\\n\\nwhere other behaviors are appropriate,\\n\\nunderstanding what the context is\\n\\nand therefore what sorts of actions\\n\\nneed to be generated and suppressed.\\n\\nIn fact, a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast,\\n\\nand this is a guest whose episode hasn't aired yet,\\n\\ndescribed this beautifully.\\n\\nHe's a neurosurgeon and he said,\\n\\nthe way to think about the prefrontal cortex\\n\\nis it's basically an area of the brain that says shh\\n\\nor no, not now to other brain regions\\n\\nin order to suppress action.\\n\\nAnd we know this because people that have damage\\n\\nto the prefrontal cortex\\n\\noften can't suppress their impulses.\\n\\nAnd so the pathway from VTA and nucleus accumbens\\n\\nto the prefrontal cortex is absolutely critical\\n\\nfor today's discussion because we are largely going\\n\\nto be discussing motivation, drive, pursuit,\\n\\nprocrastination, and all sorts of things\\n\\nthat have to do with our feelings about context,\\n\\nwhether or not we want to do something or not,\\n\\nwhether or not we feel we should or we shouldn't,\\n\\nwhether or not we feel we failed the last time\\n\\nor there's a high probability of success the next time.\\n\\nPrefrontal cortex does many, many things,\\n\\nbut when thinking about dopamine's role\\n\\nin the prefrontal cortex,\\n\\nthat is when thinking about this mesocortical pathway,\\n\\nwe really want to think about how dopamine is activating\\n\\nor changing our propensity to do certain things\\n\\nand get us into action or prevent us\\n\\nfrom doing certain things and prevent action.\\n\\nSo basically you can think about the mesocortical pathway\\n\\nas a circuit that really governs all of the major choices\\n\\nthat you're going to make in life\\n\\nabout what to do and what not to do toward your goals\\n\\nand away from the things that you want to avoid.\\n\\nNow, the fourth dopamine pathway in the brain\\n\\nis the so-called tuberoinfundibular pathway.\\n\\nAnd this is not one we're going to focus on too much today.\\n\\nThis is a pathway that relates to connections\\n\\nbetween the brain and your pituitary gland.\\n\\nYour pituitary gland being that gland that's,\\n\\nas I mentioned a moment ago,\\n\\nis also receiving input from the hypothalamus\\n\\nand is releasing a bunch of hormones into your bloodstream,\\n\\nthings like luteinizing hormone,\\n\\nfollicle stimulating hormone,\\n\\nthings like melanocortin hormone.\\n\\nThese are hormones that are impacting everything\\n\\nfrom the function of the ovary and females\\n\\nto the function of the testes and males.\\n\\nIt's governing things like cortisol release under stress,\\n\\nthyroid hormone,\\n\\nmeaning it's regulating thyroid hormone release,\\n\\nand on and on.\\n\\nDopamine has a very powerful impact\\n\\non the output of the pituitary.\\n\\nSo again, that's probably a topic for a future episode,\\n\\nbut it's important in reviewing the different brain circuits\\n\\nthat use dopamine as a neuromodulator\\n\\nthat I mentioned that one.\\n\\nThen there's a fifth one.\\n\\nAnd this fifth one is not often discussed.\\n\\nAnd again, it won't be the main topic of today's discussion,\\n\\nbut for thoroughness and for clarity,\\n\\nit's important that we mention it.\\n\\nThis is the circuit within your retina,\\n\\nthat is the pie crust-like lining of neural tissue\\n\\non the back of your eye,\\n\\nbecause remember, your eye is actually part of your brain\\n\\nthat got extruded from your brain during development.\\n\\nThose two eyes that you see in the mirror\\n\\nand that you see in other people\\n\\nare actually two pieces of central nervous system.\\n\\nAnd within the retina,\\n\\nwhich is the neural portion of the eye,\\n\\nwithin the neural retina,\\n\\ndopamine is responsible for adapting\\n\\nto different light conditions\\n\\nso that you can see clearly both in the evening\\n\\nand when it gets darker, you can still see a bit.\\n\\nAnd in the morning, when it's very bright,\\n\\nyou don't really have to make adjustments\\n\\nto your visual system in order to see clearly.\\n\\nYour visual system does it for you.\\n\\nAnd one of the ways that it does that\\n\\nis through the neuromodulator dopamine.\\n\\nSo today we are not going to discuss\\n\\nthe retinal dopamine pathways\\n\\nor the tuberoinfraindibular dopamine pathways.\\n\\nAnd we won't really talk so much\\n\\nabout the nigrostriatal pathway.\\n\\nI'll say one more thing about it\\n\\nand then I'll leave it alone.\\n\\nWe are going to talk about the mesocortical pathway.\\n\\nAnd we might touch on the mesolimbic pathway\\n\\na little bit as well.\\n\\nSo today we're mostly going to talk\\n\\nabout mesocortical circuitry and function\\n\\nand dopamine within the mesocortical circuit.\\n\\nAnd the reason that we're doing that\\n\\nis that today's discussion is really about motivation,\\n\\nprocrastination, goal setting and pursuit.\\n\\nIt's very important to understand\\n\\nthat neither dopamine nor the mesocortical circuit\\n\\ncares about any specific goal or pursuit.\\n\\nThis is a circuit that uses dopamine\\n\\nin order to pursue anything.\\n\\nNow, of course, some people have a greater propensity\\n\\nto pursue things like work or goals in athletics\\n\\nor relationships or a combination of those.\\n\\nOther people, unfortunately, have a greater propensity\\n\\nto pursue things like drugs of abuse.\\n\\nWhat are drugs of abuse?\\n\\nDrugs of abuse tend to be drugs\\n\\nthat increase levels of dopamine\\n\\nto the extent that other types of pursuits in life\\n\\nthat are adaptive for us,\\n\\nlike work, relationship, school, et cetera,\\n\\nbecome irrelevant.\\n\\nIn fact, the definition of addiction that I use\\n\\nand that I believe really matches\\n\\nthe neurobiology very well\\n\\nis that addiction is a progressive narrowing\\n\\nof the things that bring us pleasure.\\n\\nHealthy functioning of the mesocortical pathway, however,\\n\\nallows us to toggle or switch back and forth\\n\\nbetween different types of pursuits\\n\\nof all the sorts that I've mentioned earlier.\\n\\nSo if we can understand\\n\\nhow that mesocortical pathway works just a little bit,\\n\\nin particular, when dopamine is released\\n\\nand when it's not released,\\n\\nwhat dopamine does when it's released\\n\\nto our sense of motivation and drive,\\n\\nand if we can understand a little bit\\n\\nabout how our recent dopamine history,\\n\\nthat is, whether or not there is dopamine\\n\\nin our system already,\\n\\ndictates whether or not we are going to feel motivated\\n\\nin the next five, 10, 15 minutes, hours, days, and weeks.\\n\\nThat is all very easy to understand.\\n\\nI promise I'll explain it to you in a simple way,\\n\\nbut I want you to get a circuit into your mind.\\n\\nI want you to envision that there are these neurons,\\n\\nlittle nerve cells in the VTA and nucleus accumbens.\\n\\nThose neurons make dopamine.\\n\\nThey send their projections that we call axons,\\n\\nwhich are like little wires,\\n\\nand they can release dopamine into the prefrontal cortex.\\n\\nAnd now you already know,\\n\\nbecause you learned it a few minutes ago,\\n\\nthat the prefrontal cortex then can ensure\\n\\nthat certain behaviors take place\\n\\nand other behaviors do not take place,\\n\\nthat shh or quieting that we talked about earlier.\\n\\nWith that in mind,\\n\\nlet's now take a look at how dopamine is released.\\n\\nAnd let's keep two things in mind.\\n\\nThere are peaks in dopamine.\\n\\nThat is dopamine is released into the frontal cortex,\\n\\nwhere it has these effects of activating\\n\\nor suppressing action.\\n\\nAnd we can think of those as peaks in dopamine.\\n\\nSo if I call it a spike,\\n\\nthat means an increase and then a decrease.\\n\\nIf I call it a peak, it's an increase and then a decrease.\\n\\nThere can also be troughs in dopamine.\\n\\nWhat do I mean by that?\\n\\nWell, we have peaks in dopamine\\n\\nand that peak in dopamine can rise up\\n\\nand then go back to what we call baseline,\\n\\nor there can be a trough.\\n\\nIt can go below baseline.\\n\\nSo the two key things to understand about dopamine\\n\\nis that we have dopamine peaks\\n\\nthat are triggered by certain behaviors,\\n\\ncertain compounds, drugs, or substances, food, et cetera,\\n\\nand that we have a dopamine baseline.\\n\\nOur dopamine baseline is our reservoir of dopamine.\\n\\nIt's how full or empty our dopamine pool is.\\n\\nAnd that dopamine pool is the pool of dopamine that we use\\n\\nin order to create those dopamine peaks.\\n\\nAnd when those peaks come down,\\n\\nsometimes they go back to baseline\\n\\nand sometimes they go to lower than baseline,\\n\\nwhich we call the trough.\\n\\nIf any of this seems confusing,\\n\\nI want you just to imagine a wave pool.\\n\\nThis is an analogy that was given to me\\n\\nby one of our podcast guests,\\n\\nwhich is Dr. Kyle Gillette, who's an obesity specialist\\n\\nand works on a number of things\\n\\nrelated to endocrine hormone function,\\n\\nincluding testosterone, estrogen, in both men and women.\\n\\nWant to check out his episodes on hormone health.\\n\\nThey're fascinating and actionable.\\n\\nHe's a tremendous wealth of knowledge.\\n\\nAnd he has this analogy for how dopamine works\\n\\nin our brain and body.\\n\\nAnd that analogy is this notion of a wave pool.\\n\\nIf you've ever seen a wave pool,\\n\\nit's basically a concrete pool\\n\\nand there are waves within it, okay, duh.\\n\\nThose waves can be of different heights.\\n\\nSo they can be little ripples.\\n\\nAnd we can think of those as little mini peaks\\n\\nor they can be big waves.\\n\\nThey can be really big crashing waves.\\n\\nIf the height of those waves\\n\\nand the frequency of those waves is very, very large,\\n\\nsome of that water,\\n\\nwhich here I'm using as an analogy to dopamine,\\n\\ncan slosh out of the wave pool and the baseline drops.\\n\\nHowever, if those peaks are small enough\\n\\nor they are seldom enough, well, then the baseline,\\n\\nthat is the water level in that pool\\n\\nstays more or less constant.\\n\\nI think this is an excellent analogy for how dopamine works\\n\\nin the mesocortical pathway as it relates to motivation\\n\\nand pursuit and all those sorts of things,\\n\\nbecause we really need to think about how the peaks\\n\\nand the baseline relate to one another.\\n\\nAnd this is very important.\\n\\nThe peaks and the baseline are not independent\\n\\nof one another, they relate to one another.\\n\\nSo now you have in your mind a wave pool\\n\\nand just understand that if you get a great big, huge wave,\\n\\nmaybe one of them will crash out\\n\\nand some of that water will splash out,\\n\\nthe baseline will go down a little bit.\\n\\nBut if you get big peak after big peak after big peak,\\n\\npretty soon you're going to empty that pool.\\n\\nWhereas if you have smaller waves\\n\\nor less frequent big waves,\\n\\nwell, then the baseline will stay relatively constant.\\n\\nSo let's think about dopamine peaks and baselines.\\n\\nAnd let's remember that for every peak, there's a trough.\\n\\nWhat do I mean by that?\\n\\nWell, when you have a wave,\\n\\nyou also have the bottom of the wave.\\n\\nWhen you have a mountain, you have the bottom\\n\\nof the mountain.\\n\\nWhen we think about dopamine peaks and dopamine baselines,\\n\\nwe have to include that trough because that trough,\\n\\nthat is the level of dopamine below baseline,\\n\\nreally dictates whether or not you are going\\n\\nto feel motivated to pursue something or not.\\n\\nSo I'm going to give you a visual in your mind.\\n\\nThe visual in your mind is an increase in dopamine\\n\\nthat's triggered by your desire for something\\n\\nand really could be your desire for anything.\\n\\nIf you're hungry and you're thinking about,\\n\\nI really want a sandwich.\\n\\nI really want to think what sandwich would I want right now?\\n\\nA really nice roast beef sandwich on sourdough\\n\\nwith a slice of Swiss tomatoes, a slice of pickle.\\n\\nHere I'm describing the sandwich that I would want.\\n\\nSo if you're hungry and you're thinking about that,\\n\\ndopamine starts rising.\\n\\nThis is crucially important to understand.\\n\\nDopamine is not just released when we get the reward,\\n\\nwhen we get the thing that we're pursuing.\\n\\nDopamine is released in anticipation of what we want.\\n\\nThat increase in dopamine is by no happenstance,\\n\\nno mistake relates also to our propensity\\n\\nand desire to move.\\n\\nRemember earlier I told you there's a separate circuit\\n\\nof dopamine that triggers movement\\n\\nand that when it's depleted is causing things\\n\\nlike deficits in movement related to Parkinson's\\n\\nor other movement disorders.\\n\\nWell, that's not pure coincidence.\\n\\nThat's because desire and the need to move\\n\\nin order to pursue and reach goals\\n\\nare one in the same process.\\n\\nSo if I desire a sandwich or I desire a cup of coffee\\n\\nor I desire some water when I'm thirsty,\\n\\nthere's an increase in dopamine\\n\\nthat we could call a little mini peak in dopamine.\\n\\nBut then here's the key thing.\\n\\nVery soon after I realized my desire for something,\\n\\nthat peak that was caused by the desire comes down\\n\\nand drops below baseline, below the level of dopamine\\n\\nthat it was prior to even thinking about the sandwich\\n\\nor the coffee or the glass of water.\\n\\nAnd it's that drop below baseline\\n\\nthat triggers my desire to go out and find that sandwich,\\n\\nthat coffee, that water, or that blank,\\n\\ninsert whatever it is that you happen to desire,\\n\\naction or substance of any kind or person, et cetera.\\n\\nSo that drop below baseline is fundamental\\n\\nto the whole process.\\n\\nAnd that drop below baseline was triggered\\n\\nby the preceding peak.\\n\\nSo let's say that I desire a sandwich,\\n\\nthere's an increase in dopamine,\\n\\nthen very quickly it comes down below baseline\\n\\njust a little bit.\\n\\nNow I'm in pursuit of the sandwich.\\n\\nI'm looking for where I can get that sandwich.\\n\\nI can order it perhaps to be delivered.\\n\\nI can go out and find it.\\n\\nNow is the stage in which I have to think about\\n\\nwhat are the different stimuli,\\n\\nthat is the things in my environment\\n\\nthat signal whether or not I'm likely\\n\\nto get that sandwich or not.\\n\\nAnd so for instance, if I were to go into my phone\\n\\nand order food on a nap or walk down the street\\n\\nand see the sign for a deli,\\n\\nthat's a cue that I'm likely to relieve that drop\\n\\nin dopamine and get not just back to baseline,\\n\\nbut that I'll get a peak in dopamine.\\n\\nAnd indeed, that's what happens\\n\\nif I find that deli, I go into the deli, they're open,\\n\\nthey're making the sandwich that I want,\\n\\nthey make my sandwich and great, I get that sandwich.\\n\\nAnd that sandwich will have some degree\\n\\nof inherent reward to it,\\n\\nsome degree of my liking it or not liking it.\\n\\nSo let's say I like it.\\n\\nIt's not the best sandwich I've ever had,\\n\\nbut all I'm doing is comparing my desire for that sandwich\\n\\nto the sandwich that I actually got and ate.\\n\\nAnd chances are it's going to relieve that craving,\\n\\nmeaning it will take that dopamine\\n\\nthat had fallen below baseline, up, up, back to baseline.\\n\\nAnd if I like the sandwich,\\n\\nit's going to indeed increase that dopamine,\\n\\nagain, to another peak.\\n\\nNow, if I love the sandwich,\\n\\nlike it's the most delicious thing\\n\\nthat I've ever tasted in my entire life,\\n\\nwell, then I'll get a big peak in dopamine\\n\\nwhen I consume that reward.\\n\\nHowever, chances are that the sandwich\\n\\nis more or less as I expect it to be, which is pretty good.\\n\\nI'll eat it and I'm fine.\\n\\nWhat do I mean by fine?\\n\\nWell, there's a concept called reward prediction error.\\n\\nReward prediction error says that the dopamine\\n\\nthat it has experienced, that is,\\n\\nthat's released from the VTA and nucleus accumbens,\\n\\nis going to be of a certain value.\\n\\nAnd that value is going to be compared\\n\\nto the desire and expectation\\n\\nof what I thought I was going to get.\\n\\nSo if you take what you actually got\\n\\nminus what you expected, that's reward prediction error.\\n\\nSo if the sandwich is basically what I expected to get,\\n\\nfine, dopamine comes down,\\n\\nbasically to a baseline level\\n\\nthat's pretty standard for me\\n\\nand is basically the baseline level I had\\n\\nbefore I ever thought about the sandwich at all.\\n\\nIf the sandwich completely surprises me\\n\\nand is completely amazing, just an amazing sandwich,\\n\\nwell, then the level of dopamine that I experienced\\n\\nwhen I consume that sandwich is going to be even greater,\\n\\nand it's going to be that minus what I expected.\\n\\nSo there, it's a bigger reward prediction error\\n\\nin the direction of higher peak by consuming the sandwich.\\n\\nAnd then of course, there's the other possibility,\\n\\nwhich is the deli's closed,\\n\\nor the sandwich they make me is lousy\\n\\nor it doesn't taste good,\\n\\nor something happened in the consuming of that sandwich\\n\\nthat just makes it a bad experience.\\n\\nIn which case, if we take that reward experienced\\n\\nminus reward predicted from the initial craving,\\n\\nwell, then it's going to be less than what I expected,\\n\\nand therefore the baseline drops below\\n\\nwhere it was prior to even desiring the sandwich.\\n\\nSo all of this might seem a little bit complicated,\\n\\nbut it's all very simple.\\n\\nDesire for things increases dopamine,\\n\\nbut then our level of dopamine drops below baseline,\\n\\nand it's that drop below baseline\\n\\nthat triggers the motivation\\n\\nto bring that dopamine level back up\\n\\nby going and pursuing the thing\\n\\nthat you wanted in the first place.\\n\\nNow, of course, as this is happening,\\n\\nyou're not conscious of your dopamine levels.\\n\\nYou experience this as context dependent craving\\n\\nand pursuit, because remember,\\n\\nthe prefrontal cortex is involved in context setting\\n\\nand craving and pursuit,\\n\\nbecause it relates to action and movement,\\n\\nwhich is one of the general features of the dopamine system.\\n\\nSo you can start to see\\n\\nhow this is a beautifully designed system,\\n\\nand you can also see how it's a perfect system\\n\\nfor desire and pursuit of anything,\\n\\nnot just sandwiches, as I'm giving you in this\\n\\nsomewhat trivial, but everyday\\n\\nand therefore applicable example.\\n\\nSo just by understanding reward prediction error,\\n\\nand especially by understanding\\n\\nthat a craving triggers a peak in dopamine\\n\\nthat makes you motivated,\\n\\nbut then drops your level of dopamine below baseline,\\n\\nwhich makes you even more motivated,\\n\\nyou are already halfway through the conceptual aspect\\n\\nof today's podcast, because if you can understand that,\\n\\nyou will understand why, for instance,\\n\\nwhen you initially want something\\n\\nor you think you want something,\\n\\nit puts you into motion, but then pretty quickly,\\n\\nyou're starting to feel the pain of not having that,\\n\\nand that is also contributing\\n\\nto your desire to pursue that thing.\\n\\nThis is a subtle effect, but if you watch for it,\\n\\nyou'll start to see it or experience it within yourself.\\n\\nYour craving for things is not just about craving\\n\\nfor those things per se,\\n\\nit's also a desire to relieve the pain\\n\\nof not having those things.\\n\\nAnd if you can internalize that\\n\\nand start to develop an awareness around it,\\n\\nyou will be in an amazing position\\n\\nto leverage all sorts of aspects of the dopamine system\\n\\nin order to increase your motivation,\\n\\nespecially when things get really hard\\n\\nor when you have the propensity to procrastinate,\\n\\nwhich is something that we'll get into\\n\\na little bit later in the podcast.\\n\\nI'd like to take a quick break\\n\\nand acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.\\n\\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1,\\n\\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\\n\\nthat covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.\\n\\nI've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,\\n\\nso I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.\\n\\nThe

D3K2.\\n\\nNow I'd like to talk about the dynamics of dopamine release\\n\\nwith a little bit more detail.\\n\\nAnd this is something I've never covered\\n\\non any social media post or on any podcast,\\n\\neither this one or as a guest on other podcasts,\\n\\nbecause on the face of it,\\n\\nit might seem a little too detailed.\\n\\nLike, why is he telling me all this?\\n\\nIsn't it just enough to know that there are peaks and troughs\\n\\nand baselines in dopamine?\\n\\nWell, it turns out that if you can understand\\n\\nwhat that peak and trough are really about,\\n\\nin other words, what's really happening\\n\\nwhen we zoom in on that peak and trough,\\n\\nyou'll be in an amazing position to overcome procrastination\\n\\nand essentially pursue any goals in an ongoing basis.\\n\\nSo I'm very excited to share this information with you\\n\\nbecause I do think that it has tremendous actionable power.\\n\\nWhat I'm about to describe relates to a number\\n\\nof different findings that have been made,\\n\\nmostly over the last five to 10 years,\\n\\nalthough to be quite direct,\\n\\nmostly within the last five years.\\n\\nAnd it has to do with the fact that the peak and trough\\n\\nand baseline that I talked about a moment ago\\n\\nthat are associated with craving,\\n\\nthey look like a peak followed by a trough,\\n\\nfollowed by a return to baseline and maybe another peak\\n\\nif you get the reward or a drop below baseline if you don't\\n\\nor you don't like what you got.\\n\\nBut if we were to zoom in on that peak and the reward,\\n\\nin other words, to really zoom in on the whole process\\n\\nand start thinking about the circuitry,\\n\\nthat is the neurons in VTA and nucleus accumbens\\n\\nand how it relates to the frontal cortex\\n\\nin a bit more detail,\\n\\nwhat we discover is nothing short of amazing.\\n\\nWhat we discover is that whenever we're pursuing something,\\n\\nwe are always looking for cues as to whether or not\\n\\nwe are on the right path to achieve that thing.\\n\\nAnd we are also setting a mindset or a context\\n\\nwithin our brains as to whether or not we are confident\\n\\nor pessimistic as to whether or not\\n\\nwe're going to achieve that thing.\\n\\nNow, this is vitally important for anyone out there\\n\\nwho finds it hard to get motivated and stay motivated.\\n\\nIt's also vitally important for anyone\\n\\nwho's psychologically minded in any way.\\n\\nYou don't have to be a psychologist,\\n\\nbut psychologically minded in any way and wonders,\\n\\nwhy is it that some people are just so motivated\\n\\nand other people have such trouble with motivation?\\n\\nWhy is it that some people require perfect conditions\\n\\nin order to achieve things?\\n\\nAnd other people just seem to manage to pursue things\\n\\nno matter what.\\n\\nIt also relates to the fact that some of us\\n\\nare very good at achieving our goals in one context\\n\\nand not so much in another.\\n\\nSo here's what you need to understand.\\n\\nI'll stay with the example of the roast beef sandwich\\n\\njust because we already have that in mind,\\n\\nbut you can replace roast beef sandwich\\n\\nwith essentially any goal.\\n\\nThe cue that we're going to likely get what we want.\\n\\nSo for instance, the sign that there's a deli on the corner\\n\\nor that I open my phone and that there's an app\\n\\nthat represents a restaurant that sells\\n\\nthe particular sandwich that I like.\\n\\nThat cue, as I mentioned before, increases dopamine.\\n\\nYou see that and like, oh, okay.\\n\\nAnd subconsciously, there's already a signal\\n\\nthat's initiated by that dopamine\\n\\nthat I'm on the right path.\\n\\nThen as I mentioned, dopamine drops below baseline.\\n\\nThat's further contributing to my desire\\n\\nto go pursue that sandwich,\\n\\neither with my thumbs on my phone through the app\\n\\nor with my feet and walking to the deli,\\n\\nstanding in line and so forth.\\n\\nThen as I mentioned before, there is a peak in dopamine\\n\\nof varying height, depending on how satisfying\\n\\nI find the reward to be,\\n\\nwhen I actually get that sandwich, get that goal.\\n\\nNow keep in mind, there is some time delay between the cue,\\n\\nthe app, the deli, et cetera, and when I get my sandwich.\\n\\nThat gap is going to be different for different things.\\n\\nSo in pursuing a four-year degree,\\n\\nit's going to be four years if the diploma is your goal.\\n\\nIf it's an exam you're studying for,\\n\\nit might be a week long.\\n\\nAnd there will be many other signals\\n\\nin between that initial cue that,\\n\\nhey, the reward likely lies down this path,\\n\\nin this textbook, on this dating app or at that deli.\\n\\nThere are many other cues.\\n\\nThose cues come in subconsciously and involve everything\\n\\nfrom how long the line is at the deli\\n\\nto whether or not you're seeing the types of people\\n\\non a dating app that you'd like to see,\\n\\nwhether or not they're responding to you,\\n\\nwhether or not someone's texting you back or not.\\n\\nAll of those cues are integrated\\n\\nand adjusting your baseline level of dopamine all the time\\n\\nas you go to pursue that goal.\\n\\nSo what the dopamine system does is it doesn't just compare\\n\\nthe height of the peak at the beginning, right?\\n\\nI desire that to the reward that you got.\\n\\nWe talked about reward prediction error.\\n\\nThat's the kind of first grade version\\n\\nof reward prediction error.\\n\\nIt's also taking into account all the things\\n\\nthat happen in between.\\n\\nAnd all of that is serving as a cue for the eventual reward.\\n\\nAnd all of that is funneling\\n\\ninto what we call reward prediction error.\\n\\nIn other words, the dopamine system is very good\\n\\nat subconsciously parsing what are the things that happen\\n\\nbetween wanting and getting.\\n\\nAnd that's part of the learning that dopamine achieves.\\n\\nAnd indeed, there are specialized circuits\\n\\nfrom the VTA and nucleus accumbens\\n\\nthat are involved in just the learning\\n\\nof how we achieve or don't achieve specific types\\n\\nof rewards that we desire.\\n\\nSo this is called reward contingent learning\\n\\nbecause it's learning the contingencies\\n\\nof what led up to a reward\\n\\nor what didn't lead up to a reward.\\n\\nAt the same time and in parallel,\\n\\nthere's an ongoing release of dopamine in the background.\\n\\nAnd that ongoing release of dopamine\\n\\nthat has nothing to do with learning\\n\\nis really just sort of a propeller\\n\\nthat's driving us in the direction\\n\\nof whatever it is that we're trying to pursue.\\n\\nSo I realize for some of you,\\n\\nthis might seem like unnecessary\\n\\nor perhaps even an overwhelming amount of detail,\\n\\nbut it's actually quite simple.\\n\\nYour brain is trying to figure out what happened prior\\n\\nto getting or not getting a reward.\\n\\nAnd it's comparing what you wanted compared to what you got.\\n\\nAt the same time, the dopamine system initiates\\n\\na motivation signal that takes you\\n\\nthrough that entire round of pursuit.\\n\\nAnd those three things, there's the stimulus,\\n\\nthe desire, the, I want that.\\n\\nThat's the first thing that leads to that peak.\\n\\nThe peak drops a little bit below baseline\\n\\nand it triggers motivation.\\n\\nThe motivation is the second thing.\\n\\nThe motivation is dopamine release also,\\n\\nbut from a separate set of neurons within this circuit,\\n\\ndriving you forward.\\n\\nAnd the entire time that it's driving you forward,\\n\\nit's paying attention to what's there along the way,\\n\\neven if you don't realize it consciously.\\n\\nAnd then there's the reward itself\\n\\nor the lack of reward itself.\\n\\nSo those three components, the learning contingency,\\n\\nwhich has to do with the stimulus and the reward\\n\\nand everything that happens in between\\n\\nand the propeller nature of dopamine as I'm referring to it,\\n\\nthose all combine into a total learning\\n\\nso that after you get the sandwich\\n\\nor after you finish the exam or after you go out on a date\\n\\nor after you do anything that you desire to do,\\n\\nthat system that originates in the VTA\\n\\nand nucleus accumbens and goes up to your cortex,\\n\\nit learned.\\n\\nIt learned many things.\\n\\nIt learned the contingency between stimulus\\n\\nand desire or motivation\\n\\nand whether or not you succeeded or not.\\n\\nIt's basically a scoreboard for how you did\\n\\ngiven what just happened.\\n\\nSo actually it's all very simple.\\n\\nIn fact, if you can understand even just half\\n\\nof what I just said,\\n\\nyou are now in a far better position\\n\\nto understand everything from addiction to motivation\\n\\nto procrastination.\\n\\nAnd it will make sense of all the tools\\n\\nthat I'm going to talk about next,\\n\\nwhich will allow you to overcome procrastination points,\\n\\nto overcome deficits and motivation\\n\\nand indeed to reset your motivation in an ongoing way\\n\\nso that you can reach your goals.\\n\\nOkay, so let's take everything that I just told you\\n\\nand set it aside.\\n\\nIt's still important, but let's just set it aside.\\n\\nYou don't have to think about any of those details\\n\\nor names or anything.\\n\\nLet's just think about addiction\\n\\nbecause in biology and in psychology, frankly,\\n\\nit really often pays to think about the extremes first\\n\\nand then work our way towards more typical circumstances.\\n\\nAnd with that said,\\n\\naddiction unfortunately is very common nowadays.\\n\\nI just heard a statistic in fact,\\n\\nthat there is an 80% increase\\n\\nin alcohol use disorder among women in the last 30 years.\\n\\nI talked a little bit about this\\n\\nin the episode that I did about alcohol and health.\\n\\nAgain, I want to be very clear.\\n\\nI'm not somebody that is completely against alcohol\\n\\nfor adults, provided they're not alcoholics.\\n\\nTurns out two drinks a week, probably fine health-wise.\\n\\nZero would be better.\\n\\nIf we're honest, zero is better than any alcohol,\\n\\nbut two drinks a week is probably fine.\\n\\nPast two drinks, you start running into problems.\\n\\nAnd yet many, many people out there,\\n\\nmale and female alike,\\n\\nsuffer from alcohol use disorder, also called alcoholism.\\n\\nThe same is also true for things like methamphetamine\\n\\nor cocaine or other types of substance addictions.\\n\\nAnd the same is also true for a lot of behavioral\\n\\nor what are sometimes called process addictions,\\n\\nthings like sex addiction or video game addiction\\n\\nor any type of behavior\\n\\nthat frankly is leveraging the dopamine system,\\n\\nbut that engages this progressive narrowing\\n\\nof the things that bring someone pleasure,\\n\\nsuch that nothing else is really salient.\\n\\nNothing else is really pulling them in\\n\\nin the way that their video games\\n\\nor sex or pornography or alcohol,\\n\\npick your substance or behavior that you see out there\\n\\nor hopefully not, but that you might suffer\\n\\nfrom an addiction too.\\n\\nSo what's happening in addiction?\\n\\nWell, addiction involves dopamine,\\n\\namong other things often, the opioid system, et cetera.\\n\\nBut if we were to think about what's the stimulus\\n\\nin an addiction and what's the peak in dopamine,\\n\\nand then what happens after that peak,\\n\\nit all becomes very clear as to why addiction happens\\n\\nand why it's so pernicious.\\n\\nSo for instance, let's take cocaine.\\n\\nCocaine causes dramatic increases in dopamine very, very fast.\\n\\nSo if somebody craves cocaine,\\n\\nwhat are they craving?\\n\\nThey're craving that dopamine peak.\\n\\nThey're craving the increased level of alertness.\\n\\nThey're craving a number of things associated\\n\\nwith the feeling of being under the influence of the drug,\\n\\nbut the stimulus for it simply becomes that line of cocaine,\\n\\nor in the case of crack,\\n\\nthat crack rock that they're going to smoke,\\n\\nand God forbid they're mainlining it,\\n\\nthey're shooting into a vein.\\n\\nWhat happens is they snort, smoke or inject cocaine\\n\\nand dopamine levels almost immediately\\n\\ngo up, up, up, up, up, up to a very high peak.\\n\\nOkay, so the time gap between the stimulus\\n\\nand the dopamine is very, very short.\\n\\nSo short in fact, that there's really no other contingencies\\n\\nin between that the mesocortical system has to learn.\\n\\nIn fact, what does the system quote unquote learn?\\n\\nIt learns cocaine equals massive amounts of dopamine,\\n\\nequals feeling euphoric and energetic, et cetera.\\n\\nAnd in doing that, it reinforces the whole circuit\\n\\nso that that short, we can even say hyper short contingency\\n\\nis really what the system wants.\\n\\nSo much so that longer contingencies of say,\\n\\nputting in the hard work of generating a fitness program\\n\\nor a professional program for yourself\\n\\nor a education program, which takes not just many days,\\n\\nbut many weeks and years.\\n\\nWell, none of that is going to lead to peaks in dopamine\\n\\nthat are as high as the peak in dopamine\\n\\nassociated with cocaine.\\n\\nSo that tells us something critical.\\n\\nIt is both the duration between desire and effect.\\n\\nAnd when I say effect, I mean the rewarding properties\\n\\nof dopamine that are experienced, that's important.\\n\\nSo very short gaps teach the system to expect\\n\\nand want short gaps.\\n\\nMakes it very hard to pursue things that take longer.\\n\\nSo when we say it's the short or in this case,\\n\\nhyper short distance or time between the stimulus\\n\\nand the dopamine, what we're really talking about\\n\\nif we were to plot this out on a board\\n\\nor on a piece of paper is the steepness\\n\\nof the rise of that peak.\\n\\nIt's very, very steep.\\n\\nThe peak in dopamine is coming up very fast\\n\\nafter the desire.\\n\\nAnd in addition to that, and this is very important,\\n\\nthe higher the peak in dopamine\\n\\nand the faster the rise to that peak,\\n\\nthe further below baseline,\\n\\nthe dopamine drops after the drug wears off.\\n\\nOkay, so in the case of cocaine,\\n\\nit's a very fast and very large rise in dopamine\\n\\nfollowed by a steep drop\\n\\nand very deep trough in dopamine below baseline.\\n\\nYou say, okay, so there's pleasure,\\n\\nthen there's lack of pleasure.\\n\\nAh, but it's worse than that\\n\\nbecause it's not just lack of pleasure.\\n\\nIf you recall what we talked about a little bit earlier,\\n\\nthat drop below baseline triggers the desire\\n\\nand the pursuit for what?\\n\\nFor more.\\n\\nAnd so this sets in motion a vicious loop\\n\\nwhere people start pursuing peaks in dopamine\\n\\nthat can come very fast without much effort.\\n\\nAnd that's one of the ways\\n\\nin which addiction starts to take hold.\\n\\nThere's a simple way to think about this\\n\\nand to remember if you want to avoid this whole thing.\\n\\nI mean, the first one is obvious.\\n\\nDon't do cocaine, don't try it, don't use it.\\n\\nCertainly don't get addicted to it.\\n\\nThose are all sort of one and the same, frankly.\\n\\nI don't know many people that despite opinions\\n\\nto the contrary that use cocaine recreationally\\n\\nthat don't at some point run into either a financial,\\n\\npsychological, physical, or some other problem.\\n\\nThe other thing that's absolutely critical\\n\\nto keep in mind, and this was discussed in my colleague,\\n\\nDr. Anna Lemke's book, Dopamine Nation,\\n\\nand on this podcast.\\n\\nExcellent book, by the way, I highly recommend it.\\n\\nIf you haven't read it already,\\n\\nit's a fascinating exploration into dopamine\\n\\nas it relates to addiction, not just drug addiction,\\n\\nbut other types of addiction.\\n\\nAgain, the name of that book is Dopamine Nation.\\n\\nWe'll provide a link to it in the show note captions.\\n\\nThe other thing that happens after those big, fast increases\\n\\nin dopamine caused by things like cocaine\\n\\nis afterwards when it quickly drops below baseline,\\n\\nit takes a much longer time to get back\\n\\nto the original baseline than it did prior to using the drug.\\n\\nAnd worse still is that the peaks in dopamine\\n\\nthat are created from more consumption of cocaine\\n\\nleads to progressively lower peaks\\n\\nand deeper troughs below baseline.\\n\\nSo the whole system is shifting away from pleasure\\n\\nand more to pain and the desire for pursuit of the drug.\\n\\nThis is a terrible situation,\\n\\nand it's a terrible situation\\n\\nthat's not just unique to cocaine.\\n\\nIn fact, if we were to look at the averages,\\n\\nand again, these are averages,\\n\\nof the height of the peaks in dopamine\\n\\nthat are created by different substances\\n\\nand the rates at which those peaks take place,\\n\\nbecause remember, the time to peak is just as important\\n\\nas how high that peak goes.\\n\\nWe see some pretty interesting numbers.\\n\\nSo for instance, and again,\\n\\nthese are averages based on neuroimaging\\n\\ncombined with what are called PET scans,\\n\\npositron emission tomography, combined with blood draws\\n\\nand a number of other data\\n\\nfrom both animal and human studies.\\n\\nYou find is that at baseline,\\n\\njust kind of on a background of no drug taking of any kind,\\n\\nthe neurons in the ventricular to mental\\n\\nnucleus accumbens area are firing at a rate\\n\\nof about three to four per second releasing dopamine.\\n\\nSo that's your baseline of dopamine release.\\n\\nYour forebrain is always seeing a little bit of dopamine\\n\\nfrom that system.\\n\\nIf you were then to anticipate food\\n\\nand you're relatively hungry, that would double.\\n\\nSo this probably happened when you decide to eat lunch today\\n\\nif you were hungry prior to eating lunch.\\n\\nIt doubles in the anticipation of the food.\\n\\nAnd then depending on how much you enjoyed that food,\\n\\nit might triple or quadruple.\\n\\nIt might be lower than it was during the anticipation\\n\\nas we talked about before.\\n\\nSo there's an approximate doubling under conditions\\n\\nof desiring and consuming food.\\n\\nLet's take nicotine as the next example.\\n\\nFor people that use nicotine, either smoking, vaping,\\n\\nsnuffing or dipping, all routes of nicotine administration\\n\\nthat I covered in our episode about nicotine,\\n\\nthere's about a 150% increase in the rate\\n\\nof dopamine neuron firing.\\n\\nCocaine is going to increase the rate of dopamine output\\n\\ninto the prefrontal cortex by about 1,000%.\\n\\nOkay, so what you're really talking about here\\n\\nis a 10-fold increase in the amount of dopamine\\n\\nthat's released into the prefrontal cortex\\n\\nas measured by the rates of firing\\n\\nof these dopamine neurons.\\n\\nMethamphetamine is going to be anywhere from 1,000%,\\n\\nanywhere up to 10,000%.\\n\\nIt really varies depending on the potency of the drug\\n\\nand a few other factors.\\n\\nAnd here's where perhaps it gets a little more interesting.\\n\\nSome of you are probably wondering about caffeine\\n\\nor about sex or about video games.\\n\\nNow, there are the numbers vary tremendously\\n\\nand it's really important to understand\\n\\nthat across the board, not just for caffeine, sex,\\n\\nvideo games, but also for nicotine, alcohol\\n\\nand other substances and what we call motivated behaviors,\\n\\nsome of which are part of a healthy life\\n\\nlike eating and reproduction,\\n\\nprovided it's age-appropriate, context-appropriate,\\n\\nspecies-appropriate, consensual,\\n\\nwell, then we consider it adaptive.\\n\\nIf it's not, well, then consider it maladaptive.\\n\\nSome people will sit down to play a video game.\\n\\nThey really like video games.\\n\\nAnd as they're sitting down,\\n\\nthey will experience a five-fold increase\\n\\nin the rate of dopamine output from their nucleus accumbens.\\n\\nFor other people, it's going to be a 10-fold increase.\\n\\nFor other people like me who don't like video games\\n\\nvery much, I don't have anything against them.\\n\\nI don't dislike them, but it doesn't do much for me.\\n\\nIt might not cause any increase whatsoever.\\n\\nIt might even cause a decrease in dopamine.\\n\\nSo there's a lot of individual variability.\\n\\nFor sex, it turns out to be a range.\\n\\nSo the typical range that's cited in the literature\\n\\nis anywhere from a four to five-fold increase\\n\\nin the rate of dopamine neuron firing.\\n\\nHowever, there are certain individuals\\n\\nfor which that number is doubled.\\n\\nCaffeine is a little bit of a special circumstance\\n\\nbecause caffeine has the property\\n\\nof not just causing the release of dopamine\\n\\nbut increasing the amount of dopamine receptors over time.\\n\\nAnd there aren't a lot of excellent measurements\\n\\nof the amount of dopamine released\\n\\nas a function of caffeine intake\\n\\nin different populations of humans.\\n\\nIt's mostly animal studies.\\n\\nBut what we think based on the Gestalt,\\n\\nbased on the overall picture of the literature\\n\\nis that it's an approximate doubling\\n\\nof the dopamine signaling that's coming out\\n\\nof the VTA nucleus accumbens to prefrontal cortex\\n\\nwhen we anticipate and when we drink our coffee.\\n\\nAgain, I really want to be clear\\n\\nthat for all of these things,\\n\\nthese are relative levels and they are distribution.\\n\\nSo if we were to plot them out on paper,\\n\\nyou would see that these are not bar graphs.\\n\\nThese are overlapping curves to some extent.\\n\\nSo some people are going to achieve more dopamine release\\n\\nor less dopamine release from one behavior or substance.\\n\\nHowever, it's very clear that cocaine, methamphetamine,\\n\\neven heroin for that matter are way out\\n\\non the right-hand side of the curve\\n\\ncausing enormous increases in dopamine very quickly.\\n\\nAnd the other things that we described\\n\\nhave again a distribution that is more leftward shifted\\n\\non this imaginary plot that I'm creating.\\n\\nIt's a lot of individual variability.\\n\\nHowever, it's fascinating that dopamine\\n\\nis the single molecule that's causing the craving\\n\\nand pursuit and experience\\n\\nof all of these substances and behaviors.\\n\\nAnd the learning of all of that craving pursuit\\n\\nand actual experience is what predicts\\n\\nwhether or not we will re-engage, reuse that substance\\n\\nor not re-engage in a behavior or not\\n\\nand how frequently we will do that.\\n\\nSo that's addiction.\\n\\nBut if you understand how the height of those peaks\\n\\nin dopamine and the rate to reach those peaks\\n\\nand the troughs that result and how long the troughs take\\n\\nto get back to baseline,\\n\\nif you understand or a little or all of that,\\n\\nyou're really in a terrific position\\n\\nto understand how to leverage the dopamine system\\n\\nfor the pursuit of healthy goals and behaviors.\\n\\nI should mention one thing about recovery from addiction,\\n\\nwhich is that the reset of all that dopamine circuitry\\n\\nfrom unhealthy to healthy often involves,\\n\\ndepending on the addiction, 30 days of complete abstinence.\\n\\nThat 30 days of complete abstinence\\n\\ninevitably involves a lot of pain and discomfort\\n\\nand craving, anxiety, insomnia, et cetera,\\n\\nthat relates to the big trough in dopamine\\n\\nthat inevitably occurs.\\n\\nNow, of course, there are some addictions\\n\\nsuch as severe alcohol addiction\\n\\nand in some cases, opiate addiction\\n\\nthat immediate and sustained abstinence\\n\\ncannot be used as the tool.\\n\\nSomebody really needs to work with an addiction specialist\\n\\nand sometimes there needs to be a tapering off\\n\\nof the substance.\\n\\nFor other addictions, it can be quote unquote, cold turkey.\\n\\nAnd then of course, there are other addictions,\\n\\nparticular food and sex,\\n\\nbut sometimes even things like video games\\n\\nfor which the desired outcome is not necessarily\\n\\nto eliminate the behavior completely,\\n\\nbut to set some constraints around the behavior\\n\\nso that it's not occurring to the exclusion\\n\\nof other pleasureful things in life\\n\\nand adaptive things in life.\\n\\nAnd for that, there is the requirement\\n\\nfor what are called the binding behaviors.\\n\\nWe'll get back to binding behaviors later,\\n\\nbut binding behaviors are behaviors\\n\\nin which people bind their behavior\\n\\naround a particular substance use\\n\\nor around a particular behavioral addiction\\n\\nlike sex, video games, et cetera,\\n\\nin space and or time.\\n\\nIn space, meaning they might only engage\\n\\nin those particular behaviors in certain places\\n\\nand certain times when it's context appropriate.\\n\\nAnd there are numerous examples of binding behaviors\\n\\nin space and time.\\n\\nIt all has to do with clamping or directing\\n\\nwhen the engagement with the dopamine releasing behavior\\n\\nis going to occur.\\n\\nSo what's happening when people decide to go cold turkey\\n\\nor they use these binding behaviors?\\n\\nWell, what's happening is that people are engaging\\n\\nthe specific circuitry within the prefrontal cortex\\n\\nthat as I mentioned at the beginning of the episode\\n\\nare important for context setting.\\n\\nSo in the cases of binding behaviors,\\n\\nthe prefrontal cortex is essentially getting trained up\\n\\nto understand that, okay, certain things like food\\n\\nor perhaps sex or perhaps video games,\\n\\nthey're okay if they are done or consumed\\n\\nin appropriate amounts or in particular contexts.\\n\\nThat requires the context setting goal-directed behavior\\n\\nthat the prefrontal cortex is responsible.\\n\\nOkay, so for the last 10 or 15 minutes,\\n\\nwe've been talking a lot about addiction\\n\\nand actually this is not an episode about addiction.\\n\\nHowever, if you understand a little bit\\n\\nabout the dopamine dynamics in an addiction,\\n\\nyou can leverage that knowledge\\n\\ntowards healthy adaptive goal pursuit\\n\\nand achieving your goals.\\n\\nSo let's think about that in the context\\n\\nof what generates dopamine peaks,\\n\\nwhat generates desire to pursue goals,\\n\\nwhat causes our readout of whether or not\\n\\nwe achieved a goal or not.\\n\\nIn other words, what allows us to learn\\n\\nhow to pursue goals of different kinds,\\n\\nnot just get good at achieving one kind of goal,\\n\\nbut really understand and get really, really good\\n\\nat setting goals and pursuing goals of different kinds\\n\\nthat are adaptive in different areas of life,\\n\\nbecause we all are going to have to pursue goals\\n\\nin school, work, relationships, fitness,\\n\\nmental health, and on and on\\n\\nin order to be our best selves, that's clear.\\n\\nWell, all of that is possible using the same basic set\\n\\nof dopamine circuits\\n\\nand the same basic dynamics of dopamine.\\n\\nSo for instance, if we are going to feel motivated at all,\\n\\nthat is if we are going to wake up in the morning\\n\\nor have any period of time during our day\\n\\nin which we feel like we are capable of pursuing goals,\\n\\nwe are going to have to have a healthy level\\n\\nof baseline dopamine.\\n\\nIn other words, we are going to have to have enough dopamine\\n\\nin the wave pool, enough water in the wave pool, that is,\\n\\nbefore we can generate any waves or peaks in dopamine,\\n\\nlet alone troughs and the rest.\\n\\nSo how do we achieve a healthy baseline level of dopamine?\\n\\nWell, there we can really look\\n\\nto some foundational practices,\\n\\npractices that perhaps you've heard about on this podcast\\n\\nbefore and that to some of you might seem a little mundane,\\n\\nalthough some of them are a bit more sophisticated,\\n\\nmaybe even esoteric.\\n\\nThe good news is that we can all control these things\\n\\nand they don't require purchasing anything,\\n\\nbut they do require some degree of regular upkeep\\n\\nand effort.\\n\\nThose things include what I call the very basics.\\n\\nNow the very basics put in the context\\n\\nof today's discussion are the things\\n\\nthat put water in the wave pool.\\n\\nThose are going to be getting sufficient amounts\\n\\nof quality sleep each night,\\n\\nsomething that we've done several episodes on\\n\\nand have online toolkits for.\\n\\nSo you can see the master your sleep episode,\\n\\nthe perfect your sleep episode,\\n\\nthe light and health episode.\\n\\nIf you want to skip all that and just get right to the tools,\\n\\nwe have a sleep toolkit,\\n\\nor it's actually called the toolkit for sleep\\n\\nthat you can access at hubermanlab.com,\\n\\ncompletely zero cost.\\n\\nYou just go there and download that toolkit.\\n\\nGetting sufficient sleep each night\\n\\nliterally restores your dopamine reserves.\\n\\nIt allows dopamine to be present\\n\\nand for you to have a level of baseline dopamine\\n\\nthat will allow you to even consider your goals\\n\\nin any kind of meaningful or reasonable way.\\n\\nSecond, there are practices that are supported\\n\\nby the scientific literature\\n\\nto increase your baseline level of dopamine\\n\\nthat are independent of sleep, but are similar to sleep.\\n\\nAnd I like to refer to these as non-sleep deep rest.\\n\\nThis is not meditation.\\n\\nThere's actually very little evidence\\n\\nthat meditation of the traditional kind\\n\\nof sitting eyes closed, third eye sent,\\n\\nfocusing on your third eye center,\\n\\nwhich is this area behind your forehead.\\n\\nThere is very little evidence\\n\\nthat that increases levels of dopamine.\\n\\nThere is a place for meditation\\n\\nin the context of today's discussion,\\n\\nbut I'll repeat, meditation itself is a focusing exercise.\\n\\nIt is not known to increase dopamine.\\n\\nHowever, non-sleep deep rest, so-called NSDR,\\n\\nvery similar, although different\\n\\nto what's sometimes called yoga nidra,\\n\\nwhich is where you lie there.\\n\\nYou do a sort of body scan, some long exhale breathing.\\n\\nNSDR is very similar.\\n\\nYou can find a link to a zero cost NSDR on YouTube.\\n\\nIt's a 10 minute long one.\\n\\nThere are also 20 and 30 minute ones out there,\\n\\nalso on YouTube,\\n\\nbut I'll provide a link to the 10 minute one.\\n\\nThose have been shown to increase the amount of dopamine\\n\\nin your dopamine reserves by up to 65%,\\n\\nwhich is a remarkable number.\\n\\nSo quality sleep, non-sleep deep rest,\\n\\nAKA yoga nidra, very powerful ways\\n\\nto keep your baseline level of dopamine\\n\\nat a sufficient level.\\n\\nIn addition to that,\\n\\nnutrition no doubt plays a role\\n\\nin your baseline level of dopamine,\\n\\nbecause tyrosine, the amino acid,\\n\\nis the rate limiting enzyme for the synthesis of dopamine.\\n\\nTyrosine is present in varying levels in different foods.\\n\\nYou can look those up online.\\n\\nYou just simply put in a search\\n\\nfor tyrosine levels in different foods,\\n\\neverything from particular cheeses,\\n\\nlike Parmesan cheese has high levels of tyrosine,\\n\\ncertain meats, certain nuts, certain vegetables.\\n\\nWithout getting into details and specifics,\\n\\nyou can find those there,\\n\\nbut you need proper nutrition and therefore nutrients,\\n\\nin particular tyrosine,\\n\\nin order to have sufficient levels of baseline dopamine.\\n\\nThe third thing on the list,\\n\\nand again, these are things that we come back to\\n\\nalmost every episode,\\n\\nbut I don't think they can be repeated enough\\n\\nbecause these are really things\\n\\nthat we need to focus on every 24 hours.\\n\\nYou might be able to skip a day here or there\\n\\nif you get sick or you're traveling,\\n\\nor you have some major life event,\\n\\nbut really every 24 hours, we need to re-up our sleep.\\n\\nWe need to re-up our nutrients.\\n\\nEven if you're fasting,\\n\\nyou're re-upping your nutrients\\n\\nfrom stored sources within your body.\\n\\nThe third thing is sunlight,\\n\\nmorning sunlight in particular.\\n\\nI've done extensive episodes about this.\\n\\nCheck out the episode on lighting your health\\n\\nif you want all the details,\\n\\nbut you want to try and view sunlight\\n\\nas early in the day as possible.\\n\\nFive to 10 minutes on a clear day, minimum.\\n\\n10 to 20 minutes on a cloudy day, minimum.\\n\\n20 or 30 minutes on a very overcast day, minimum.\\n\\nWithout sunglasses, don't stare at the sun.\\n\\nPlease don't damage your eyes.\\n\\nLook off, slightly off from the sun,\\n\\nbut yes, you want to face eastward towards the sun.\\n\\nAnd on those cloudy days,\\n\\nthat's especially important to do.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nWell, viewing morning sunlight\\n\\nincreases cortisol early in the day,\\n\\nwhich is excellent because you want cortisol\\n\\nelevated early in the day\\n\\nand you want it lower later in the day.\\n\\nAnd because of the relationship\\n\\nbetween the cells in your eye that sense sunlight,\\n\\nspecifically morning sunlight,\\n\\nbelieve it or not, that happens,\\n\\nand signal to your hypothalamus\\n\\nand the relationship between the hypothalamus\\n\\nand the pituitary and other endocrine organs,\\n\\nit sets in motion a dopamine-related cascade\\n\\nin neuromodulators, dopamine,\\n\\nand hormones that lead to states of wellbeing,\\n\\nelevated mood, alertness, et cetera, throughout the day.\\n\\nIt also helps your sleep at night,\\n\\nbut today we're talking about dopamine.\\n\\nSo yes, believe it or not,\\n\\nthat morning sunlight exposure\\n\\ndoes increase your levels of dopamine, not just cortisol.\\n\\nAnd fourth on the list is going to be movement.\\n\\nExercise of varying kinds.\\n\\nIt could be resistance training,\\n\\nit could be cardiovascular training.\\n\\nThat does increase levels of dopamine.\\n\\nHere, we're not talking about achieving peaks in dopamine.\\n\\nThat could be accomplished through\\n\\nsetting a personal record, a PR,\\n\\nor through sprints or heavy lifts,\\n\\nor learning some new dynamic movement.\\n\\nWhat we're really talking about here\\n\\nis getting into a regular exercise program\\n\\nof if not every day, at least five days a week,\\n\\na mixture of cardiovascular and resistance exercise.\\n\\nThat we also know is known to elevate\\n\\nand maintain an elevated level of baseline dopamine.\\n\\nSo it's not just about the euphoria\\n\\nyou feel during or after exercise.\\n\\nIt's also about the baseline level of dopamine\\n\\nthat's achieved through regular movement\\n\\nand engaging in movement.\\n\\nAnd if you're asking, how could that be?\\n\\nWell, you already know the answer.\\n\\nThe circuits in the brain and body that generate movement,\\n\\nnot just goal-seeking, but movement itself,\\n\\nas I mentioned earlier,\\n\\nthat nigrostriatal pathway.\\n\\nAnd yes, that circuit is separate\\n\\nfrom the VTA nucleus accumbens to cortical circuit,\\n\\nthe mesocortical circuit\\n\\nthat we've mainly been focusing on today,\\n\\nbut they interact.\\n\\nAnd so by engaging in regular movement,\\n\\nyou ensure that you're maintaining elevated levels\\n\\nof baseline dopamine, which is what you want\\n\\nif you're going to be able to engage\\n\\nin any kind of motivated pursuit behavior of any kind.\\n\\nSo those are the fundamentals that will set\\n\\nthe level of baseline dopamine in your system.\\n\\nA couple of key points.\\n\\nYes, there is variation based on both genetics\\n\\nand circumstance in baseline levels of dopamine.\\n\\nIf someone's going through a particular hard time,\\n\\nor if somebody inherited a gene\\n\\nin the dopamine synthesis pathway\\n\\nthat simply affords them higher levels of baseline dopamine,\\n\\nwe likely know these people,\\n\\nthey seem hyper-motivated all the time,\\n\\nnot just based on prior success,\\n\\nbut they just seem to have a lot of energy\\n\\nand a lot of go-drive.\\n\\nWhen you talk about activation energy,\\n\\nsome of you may know what that term means,\\n\\nothers of you won't.\\n\\nHaving low activation energy is great.\\n\\nI mean, the amount of energy that it takes\\n\\nto get into action to pursue adaptive\\n\\nand meaningful, healthy goals.\\n\\nSome people just seem to have lower activation energy\\n\\nand higher levels of dopamine\\n\\nare probably associated with that.\\n\\nSome of us have lower levels of baseline dopamine.\\n\\nRegardless, everyone needs to engage\\n\\nin the foundational things\\n\\nthat I just mentioned a few moments ago,\\n\\nevery 24 hours, or at least strive to.\\n\\nThere is no escaping that.\\n\\nI'd like to just take a brief moment\\n\\nand thank one of our podcast sponsors,\\n\\nwhich is InsideTracker.\\n\\nInsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform\\n\\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\\n\\nto help you better understand your body\\n\\nand help you reach your health goals.\\n\\nI've long been a believer\\n\\nin getting regular blood work done\\n\\nfor the simple reason that blood work\\n\\nis the only way that you can monitor the markers,\\n\\nsuch as hormone markers, lipids, metabolic factors, et cetera,\\n\\nthat impact your immediate and long-term health.\\n\\nOne major challenge with blood work, however,\\n\\nis that most of the time,\\n\\nit does not come back with any information about what to do\\n\\nin order to move the values for hormones, metabolic factors,\\n\\nlipids, et cetera, into the ranges that you want.\\n\\nWith InsideTracker,\\n\\nchanging those values becomes very straightforward\\n\\nbecause it has a personalized dashboard that you can use\\n\\nto address the nutrition-based, behavior-based,\\n\\nsupplement-based approaches that you can use\\n\\nin order to move those values into the ranges\\n\\nthat are optimal for you, your vitality,\\n\\nand your longevity.\\n\\nInsideTracker now includes a measurement\\n\\nof apolipoprotein B, so-called APO-B,\\n\\nin their ultimate plan.\\n\\nAPO-B is a key marker of cardiovascular health,\\n\\nand therefore, there's extreme value\\n\\nto knowing your APO-B levels.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\\n\\nyou can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman\\n\\nto get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.\\n\\nAgain, that's insidetracker.com slash Huberman\\n\\nto get 20% off.\\n\\nNow, there are things that can increase one's baseline level\\n\\nof dopamine further,\\n\\nand some of those get us into the realm of supplements\\n\\nand prescription drugs,\\n\\nbut for now, I just want to mention a few of them\\n\\nthat are purely behavioral in nature, are zero cost,\\n\\nand that have been shown in the research literature\\n\\nto increase baseline levels of dopamine\\n\\nfor long periods of time.\\n\\nAnd this is important,\\n\\nbecause if any of you are out there\\n\\nlistening to this thing about peaks and troughs\\n\\nand baselines, you might be asking,\\n\\nwait, what's the difference between a baseline\\n\\nand a peak, really?\\n\\nBecause if, for instance, you get a big peak,\\n\\nwell, that's a peak in the baseline,\\n\\nso how do you distinguish between peak and baseline?\\n\\nAnd, well, there's a trough,\\n\\nand let's say that trough lasts an hour.\\n\\nIs that hour-long trough your baseline?\\n\\nOr where's your set point?\\n\\nHow do you establish your set point?\\n\\nAnd more importantly, how do you raise your set point?\\n\\nAh, well, if you're not already asking that question,\\n\\nI just asked it for you.\\n\\nI define an increase in your baseline level in dopamine\\n\\nto be anything that increases dopamine\\n\\nfor more than one hour.\\n\\nWhen we think about cocaine, amphetamine, pornography,\\n\\nsex, caffeine, things of that sort,\\n\\nregardless of how long one engages\\n\\nin a bout of those behaviors or substances,\\n\\nthe increases in dopamine\\n\\nare going to be relatively short-lived\\n\\non the order of minutes to an hour, sometimes longer.\\n\\nNow, I didn't say that's how long you're engaging\\n\\nin the behaviors.\\n\\nI said that's how long those increases in dopamine\\n\\nare going to occur,\\n\\neven if you were to continually engage in those behaviors.\\n\\nAnd remember, with continual engagement\\n\\nin a dopamine-spiking behavior,\\n\\nbehavior that increases dopamine peaks,\\n\\nthe height of those peaks, remember,\\n\\ngets lower and lower and lower,\\n\\nespecially in a short amount of time\\n\\nand then drops below baseline.\\n\\nThere are tools and techniques that you can use\\n\\nto elevate your baseline level of dopamine\\n\\nfor long periods of time.\\n\\nAnd here, again, this is done in addition\\n\\nto the basic tools that I mentioned a few moments ago.\\n\\nThe simplest one for which there are excellent data,\\n\\nand here I'm referring to data published\\n\\nin the European Journal of Physiology,\\n\\nI'll provide a link to this,\\n\\nis that exposure of your body up to the neck to cold water,\\n\\nand it doesn't have to be super cold, by the way,\\n\\nto cold water has been shown to increase baseline levels\\n\\nof dopamine and the other so-called catecholamines,\\n\\nwhich include norepinephrine and epinephrine.\\n\\nBut for sake of today's discussion,\\n\\ndopamine in particular for not just one,\\n\\nbut at least two and probably as long as four or five hours.\\n\\nThere've been some additional scientific studies\\n\\nafter the paper I just mentioned,\\n\\nand it's really remarkable.\\n\\nYou can accomplish this a number of different ways.\\n\\nYou could get into a cold shower in the morning,\\n\\nand I do recommend doing this in the morning.\\n\\nAnd in that case, it's okay to get the water on your head.\\n\\nIn fact, I recommend it.\\n\\nYou could get into an ice bath.\\n\\nYou could get into a cold plunge.\\n\\nIn these circumstances, I'm not suggesting this\\n\\nfor sake of increasing metabolism or fat loss.\\n\\nYou know, the whole discussion around deliberate cold\\n\\nand metabolism and fat loss\\n\\nhas become a little bit controversial.\\n\\nSo we won't go there now,\\n\\nmostly because we're focused on the clear ability\\n\\nof deliberate cold exposure to increase dopamine\\n\\nfor long periods of time, AKA your dopamine baseline.\\n\\nThe ways to do this vary depending on the temperature.\\n\\nSo for instance, there are data pointing to the fact\\n\\nthat if you want to get a long lasting increase\\n\\nin your baseline dopamine,\\n\\nyou could take a very cold shower or cold plunge\\n\\nor ice bath for a very brief period of time,\\n\\nanywhere from 30 seconds to two minutes,\\n\\nmaybe three minutes, but probably 30 seconds to two minutes.\\n\\nNow you might ask, what is very cold?\\n\\nHere I have to be careful\\n\\nbecause I don't want to recommend anything\\n\\nthat's going to cause anyone to have a heart attack\\n\\nor going to shock or anything of that sort.\\n\\nIt's going to vary by person\\n\\ndepending on your level of cold tolerance.\\n\\nWhat I recommend is if you are going for the short exposure,\\n\\nlong dopamine release approach,\\n\\nthat is 30 seconds to two minutes,\\n\\nthat you start warmer than you think you need to,\\n\\nand then you ease into it over a few days.\\n\\nBut we're really talking about ranges in temperature\\n\\nfrom anywhere from about 37 degrees Fahrenheit\\n\\nto about 55 degrees Fahrenheit.\\n\\nAgain, be careful, approach it with caution\\n\\nand ease into it.\\n\\nI do recommend doing this early in the day.\\n\\nAnd I should mention not after strength\\n\\nor hypertrophy training because within the six hours\\n\\nafter strength or hypertrophy training,\\n\\nthis deliberate cold exposure,\\n\\nespecially immersion up to the neck\\n\\ncan suppress the strength and hypertrophy adaptation\\n\\nthat the training is designed to accomplish.\\n\\nSo that's one approach.\\n\\nThe other approach that's supported by the literature\\n\\nto increase baseline levels of dopamine\\n\\nfor very long periods of time.\\n\\nIn fact, this is the original approach\\n\\nis to get into warmer water.\\n\\nSo not warm, but warmer.\\n\\nSo 60 degree Fahrenheit water up to the neck\\n\\nand to stay there for about 45 to 60 minutes.\\n\\nThe reason I don't think most people will do that\\n\\nor that most people would prefer\\n\\na shorter colder exposure protocol\\n\\nis that most people don't have 45 to 60 minutes each morning\\n\\nto get into water and sit there.\\n\\nAnd in that study, they actually had them sitting\\n\\nin lawn chairs, basically, in the shallow end of a pool\\n\\nup to their neck for a full 60 minutes\\n\\nand then measuring dopamine release and so forth.\\n\\nSo there are a bunch of different ways to do this.\\n\\nI should emphasize, I don't think you need to be\\n\\nsuper precise about the temperature and even the duration.\\n\\nWhat I recommend is find a temperature\\n\\nthat's uncomfortably cold to you,\\n\\nmeaning that you feel agitated and you want to get out,\\n\\nbut that you're confident you can safely stay in.\\n\\nAnd again, I can't give a simple prescriptive to everybody,\\n\\nbut this is known to increase baseline levels\\n\\nof dopamine significantly.\\n\\nIn fact, double them or more for long periods of time,\\n\\nmeaning hours, up to four, maybe even six hours\\n\\ninto the day, which is one of the reasons\\n\\nI suggest doing this early in the day.\\n\\nI happen to get into a cold plunge or take a cold shower\\n\\nfirst thing in the morning.\\n\\nI do go outside and get my sunlight first sometimes.\\n\\nSometimes I do the cold first.\\n\\nIt really depends on my circumstances\\n\\nand how I'm feeling that day.\\n\\nI don't think it really matters which one you do first,\\n\\nbut you want to try and get both of those in\\n\\nearly in the day because you really want the catecholamines\\n\\nand cortisol elevated early in the day.\\n\\nOkay, so that's deliberate cold exposure.\\n\\nWe already talked about exercise.\\n\\nSo if you're doing your exercise early in the day,\\n\\nthere's no reason why it couldn't be done in concert\\n\\nwith this deliberate cold exposure.\\n\\nI recommend doing the deliberate cold exposure first\\n\\nfor the reasons we talked about a few minutes ago.\\n\\nAnd then of course, there are compounds,\\n\\nboth prescription and over-the-counter compounds\\n\\nthat can indeed raise your baseline levels of dopamine\\n\\nfor an hour or more.\\n\\nAnd when I say an hour or more,\\n\\nit really depends on individual variation\\n\\nin terms of how quickly you metabolize dopamine.\\n\\nAnd it depends on individual variation in how you manage\\n\\nor tolerate different dosages of drugs\\n\\nand different types of drugs.\\n\\nSo the typical drugs,\\n\\nand here I'm talking about legal prescription drugs\\n\\nfor increasing dopamine are things like Ritalin, Adderall.\\n\\nModafinil and Armodafinil also tap into this system.\\n\\nAnd I did an entire episode about ADHD,\\n\\nwhich is the typical context in which you hear\\n\\nabout these prescription drugs.\\n\\nBut assuming it's prescribed by a doctor\\n\\nfor either clinical reasons like ADHD or for other reasons,\\n\\nall of those compounds do significantly increase\\n\\nbaseline levels of dopamine for many, many hours.\\n\\nThat's absolutely clear and it's one of the major reasons\\n\\nwhy those drugs are so effective\\n\\nin increasing motivation and attention.\\n\\nThen there are compounds that are sold over-the-counter,\\n\\nthings like amino acids, such as L-tyrosine itself.\\n\\nThat's a very commonly sold and used amino acid.\\n\\nIt's present in a lot of so-called pre-workout formulas.\\n\\nI, as many of you know,\\n\\nam a fan of single ingredient supplements for the most part,\\n\\naside from foundational supplements like AG-1,\\n\\nwhich give you many, many micronutrients kind of all together\\n\\nbecause it would be nearly impossible\\n\\nto consume each of those as individual ingredients\\n\\nand get the right amounts, et cetera.\\n\\nBut for all other supplements,\\n\\nI'm a big believer in parsing what you need\\n\\nand what's most effective for you\\n\\nin single ingredient formulations.\\n\\nAnd the typical ways in which people work\\n\\nto elevate their baseline levels of dopamine\\n\\nwith supplements are using either L-tyrosine,\\n\\nwhich as I mentioned earlier,\\n\\nis the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine,\\n\\nor by using what's called mucuna purines,\\n\\nwhich is actually very similar to L-dopa,\\n\\nwhich is the treatment for Parkinson's.\\n\\nMucuna purines actually comes\\n\\nfrom the velvety outside coating of a certain bean.\\n\\nI know it sounds really esoteric,\\n\\nbut that's actually where it's found in nature,\\n\\nand is really 99% L-dopa.\\n\\nAnd I confess, having tried mucuna purines,\\n\\nhaving examined the scientific literature\\n\\non mucuna purines, there is some evidence\\n\\nthat it can increase dopamine,\\n\\nespecially in that tuberinfradibular pathway,\\n\\nbecause it can tap into some of the hormone-related functions\\n\\nof the pituitary.\\n\\nIt does increase alertness and mood.\\n\\nIt might even increase libido, motivation, et cetera.\\n\\nBut the effects of mucuna purines tend to be very much\\n\\nof the increasing the peak in dopamine,\\n\\nand then very quickly dropping that peak.\\n\\nIn other words, the peak trough phenomenon,\\n\\nnot for increasing baseline levels of dopamine.\\n\\nNow, it's likely different for people with Parkinson's\\n\\nwho are taking prescription drugs\\n\\nthat are similar to mucuna purines.\\n\\nSo if people have Parkinson's,\\n\\noftentimes they are prescribed things like L-dopa,\\n\\nwhich is in the pathway to dopamine synthesis,\\n\\nor they are prescribed things like bromocryptine,\\n\\nwhich will indeed increase dopamine.\\n\\nAnd I do realize that some people\\n\\nuse those prescription drugs recreationally,\\n\\nwhich I don't recommend.\\n\\nThose drugs can be used to increase baseline levels\\n\\nof dopamine, but more typically they cause peaks\\n\\nin dopamine and troughs in dopamine,\\n\\nwhich is why I do not recommend them.\\n\\nThey are not going to allow you to accomplish what you want\\n\\nif your goal is more motivation, et cetera.\\n\\nIn fact, they are likely to do the opposite,\\n\\ngive you a big peak in alertness,\\n\\nand then a crash that can include depressive symptoms\\n\\nand just not feeling very good.\\n\\nL-tyrosine, however, has been examined\\n\\nin the scientific literature,\\n\\nand at reasonably low dosages,\\n\\nhas been shown to increase circulating\\n\\nand available levels of dopamine,\\n\\nboth in the brain and body,\\n\\nand lead to increased cognitive performance,\\n\\nand in some cases, physical output.\\n\\nI'll provide links to a few of these studies,\\n\\nbut the two that I really parsed most finely\\n\\nfor sake of this episode,\\n\\nreally just focus on taking L-tyrosine\\n\\nunder conditions where your baseline levels of dopamine\\n\\nare reduced due to stress,\\n\\nand under conditions where there's no stress\\n\\nand people are trying to increase\\n\\ntheir baseline levels of dopamine\\n\\nfor sake of improving cognitive function.\\n\\nThe first paper is entitled\\n\\nEffective Tyrosine on Cognitive Function\\n\\nand Blood Pressure Under Stress.\\n\\nI'll provide a link to this in the show note captions,\\n\\nand it's one of many papers, really,\\n\\ndating back to the early 90s,\\n\\nexploring how relatively high, frankly,\\n\\nrelatively high dosages of L-tyrosine\\n\\ntaken under conditions of stress\\n\\nallow people to rescue some of their cognitive function\\n\\nin terms of working memory tasks\\n\\nand other kinds of cognitive tasks,\\n\\nvisual pursuit tasks, and so on.\\n\\nThe second paper is entitled\\n\\nTyrosine Improves Working Memory\\n\\nin a Multitasking Environment,\\n\\nand the second paper is perhaps more interesting\\n\\nbecause it involves exploring\\n\\nthe use of tyrosine supplementation,\\n\\nbasically taking tyrosine about an hour\\n\\nbefore a cognitive task or set of cognitive tasks\\n\\nthat involve a lot of multitasking,\\n\\nWorking memory, for those of you that don't know,\\n\\nis your ability to maintain small batches of information\\n\\nin your mind for relatively short periods of time.\\n\\nSo, for instance, if I tell you my phone number\\n\\nor the phone number where I grew up, 493-2931,\\n\\nif you can remember that,\\n\\nchances are you'll remember it for 30 seconds, 60 seconds,\\n\\nbut that you won't remember it tomorrow\\n\\nbecause there's really no reason to.\\n\\nA lot of the tasks that we do throughout the day\\n\\ninvolve working memory,\\n\\nand working memory is very subject to interference\\n\\nfrom other tasks that we happen to be doing,\\n\\nlike looking at our phone or having a conversation\\n\\nor trying to navigate through a city.\\n\\nIt involves a lot of attention,\\n\\nand this study shows that tyrosine improves working memory,\\n\\nespecially in the context of multitasking\\n\\nand having a lot of conflicting goals,\\n\\nand they did a number of really nice experiments here.\\n\\nAgain, it's a small study, not that many subjects,\\n\\nbut it's one of several papers.\\n\\nIn fact, this is the paper that kind of set in motion,\\n\\nthe domino of other papers,\\n\\nexploring the efficacy of L-tyrosine\\n\\nfor cognitive performance.\\n\\nAnd they looked at working memory tasks, of course,\\n\\nbut also auditory visual tasks,\\n\\nand they involve some interference of visual cues\\n\\nand things of that sort,\\n\\nand they saw some really interesting effects.\\n\\nBasically, when we need to attend to multiple things\\n\\nat the same time, L-tyrosine can help us do that,\\n\\nat least as it relates to memory.\\n\\nWhen I say L-tyrosine, what I really mean\\n\\nis having your baseline levels of dopamine elevated\\n\\ncan really help navigate multitasking environments,\\n\\nespecially as it relates to working memory,\\n\\nand this is true under conditions of stress\\n\\nand under conditions of not stressful, okay?\\n\\nYou might say, well, isn't multitasking stressful itself?\\n\\nYes, it can be, but when we talk about\\n\\nunder conditions of stress,\\n\\nwe're talking about people who are sleep deprived,\\n\\nwe're talking about people that are under\\n\\nother kinds of psychological or physical stress,\\n\\nL-tyrosine can help in that context as well.\\n\\nSo as I mentioned before, in these studies,\\n\\nthey use very high dosages of L-tyrosine,\\n\\nso high that actually I don't recommend them.\\n\\nThey did measure stress hormones,\\n\\nthey did measure blood pressure and things of that sort,\\n\\nbut I want to caution you, I do not recommend,\\n\\nI will say it again, I do not recommend following\\n\\nthe dosages that were used in these two studies\\n\\nbecause they are exceedingly high.\\n\\nThey used 100 milligrams per kilogram of body weight\\n\\nof tyrosine one hour prior to these cognitive tasks.\\n\\nNow, I weigh about 220 pounds,\\n\\nI'm a little bit lighter than that,\\n\\nso that's 100 kilograms approximately.\\n\\nTranslated from this study, that would mean\\n\\nthat had I participated in the study\\n\\nand I wasn't in the placebo group,\\n\\nbut I was in the L-tyrosine group,\\n\\nI would have been given 10,000 milligrams of L-tyrosine,\\n\\nwhich is 10 grams of L-tyrosine, I do not recommend that.\\n\\nIn fact, there are papers showing that\\n\\nas little as 500 milligrams, but perhaps up to one gram,\\n\\nthat is a thousand milligrams,\\n\\nor 1500 milligrams, a gram and a half of L-tyrosine,\\n\\ntaken 30 to 60 minutes before a cognitive or physical task\\n\\ncan increase baseline levels of dopamine\\n\\nfor extended periods of time and thereby improve performance\\n\\non those mental or physical tasks.\\n\\nSo if you are somebody who's interested\\n\\nin trying L-tyrosine, please know that the increases\\n\\nin baseline levels of dopamine can be substantial.\\n\\nThey are long lasting, which qualifies them\\n\\nas baseline increases as opposed to peaks.\\n\\nAnd I would say you should also start\\n\\nwith the lowest possible dose.\\n\\nSo for most people, 250 to 500 milligrams\\n\\nis going to be a reasonable starting dose.\\n\\nDepending on your body weight,\\n\\nsmaller people start with 250, larger, maybe 500.\\n\\nKeep an eye on whether or not you're combining it\\n\\nwith caffeine or with any other stimulants.\\n\\nAnd keep in mind that, again,\\n\\nthe bigger the peak in dopamine,\\n\\nthe bigger the trough in dopamine afterwards.\\n\\nSo pay attention to whether or not you experience a crash\\n\\nthat same day or the next day.\\n\\nBut chances are,\\n\\nif you're using a relatively low level of L-tyrosine,\\n\\nso anywhere from 250, maybe 500 milligrams\\n\\nor a thousand milligrams of L-tyrosine\\n\\nprior to cognitive or physical work\\n\\nand taken early in the day, by the way,\\n\\nbecause this can act as a bit of a stimulant,\\n\\nthat you're going to achieve these long lasting increases\\n\\nin baseline dopamine.\\n\\nBut please also keep in mind that I always, always suggest\\n\\nthat you engage in the proper behaviors\\n\\nand you disengage from the improper behaviors\\n\\nas a first line of offense on any health goal.\\n\\nSo now you know how to set your baseline levels of dopamine\\n\\nat the highest possible level.\\n\\nYou, of course, want to guard that baseline level\\n\\nof dopamine very carefully.\\n\\nSo for instance, you want to avoid any kind of behaviors\\n\\nor substances that are going to peak your baseline level\\n\\nof dopamine very high or very sharply.\\n\\nOr if you do engage in those types of behaviors,\\n\\nwhatever they may be, that you are well aware\\n\\nthat your baseline level of dopamine will drop\\n\\nfar below what it was after that peak has fallen.\\n\\nYou will be essentially in the quote unquote trough.\\n\\nIf, however, you find yourself in that trough,\\n\\nyou now have the knowledge to understand\\n\\nthat that trough will resolve if you wait enough time.\\n\\nThat baseline level of dopamine that you were at\\n\\nprior to the peak will come back.\\n\\nYou will feel better.\\n\\nHowever, most people don't know that.\\n\\nAnd as a consequence, when they feel that low,\\n\\nthat is they feel kind of a-motivated,\\n\\nmaybe a little bit depressed,\\n\\nmaybe a lot a-motivated or a lot depressed\\n\\nfollowing some quote unquote peak experience.\\n\\nWhat they end up doing is thinking about\\n\\nwhat caused that peak experience and then go back\\n\\nand try to re-engage in the behavior\\n\\nand try and regenerate that peak experience.\\n\\nBut you now know that that is a terrible strategy.\\n\\nIn fact, that strategy will only lead to diminished peaks\\n\\nfrom the same experience.\\n\\nIt will lead to, in many cases,\\n\\npursuing more and more intense experiences\\n\\nto try and recapitulate, recreate that big peak,\\n\\nwhich won't work, or even worse,\\n\\npeople start stacking and combining\\n\\ndifferent dopamine-increasing behaviors\\n\\nin order to try and obtain something like that initial peak\\n\\nwhen in fact, all they need to do,\\n\\nall you need to do is simply wait\\n\\nbecause the way that the dopamine circuitry is arranged\\n\\nis that it's not just about pleasure, as you know,\\n\\nit's about motivation, desire, pursuit, and pleasure,\\n\\nand it also has everything to do with pain and discomfort.\\n\\nNow, when people hear the word pain, they often think,\\n\\noh, pain, okay, so a physical pain\\n\\nor an intense emotional pain.\\n\\nBut today, we're going to talk about pain\\n\\na little bit differently.\\n\\nWe're going to talk about the pain associated\\n\\nwith the trough in dopamine\\n\\nthat occurs after a big peak in dopamine\\n\\nas a period in which pain and effort go hand in hand.\\n\\nAnd I'll return to this in a moment,\\n\\nbut I want you to just note that in your mind,\\n\\nkind of earmark that in your mind,\\n\\nbecause what we're about to talk about\\n\\nis how to leverage that pain and to use effort\\n\\nas a way to not just get out of the trough more quickly,\\n\\nbut actually to get back to a higher level of baseline\\n\\nas you exit that trough.\\n\\nMeanwhile, I really want to harp on this one point\\n\\nthat I made a moment ago,\\n\\nwhich is that after some big experience,\\n\\nso it could be a vacation or a night out partying\\n\\nor the birth of a new child.\\n\\nAll of these are well-known phenomena\\n\\nthat lead to troughs or deficits in dopamine afterwards,\\n\\nwhich can cause a sort of postpartum depression.\\n\\nPostpartum depression is a phrase normally used\\n\\nto describe literally postpartum,\\n\\npostbirth of a child depression.\\n\\nAnd that has many causes,\\n\\nnot just related to dopamine baselines,\\n\\nalthough it does involve dopamine baselines,\\n\\nbut it has hormonal aspects and other aspects as well.\\n\\nBut postpartum depression is also used to describe\\n\\nany time that our baseline dopamine has gone down\\n\\nway, way below what it was prior to some recent peak\\n\\nor exciting, exhilarating win or behavior.\\n\\nA couple of things that one can do\\n\\nin order to get out of that trough more quickly.\\n\\nThe first one is simply to wait\\n\\nwith the understanding that you will get out.\\n\\nI know that sounds overly simplistic\\n\\nand maybe a little bit brutal,\\n\\nbut I think most people don't realize this.\\n\\nThey don't realize that the dopamine circuitry\\n\\ndoes take time to replenish and it has everything to do\\n\\nwith restoring both the synthesis of dopamine\\n\\nas well as what's called\\n\\nthe readily releasable pool of dopamine.\\n\\nSo dopamine is packaged in these little spherical things\\n\\nthat we call vesicles.\\n\\nThose vesicles are released from the ends of nerves.\\n\\nSo in this case, we're talking about the nerves\\n\\nthat originate again in VTA and nucleus accumbens\\n\\nand send their little wires up to the prefrontal cortex.\\n\\nAnd that's where dopamine is released.\\n\\nAnd that readily releasable pool of dopamine\\n\\ntakes time to replenish.\\n\\nAnd that can take several days in order to replenish.\\n\\nJust knowing that can help you through that process.\\n\\nAnd of course, then it raises the question,\\n\\nis there anything that you can do\\n\\nto accelerate that process?\\n\\nAnd indeed there is.\\n\\nAnd indeed, this is what I consider,\\n\\nnot just something to get you out of a trench\\n\\nof kind of lower mood and motivation,\\n\\nbut actually what represents the holy grail of motivation.\\n\\nToday, I'm going to talk about this pain effort process\\n\\nas a very powerful way to get out of sticking points,\\n\\nbut more importantly, to get into a mode\\n\\nwhere effort and reward can actually accelerate\\n\\nyour progress along any path to any goal\\n\\nand in a way that you can do it repeatedly.\\n\\nAnd this is not simply taking mechanisms from biology\\n\\nand painting names on them.\\n\\nRather, this is leveraging mechanisms in biology\\n\\nthat are well-defined in the animal and human literature\\n\\nthat have parallels to the addiction\\n\\nand addiction recovery literature,\\n\\nbut that have been shown in specific circumstances\\n\\nto really allow people to engage in motivational pursuits\\n\\nin a variety of contexts,\\n\\nschool, relationships, work, et cetera,\\n\\nin an ongoing way and in a way that never depletes\\n\\ntheir baseline of dopamine to the point\\n\\nwhere they have to do a lot of extra work to get it back\\n\\nand in a way that allows them to be really motivated\\n\\nin a variety of contexts in an adaptive way.\\n\\nSo what we're really talking about here\\n\\nis regardless of your genetics,\\n\\nregardless of who your parents are,\\n\\nwhich obviously you couldn't select,\\n\\nbeing able to leverage your dopamine system\\n\\nin order to be maximally motivated when you want to be\\n\\nand indeed to avoid procrastination.\\n\\nI'd like to tell you about a classic experiment\\n\\nthat I've described once before in this podcast,\\n\\nbut frankly, this experiment is so crucial.\\n\\nI don't think it can be described enough.\\n\\nThis was an experiment that was done at Stanford\\n\\nmany years ago and involved children,\\n\\nbut it's actually been repeated in adults.\\n\\nThe experiment involved observing a classroom\\n\\nof young children.\\n\\nSo these were kids about kindergarten age,\\n\\na little bit older and observing which activities kids\\n\\nlike to do in their free time.\\n\\nSo their structured time where they had to,\\n\\nthese are little kids, so they play blocks\\n\\nor they had to sing or they had to write\\n\\nor do what they could or I suppose draw.\\n\\nThey're probably not writing significant prose at that age,\\n\\nbut then they had free time where they could do\\n\\nwhatever they wanted.\\n\\nAnd what the researchers did was observe the children\\n\\nwho selected by their own choice to draw pictures.\\n\\nSo there were some tables out with crayons and markers\\n\\nand paper, et cetera.\\n\\nAnd there were some kids that would just naturally\\n\\ngo to that activity every day\\n\\nbecause they liked that activity.\\n\\nAnd they measured how much of the free time\\n\\nthese children elected to use their free time drawing,\\n\\ndoing these different art projects.\\n\\nAnd then what they did was they started introducing rewards\\n\\nto these children.\\n\\nThey started putting a gold star or in some cases,\\n\\na silver star on their pieces of artwork\\n\\nand telling them what a good job they did.\\n\\nAnd the kids really liked that.\\n\\nIn fact, who wouldn't, right?\\n\\nThey're not only doing an activity that they like,\\n\\nbut they're also getting a reward for it.\\n\\nSo you can probably see where this is all going.\\n\\nWhat they were doing was they were increasing\\n\\nthe amount of dopamine that these children experience.\\n\\nAnd again, in parallel experiments done with adults,\\n\\nif you take adults who enjoy a particular activity,\\n\\nyou let them do activity\\n\\nand then you start rewarding them for that activity,\\n\\nespecially when you surprise them with a reward\\n\\nfor an activity they already like.\\n\\nThey report that being a much more pleasurable experience\\n\\nthan had they just done the activity.\\n\\nThen what they did with these children\\n\\nand in the experiments with adults done later on\\n\\nwas they cease giving them the reward.\\n\\nAnd then they observed what percentage of their free time\\n\\nthey spend doing that activity drawing.\\n\\nAnd what they observed was, you guessed it,\\n\\na drop in the total amount of time\\n\\nthat the children elected to do this activity\\n\\nthat initially they were doing quite a lot.\\n\\nIn other words, their total satisfaction or desire\\n\\nor motivation to engage in this activity\\n\\ndropped below what it was prior to ever receiving a reward.\\n\\nAnd again, this has been repeated in a variety of contexts\\n\\nand different populations, different cultures,\\n\\ndifferent countries, men, women, boys, girls,\\n\\nlots of different backgrounds.\\n\\nSo what this tells us is everything you already know,\\n\\nwhich is that reward prediction error\\n\\nis not just about the desire to do something\\n\\nand you carrying it out and it being pretty good,\\n\\namazing, or not good, okay?\\n\\nI always like to joke that the nervous system\\n\\nsort of codes things into three bins.\\n\\nYou can think about this in terms of food\\n\\nor any type of experience.\\n\\nIt can either be yum, yes, I really like that,\\n\\nyuck, I really don't like that,\\n\\nor meh, it's kind of so-so.\\n\\nWhat the scenario led to where rewards were received\\n\\nfor an activity that people already liked to do\\n\\nand then removed was that an activity\\n\\nthat at one point was a yum becomes a meh.\\n\\nAnd that all reflects a drop in baseline dopamine, why?\\n\\nBecause the activity that the children or adults liked\\n\\ncombined with the gold star or the monetary reward\\n\\nor praise that children and adults seem to like\\n\\ncompounded to create a bigger peak in dopamine\\n\\nand therefore a bigger trough in dopamine.\\n\\nAnd if you're already wondering whether or not\\n\\ntheir desire to engage in that activity\\n\\neventually came back, it did indeed.\\n\\nSo essentially what I described all matches precisely\\n\\nwith dopamine reward prediction error\\n\\nand the fact that peaks in dopamine\\n\\ngive rise to subsequent troughs in dopamine\\n\\nthat if one waits long enough,\\n\\nallow baseline levels of dopamine to return to normal.\\n\\nAnd of course, the amplitude of that dopamine peak\\n\\nhas been varied by giving more money or less money\\n\\nin different scenarios.\\n\\nNearly all the different derivations of the experiments\\n\\nthat you could imagine that map onto the dynamics\\n\\nof dopamine release that we've been talking about\\n\\nduring this episode all played out exactly\\n\\nas one would have predicted based on the neural circuitry\\n\\nand the dynamics of dopamine.\\n\\nI recommend that you leverage this knowledge\\n\\nto make sure that any activities that you enjoy to do,\\n\\nwhether or not you enjoy it a little or a lot,\\n\\nbut especially if you enjoy it a lot,\\n\\nthat you guard and protect by making sure\\n\\nthat you don't start layering in or attaching reward\\n\\nor other sources of dopamine releasing behaviors\\n\\nor substances to that specific behavior.\\n\\nOr if you do, that you don't do it terribly often.\\n\\nNow, how often is terribly often?\\n\\nWe'll get to that in a moment.\\n\\nBut let me give you an example from my life\\n\\njust as an example, but you will likely have\\n\\nand you'll know people that will have different examples.\\n\\nI love to exercise.\\n\\nI know to some people this might seem foreign,\\n\\nbut I love to exercise.\\n\\nI love to do resistance training.\\n\\nI love to run.\\n\\nI am not one of those people\\n\\nthat doesn't like the experience of exercising,\\n\\nbut likes the feeling afterwards, quote unquote.\\n\\nI hear that a lot.\\n\\nI don't like to exercise,\\n\\nbut I love the way I feel afterwards.\\n\\nI love physical training\\n\\nand I love the way I feel afterwards,\\n\\nbut I mostly love the feeling during.\\n\\nI don't know why I'm wired that way.\\n\\nI can't say that I'm somebody\\n\\nwho likes to do hard things across the board.\\n\\nThere are plenty of difficult things in life that I dread\\n\\nor that I'm sort of meh about.\\n\\nBut for me, hard exercise, intense exercise\\n\\nof a particular kind, resistance training\\n\\nand running in particular, both give me a yum.\\n\\nYes, I love this kind of feeling.\\n\\nAnd yes, it persists for me quite a long while afterwards,\\n\\nboth for sake of the way that it changes my neurochemistry,\\n\\nbut also my sense of satisfaction,\\n\\nbut I just simply love it.\\n\\nNow, years ago, I discovered that if I drink\\n\\na cup of black coffee or an Americano\\n\\nor a double espresso or some yerba mate,\\n\\nthat my workouts can be quite a bit more intense.\\n\\nI can run further.\\n\\nAnd then I also discovered\\n\\nthat if I were to take a pre-workout energy drink\\n\\nor I took say 300 milligrams of alpha GPC\\n\\nand 500 milligrams of phenol ethylamine\\n\\nand perhaps even 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine\\n\\nand perhaps did that alongside the caffeine\\n\\nand the yerba mate, then yes, absolutely.\\n\\nI really liked those workouts.\\n\\nI could be like a laser in terms of focus.\\n\\nI could exert even more effort, put on some music\\n\\nand I could achieve even better performance.\\n\\nAnd then I also discovered that I could export\\n\\nthat protocol of caffeine, yerba mate\\n\\nand various supplements to my cognitive work.\\n\\nSo when I was studying or writing papers\\n\\nor writing grants or in the laboratory,\\n\\nwhen I was doing experiments with my hands in those days,\\n\\ncutting brain tissue and staining it\\n\\nand working really long hours,\\n\\nand I discovered that all of those things,\\n\\nall of those behaviors compounded\\n\\nwith my love of exercise and my love of doing science\\n\\nand gave me these big peaks\\n\\nin what to me felt like even important experiences.\\n\\nThey felt unlike anything else.\\n\\nThey were just so, so peak in their nature, which was great.\\n\\nAnd it did indeed enhance my performance.\\n\\nHowever, while it did not create a dependency\\n\\nfor those different substances,\\n\\ncaffeine, supplements, et cetera,\\n\\nwhat I noticed was that in the days\\n\\nand sometimes weekends afterwards,\\n\\neven though for much of my career,\\n\\nI confess I've worked weekends as well,\\n\\nbut I would notice that I'd experienced\\n\\na real trough in energy.\\n\\nI just would not feel that good.\\n\\nAnd then if I kept up those behaviors consistently\\n\\nand I was consistently adding in these other,\\n\\nlet's just call them what they are,\\n\\ndopamine releasing or stimulating behaviors and substances\\n\\nthat my enthusiasm for physical training or running\\n\\nor for doing experiments actually started to diminish.\\n\\nAnd this was really discouraging to me at the time\\n\\nbecause I started to think, okay, maybe I'm burnt out.\\n\\nMaybe I have adrenal burnout,\\n\\nwhich by the way, doesn't exist folks.\\n\\nYour adrenals don't burn out.\\n\\nThere is something called adrenal insufficiency syndrome.\\n\\nYou can over-stimulate your system\\n\\nby way of too much adrenaline, epinephrine\\n\\nand norepinephrine, but that's a separate thing.\\n\\nThere's no such thing as adrenal burnout per se.\\n\\nBut I didn't know that.\\n\\nSo I thought, gosh, I'm really burnt out.\\n\\nWhen in fact, it's now obvious to me what I was doing.\\n\\nI was combining too many dopamine releasing\\n\\nor stimulating behaviors and substances\\n\\nfor things that I already enjoy doing as behaviors,\\n\\nnamely exercise and doing experiments,\\n\\nanything related to science actually.\\n\\nSo what this means is not to avoid taking things\\n\\nor doing things that amplify your amount of dopamine,\\n\\nbut to be very cautious about how often one does that\\n\\nand how many different dopamine stimulating behaviors\\n\\nor compounds one stacks,\\n\\nespecially in terms of taking those things\\n\\nor stacking those things in and around behaviors\\n\\nthat you already really enjoy doing.\\n\\nI was essentially just creating another version\\n\\nof the kids in nursery school or first grade\\n\\nwith the gold star experiment.\\n\\nI was basically just doing the exact same thing.\\n\\nAnd when I realized that,\\n\\nand I changed my relationship to those compounds,\\n\\nI didn't eliminate them altogether,\\n\\nbut I started realizing, for instance,\\n\\nthat I didn't need to double up on yerba mate\\n\\nand coffee every workout.\\n\\nSometimes I would do one, sometimes I would do the other.\\n\\nFrankly, I always do one or the other.\\n\\nIt's rare that I ever do any kind of physical training\\n\\nwithout some caffeine first.\\n\\nAnd I do my physical training\\n\\ntypically in the early part of the day.\\n\\nSo that's fine, doesn't interfere with my sleep.\\n\\nI might do a hike without caffeine,\\n\\nbut if I'm in a weight trainer, I'm going to run.\\n\\nI tend to drink coffee beforehand or have yerba mate.\\n\\nOr if I occasionally, meaning about once every third,\\n\\nsometimes every other,\\n\\nbut usually about every third workout,\\n\\nI'll take 300 milligrams of alpha GPC,\\n\\nmaybe occasionally, maybe every third or fourth workout.\\n\\nAnd these are resistance workouts, mind you, not running.\\n\\nI'll take 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine\\n\\nor more typically 500 milligrams of phenolethylamine.\\n\\nAnd very, very rarely,\\n\\nmaybe once every two or three months,\\n\\nI might stack all of those things together\\n\\nprior to a workout.\\n\\nBut of course, I'm always mindful\\n\\nto also include workouts or runs or bouts of cognitive work.\\n\\nSo that could be grant writing, prepping for a podcast,\\n\\net cetera, where I don't do anything prior.\\n\\nMaybe just my caffeine,\\n\\nbecause I have a baseline level of caffeine\\n\\nthat I use each day to function like many people.\\n\\nThere's a baseline level of caffeine\\n\\nthat just allows us to function\\n\\nif we're a perpetual user of caffeine.\\n\\nI talked a lot about this on the episode in caffeine.\\n\\nBut the key here is be cautious.\\n\\nI would say be very cautious about stacking and layering\\n\\nin too many dopamine peak inducing behaviors\\n\\nall at once on a regular basis.\\n\\nThe key point here is if you are somebody\\n\\nthat can engage in these intrinsically joyful activities\\n\\nfor you, these activities that you're really motivated to do,\\n\\nwhether or not it's skiing or playing music\\n\\nor dancing, et cetera,\\n\\nwithout the need to layer in additional dopamine\\n\\nreleasing mechanisms or compounds or activities,\\n\\nwell, then I highly recommend you do that\\n\\nbecause then you are essentially making yourself\\n\\none of those fortunate few\\n\\nthat does not require additional stimuli\\n\\nand therefore can hold onto that pleasure,\\n\\ncan hold onto that intrinsic pleasure and motivation\\n\\nto engage in these behaviors over time,\\n\\nwhich frankly, there is no replacement for.\\n\\nThere is no pill or bottle or potion\\n\\nor motivational speech or podcast or book\\n\\nthat can replace intrinsic motivation.\\n\\nIntrinsic motivation is perhaps the holy grail\\n\\nof all human endeavors and behaviors\\n\\nbecause it encompasses so much of what brought us\\n\\nto this point in our species evolution\\n\\nand also what brings each and every one of us\\n\\ncloser and closer to our goals.\\n\\nAnd if it's happening with enjoyment\\n\\nwithout the need to layer in additional tools,\\n\\nwell, then you have really tapped into the source.\\n\\nAnd when I say the source,\\n\\nI don't mean it in any kind of mystical way.\\n\\nI think it's quite clear by now\\n\\nthat when we hear about chi from Eastern medicine,\\n\\nor we talk about motivation drive and pursuit\\n\\nin Western neurobiological languages\\n\\nthat relates to dopamine,\\n\\nor we hear about the source,\\n\\nmaybe in my podcast episode\\n\\nwith the one and only Rick Rubin,\\n\\nincredibly productive music producer,\\n\\nwho's just an unbelievable track record\\n\\nin terms of creative endeavors.\\n\\nAnd he talks about the source.\\n\\nWe're really talking about the same thing,\\n\\nwhich is this set of circuits within us\\n\\nthat allow us to identify what we want\\n\\nand then lean into effort\\n\\nand then to do that in a persistent way\\n\\nthat allows us to reach our goals.\\n\\nAnd if we can do that with an intrinsic sense of pleasure,\\n\\nwell, that is nothing short of magic.\\n\\nBut of course, it's not magic, it's science.\\n\\nAnd of course, most people are not concerned\\n\\nabout trying to protect the things they already enjoy\\n\\nin order to make sure that they can continue\\n\\nto do those things and enjoy them.\\n\\nMost people are thinking about how they can engage\\n\\nand pursue things that are less than pleasureful to them,\\n\\nor how they can continue to engage in motivated behaviors\\n\\nwhen the going gets tough.\\n\\nOr, and this is a big one,\\n\\nI hear this over and over again\\n\\nas a request to cover on this podcast,\\n\\nhow people can overcome procrastination.\\n\\nWhat we're going to talk about now\\n\\nis how the dynamics of dopamine release\\n\\nthat you already are aware of,\\n\\nplus an additional dynamic\\n\\nthat we haven't quite talked about\\n\\ncan allow you to leverage dopamine\\n\\nin a way that really will bring you\\n\\nto the holy grail of motivation and drive,\\n\\nwhich is when effort starts to become the reward itself.\\n\\nIn other words, when friction becomes the reward.\\n\\nI know that sounds crazy to some of you,\\n\\nbut when friction becomes the reward,\\n\\nyou can pass from an idea and a goal,\\n\\nno matter how daunting,\\n\\nto successful completion of that goal\\n\\nwhile experiencing what essentially\\n\\nwill feel like pleasure the entire time.\\n\\nNow that doesn't mean it will be bliss the entire time,\\n\\nbut what is very possible is to leverage the dynamics\\n\\nof both dopamine peaks and dopamine troughs\\n\\nin order to not just maintain your baseline level of dopamine,\\n\\nbut to also pull yourself out of any kind of procrastination\\n\\nor other kind of overthinking trenches very quickly\\n\\nand get back into a mode of pursuit.\\n\\nSo how do we make effort the reward?\\n\\nYou may have heard about this\\n\\nin the context of so-called growth mindset.\\n\\nGrowth mindset is the incredible discovery\\n\\nand research papers from my colleague,\\n\\nDr. Carol Dweck in the psychology department at Stanford.\\n\\nAnd there are others such as David Yeager\\n\\nat the University of Texas Austin\\n\\nwho have leveraged the so-called growth mindset\\n\\nas a tool that young people and adults alike\\n\\ncan use in order to get better at anything.\\n\\nAnd the basic contour of growth mindset\\n\\nis to adopt the mindset that if you can't do something\\n\\nor if you can't do it well,\\n\\nthat you can't do it or can't do it well yet.\\n\\nIt's that word yet that's really key.\\n\\nAnd there are a number of different tools and techniques\\n\\nthat people use to adopt growth mindset,\\n\\nbut it all starts with that relationship\\n\\nto not being able to do it yet.\\n\\nNow that all sounds pretty straightforward\\n\\nwhen you tell yourself,\\n\\nbut when we are in a performance context,\\n\\nwhen we expect ourselves to be able to motivate\\n\\nor when we expect ourselves to be able to perform\\n\\nand we can't, that often sets up\\n\\na downward spiral of motivation\\n\\nbecause we are so used to being attached\\n\\nto the relationship between desire,\\n\\nmotivation and outcomes, reward prediction error.\\n\\nWe want something, we want that A in class,\\n\\nor we want to learn how to dance,\\n\\nor we want to be able to do this physical skill\\n\\nof another kind or learn a language\\n\\nor get the mate we desire or make the relationship work\\n\\nor make the business work on and on.\\n\\nAnd then we get the outcome that we don't want\\n\\nand our confidence, for lack of a better word,\\n\\ndrops over time.\\n\\nOftentimes that leads to situations\\n\\nwhere we are not motivated, we are A motivated.\\n\\nIt can even lead to situations\\n\\nwhere we are downright depressed.\\n\\nThere's also circumstances where people,\\n\\nmyself included of course, procrastinate.\\n\\nWe know we should do something\\n\\nbut somehow we can't get motivated.\\n\\nWe know that if we put in the effort, we'll get there,\\n\\nbut we can't do it either\\n\\nbecause we don't like the activity\\n\\nor we're just not feeling great.\\n\\nNow we could be quote unquote, not feeling great,\\n\\nnot feeling motivated because our dopamine baseline is low.\\n\\nAnd so I absolutely encourage everybody\\n\\nto take a look at themselves\\n\\nanytime they're in a motivated state,\\n\\ntake a look at the landscape of their life,\\n\\nnot just at that moment,\\n\\nbut in the preceding days and weeks\\n\\nand ask whether or not you've been tending\\n\\nto those foundational things that we talked about earlier,\\n\\nwhether or not you are engaging any other of the tools\\n\\nthat we talked about earlier\\n\\nto see if you can get into a motivated state.\\n\\nHowever, if all of those boxes are checked,\\n\\nyou answer, yes, I'm doing all those things\\n\\nand I'm just not motivated.\\n\\nI'm just, whatever reason, I just procrastinate.\\n\\nI don't know, I don't want to do it\\n\\nor I'm not feeling motivated.\\n\\nWell, then there's a very potent set of tools\\n\\nthat you can leverage to overcome states\\n\\nof lack of motivation, overcome procrastination\\n\\nand indeed can help you deal with things like overthinking\\n\\nas it relates to procrastination\\n\\nand lack of motivation as well.\\n\\nSo the way this works is the following.\\n\\nIf you recall, a peak in dopamine\\n\\nis followed by a trough in dopamine.\\n\\nThat trough in dopamine is experienced as pain\\n\\nor wanting or craving.\\n\\nThat pain that I'm referring to\\n\\nis actually a craving or a wanting\\n\\nand it's a craving or wanting for a specific state\\n\\nthat you would like to achieve\\n\\nthat is different than the one that you're in.\\n\\nYou want to get out of that trough.\\n\\nAnd as you recall from earlier in the episode,\\n\\nthat trough is the stimulus\\n\\nfor the ongoing release of dopamine\\n\\nthat provides the propeller,\\n\\nthe motivation to go forward and seek some goal, okay?\\n\\nSo when we are not motivated,\\n\\nwhen we are in a so-called a motivated state\\n\\nor when we are procrastinating\\n\\nor when we just sort of can't seem to get in gear,\\n\\nthe key to getting out of that pain trough\\n\\nis one of two things.\\n\\nI already told you earlier, you can just wait.\\n\\nYou can wait till your motivation comes back.\\n\\nAnd a lot of people do wait.\\n\\nIn fact, they procrastinate.\\n\\nThey start doing other things that are less painful\\n\\nthan the state that they happen to be in\\n\\nwhen they are trying to get into gear to go work out.\\n\\nCause I realized not everyone wants to do that\\n\\nor to study or to have a hard conversations,\\n\\nwhatever it is.\\n\\nAnd what do they do?\\n\\nThey start engaging in activities that we and indeed they\\n\\nwould not consider pleasureful activities.\\n\\nThey start, for instance, cleaning the house.\\n\\nSo seemingly out of nowhere,\\n\\nthey start engaging in these activities\\n\\nthat normally are not intrinsically pleasureful for them.\\n\\nThey're not highly motivated to do them\\n\\nas a replacement for doing the very thing\\n\\nthat they quote unquote need to do or ought to do\\n\\nand that they're procrastinating to do.\\n\\nWhat they're essentially doing here\\n\\nis a mild type of addiction replacement.\\n\\nIn other words, rather than be in the painful state\\n\\nand wait for it to pass,\\n\\nthey're doing things that give them\\n\\nsome sense of accomplishment ostensibly\\n\\nto give them the sense that they're completing things.\\n\\nAnd perhaps, and I don't know,\\n\\nbecause I'm not in the psychology\\n\\nof knowing what other people are thinking,\\n\\nperhaps in order to generate the momentum\\n\\nin order to get engaged enough or motivated enough\\n\\nto study or work out or whatever activity it is\\n\\nthat they're trying to avoid through procrastination.\\n\\nNow, what's interesting about this dynamic is,\\n\\nfirst of all, it's extremely common.\\n\\nAnd second of all,\\n\\na lot of people will use this as a tactic\\n\\nso that they get very close to the deadline\\n\\nto complete something\\n\\nand then they go into a sort of pseudo panic\\n\\nand then use anxiety as a way to leverage\\n\\ntheir mental and physical resources to complete that thing.\\n\\nHow do I know the contour of this so well?\\n\\nHow do I understand the inner dynamics of it?\\n\\nWell, part of that relates to my work as a neurobiologist\\n\\nin reading the papers that I'll mention to you in a moment,\\n\\nbut it also relates to the fact that I am somebody\\n\\nwho waits quite a while,\\n\\nright up until the sort of last minute possible\\n\\nto complete something for activities that I don't want to do,\\n\\nsomething I've been working on my whole life.\\n\\nIn any case, I'm very familiar\\n\\nwith the procrastination process.\\n\\nSo how can we overcome procrastination?\\n\\nWell, it turns out that there are findings\\n\\nfrom within the addiction literature\\n\\nthat turn out to be very powerful\\n\\ntowards leveraging our way out of procrastination.\\n\\nAnd it has to do with this.\\n\\nYou already know, because I've told you\\n\\nprobably a dozen times now,\\n\\nthat the depth of the trough after a dopamine peak\\n\\nis proportional to how high that peak was\\n\\nand how steep it was, how quickly that peak occurred.\\n\\nIt turns out that not only is the depth of the trough\\n\\nproportional to that,\\n\\nbut the rate at which you get out of that trough\\n\\nis proportional to how steep that trough is.\\n\\nLet me explain this for you\\n\\nin as clear terms as I possibly can.\\n\\nImagine you're in an A-motivated state.\\n\\nYou're just not feeling motivated, you're procrastinating.\\n\\nYou may think, okay, the thing to do here is something.\\n\\nI'll clean the house, I'll take care of some bills,\\n\\nI'll do something, or I'll just wait.\\n\\nThose approaches, as we talked about before,\\n\\ngenerally don't work or at least don't work quickly,\\n\\nor they lead you right up to the deadline\\n\\nand that's the deadline that forces you\\n\\nto get something done, or you just don't get it done\\n\\nand you don't succeed in your goal.\\n\\nThat happens a lot as well.\\n\\nHowever, if you were to take that state\\n\\nof being unmotivated, of procrastinating,\\n\\nand actually do something that's harder\\n\\nthan being in that A-motivated state,\\n\\nin other words, doing something that's more effortful,\\n\\neven painful, you can rebound yourself\\n\\nout of that dopamine trough much more quickly.\\n\\nSo what do I mean you want to put yourself\\n\\nin a state that's worse than or harder\\n\\nthan the state that you're in,\\n\\nor do something quote unquote more painful?\\n\\nAnd here I want to be very clear.\\n\\nI'll say this three times,\\n\\nbut I'm going to say it for the first time now.\\n\\nWhen I say more painful, I do not mean doing any kind\\n\\nof tissue damaging or psychologically damaging behavior\\n\\nor anything of that sort that's going to render you injured\\n\\nor not well, even in the short term.\\n\\nThat's not what I'm referring to, okay?\\n\\nLet's just get that one out of the way.\\n\\nWhat I'm referring to is the fact that, for instance,\\n\\nif you're feeling A-motivated,\\n\\nbut you find yourself cleaning the house\\n\\nas a way to procrastinate, you can say,\\n\\nwell, cleaning the house is harder\\n\\nthan sitting down and doing nothing.\\n\\nBut actually in that moment or in those moments,\\n\\nthat's not the case, or else you wouldn't be doing it.\\n\\nThe reality is that the dopamine system works according\\n\\nto what feels hard or easy in the moment.\\n\\nIn other words, if you're feeling A-motivated,\\n\\nyou need to do something and put yourself into a state\\n\\nthat's harder than the state you're in.\\n\\nSo for instance, if you're sitting around feeling\\n\\nA-motivated or you find yourself tending to tasks\\n\\nthat are irrelevant to the goal\\n\\nthat you really should be focused on,\\n\\nyou need to put your body and mind\\n\\ninto a state of discomfort quickly.\\n\\nAnd the way to do that is to either engage\\n\\nin some tangential activity, meaning an activity not related\\n\\nto your goal, that puts your body\\n\\ninto a very different state.\\n\\nSo here again, I'll default to the obvious one,\\n\\nwhich is something like cold shower or cold immersion,\\n\\nwhich not only increases dopamine long-term\\n\\nor over several hours rather,\\n\\nbut for most people is experienced as pain.\\n\\nThat pain causes a rebound out of that dopamine trough faster\\n\\nthan it would occur if you had just stayed\\n\\nin that A-motivated state and waited for it to go away\\n\\nor done something like cleaning up that for whatever reason\\n\\nfelt like it required less friction.\\n\\nWhen I say friction, I mean limbic friction.\\n\\nYour limbic system is always in this dialogue\\n\\nwith your forebrain and limbic friction goes two ways.\\n\\nLimbic friction can be you're tired\\n\\nand you don't want to do something.\\n\\nAnd so you have to quote unquote, motivate to do it,\\n\\nenergize yourself to do it.\\n\\nOr limbic friction can be that you're nervous\\n\\nand scared and anxious to do something\\n\\nand you have to calm yourself in order to lean forward\\n\\ninto action in order to do that thing despite the anxiety.\\n\\nI realize this can be a little bit confusing\\n\\nas a concept, so I want to go into a bit more detail.\\n\\nLet's imagine that you or somebody else\\n\\ndoes not like to exercise.\\n\\nYou don't want to exercise and you're trying to get\\n\\nyour minimum of five days per week exercise\\n\\nand you're just not motivated to do it.\\n\\nThere are a couple of different techniques to doing this.\\n\\nAssuming you've taken care of all the baseline stuff,\\n\\nall the foundational stuff we talked about earlier\\n\\nand you're just not getting in gear\\n\\nand you find yourself checking your phone\\n\\nor maybe you're tending to some tasks,\\n\\nobviously those things are quote unquote easier for you,\\n\\nmeaning they cause less limbic friction\\n\\nthan engaging in exercise.\\n\\nThe typical advice would be just exercise for one minute.\\n\\nOkay, just get one minute of exercise or five minutes\\n\\nand then use the successful completion\\n\\nof that one or five minutes as a milestone\\n\\nthat allows you to then move to the next milestone.\\n\\nAnd indeed that approach can work\\n\\nand it's exactly what I'm describing here\\n\\nwhen I say that you're in a state of lack of motivation\\n\\nor procrastination or both.\\n\\nAnd you need to put yourself into a more painful,\\n\\nnot less painful state.\\n\\nSo what do you do?\\n\\nYou push up against that friction\\n\\nand you exercise for a short while\\n\\nand then that pops you out of that trough.\\n\\nThat's possible, but for a lot of people,\\n\\neven that won't be possible\\n\\nbecause they just can't get motivated\\n\\nor they do that one minute or five minutes\\n\\nand they're just like, okay, I'm still in the trough.\\n\\nI'm not actually feeling that great.\\n\\nIn those circumstances, it makes sense to do something\\n\\nthat's tangential to the whole path\\n\\nthat you're trying to pursue,\\n\\nthis goal that you're trying to pursue.\\n\\nThat is, believe it or not,\\n\\nmuch worse than just being a motivated.\\n\\nAnd when I say worse, I don't mean picking some task\\n\\nthat normally you don't like to do,\\n\\nbut now you're willing to do.\\n\\nI mean, literally thinking about what would be worse\\n\\nthan being in this state.\\n\\nAgain, without causing yourself tissue\\n\\nor psychological damage, what would be worse?\\n\\nWell, cold water would be worse for many people,\\n\\nvery cold water.\\n\\nSo the key is to figure out something\\n\\nthat for lack of a better way to put it,\\n\\nreally sucks, really sucks, and yet is safe.\\n\\nAnd by doing that, you steepen the trough,\\n\\nyou steepen the slope of the trough,\\n\\nwhich we know brings you back\\n\\nto your baseline level of dopamine more quickly.\\n\\nNow, for some people that will be deliberate cold exposure\\n\\nthrough cold shower, ice bath.\\n\\nAnd I have to tell you that if you're cringing\\n\\nas I say this, well, then there you go.\\n\\nYou now have a tool that you know,\\n\\nyou cringe even when you just think about,\\n\\nand therefore represents a great tool for you.\\n\\nSo if I'm procrastinating to do something\\n\\nI really need to do,\\n\\nshould I just simply wait for that procrastination\\n\\nto evaporate?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nWill it eventually evaporate?\\n\\nMaybe.\\n\\nWill a deadline eventually surface\\n\\nthat will trigger me into an anxious or activated state\\n\\nthat will allow me to complete what needs to be done?\\n\\nMaybe, hopefully.\\n\\nBut better would be to get out of that a motivated state,\\n\\nthat state of procrastination quickly.\\n\\nAnd to do so you need to leverage something that's painful.\\n\\nSo for instance, I heard a beautiful lecture recently\\n\\ndone by Dr. Anna Lemke at Stanford School of Medicine\\n\\ndiscussing dopamine and some of the things in her book\\n\\nand some newer findings as well.\\n\\nAnd somebody in the audience asked her the question,\\n\\ndoes meditation increase dopamine?\\n\\nNow, earlier we talked about how non-sleep deep rest\\n\\nand yoga nidra has been shown in the scientific literature\\n\\nto increase dopamine.\\n\\nBut I also mentioned earlier that classic forms\\n\\nof meditation, whether eyes open or eyes closed,\\n\\nso-called open monitoring or closed monitoring meditation,\\n\\nsitting there or lying there and focusing\\n\\ndoes not increase dopamine levels per se.\\n\\nHowever, for most people,\\n\\nespecially people who find it hard to meditate\\n\\nor who don't do that practice very often,\\n\\nmeditation is effortful.\\n\\nGetting into meditation and staying in meditation\\n\\nis effortful.\\n\\nSo if you find yourself in a state of procrastination,\\n\\noftentimes a brief five to 10 minute meditation\\n\\nwhere you absolutely do not allow yourself\\n\\nto do anything besides close your eyes,\\n\\nfocus on your breath.\\n\\nAnd when your mind drifts, get back to your breath\\n\\nis not only extremely difficult and extremely frustrating\\n\\nunless you're a well-practiced meditator,\\n\\nbut it's often difficult and frustrating\\n\\nnot just to do, but to get into that practice.\\n\\nAnd not just to get into that practice,\\n\\nbut to maintain that practice\\n\\nfor that mere five to 10 minutes\\n\\nbecause it's just not a natural state for us to be in.\\n\\nWe have to force ourselves.\\n\\nSo it is effortful.\\n\\nIn fact, it qualifies as a basically available\\n\\nalmost anywhere, anytime type of effortful activity\\n\\nthat if you dislike it,\\n\\nperhaps even as much as some people dislike\\n\\ndeliberate cold exposure, well then perfect.\\n\\nYou now have an additional tool in your kit\\n\\nthat you can use anytime you are feeling\\n\\na motivated and procrastinating.\\n\\nNow there are numerous examples I could give\\n\\nand hopefully there are numerous examples\\n\\nthat you're thinking about.\\n\\nThe key is to have a short list\\n\\nof about five different effortful,\\n\\nAKA painful activities that you can employ\\n\\nanytime you're feeling a motivated\\n\\nor in a state of procrastination.\\n\\nKeeping in mind that the goal is not what you accomplish\\n\\ninside of that activity.\\n\\nAlthough it is important\\n\\nthat you actually engage in that activity.\\n\\nI actually have to make myself meditate\\n\\nin that five to 10 minute bout\\n\\nof effortful or painful activity.\\n\\nBut it's not about achieving an outcome.\\n\\nIt's about forcing your body and mind\\n\\ninto a deeper state of pain and discomfort.\\n\\nIn other words, taking yourself from that trough\\n\\nthat you're already in\\n\\nand steepening and deepening that trough.\\n\\nBecause in steepening and deepening that trough,\\n\\nwe know that the return from that trough\\n\\nto normal and even elevated levels of baseline dopamine\\n\\nis going to be faster and more robust.\\n\\nAnd in doing that,\\n\\nyou will quickly find yourself back into a motivated state.\\n\\nBecause not only does it teach you\\n\\nthat doing hard things is possible,\\n\\nthat's sort of a more of a subjective cognitive learning,\\n\\nbut it actually taps into the very neurochemical system\\n\\nthat allows you to then feel motivated and capable\\n\\nto pursue the larger goal,\\n\\nwhich is the thing you're really concerned about after all.\\n\\nSo as is often the case,\\n\\nperhaps always the case on this podcast,\\n\\nwe covered a lot of material.\\n\\nWe covered dopamine and what it is.\\n\\nWe talked about the circuitry\\n\\nand the different kinds of circuitry,\\n\\nfocusing mainly on this mesocortical pathway\\n\\nthat is so vitally important to motivation for any goals.\\n\\nTalked about the relationship\\n\\nbetween peaks and troughs and baselines\\n\\nand the foundational tools that allow us to set\\n\\nand maintain a healthy baseline level of dopamine,\\n\\nas well as ways to protect that baseline level of dopamine.\\n\\nAnd we talked about how to get ourselves\\n\\nout of states of procrastination and a motivation\\n\\nby not just waiting out those troughs and dopamine,\\n\\nbut actually making those troughs and dopamine steeper\\n\\nby engaging in things that are effortful\\n\\nand things that we really don't want to do in those moments.\\n\\nProvided that those things are safe,\\n\\nwe can get out of those dopamine troughs more quickly\\n\\nand back to our dopamine baseline or even above baseline.\\n\\nAnd we talked about what I really view\\n\\nas the holy grail of motivation,\\n\\nwhich is to be able to learn to attach reward\\n\\nto the effort process itself and to do so\\n\\nby not just understanding,\\n\\nbut also learning to subjectively recognize\\n\\nand somatically experience release\\n\\nof these different stressful chemicals within our body.\\n\\nI realized this was a lot of information\\n\\nand yet throughout I've tried to highlight tools\\n\\nthat you can use that range from behavioral\\n\\nto nutritional, supplementation tools, cognitive tools.\\n\\nAnd keep in mind that all of these different segments\\n\\nof the podcast as always are timestamps.\\n\\nSo if you feel the need to go back and listen\\n\\nto any of these in order to get clearer understanding,\\n\\nwe've made that easy to do so.\\n\\nSo simply look for the

       " Document(page_content=\"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\n\\nwhere we discuss science\\n\\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\\n\\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\\n\\nand I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology\\n\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\n\\nToday, we're discussing water.\\n\\nNow, to some of you, water might seem like a boring topic,\\n\\nbut I assure you that water is anything but a boring topic.\\n\\nIn fact, water as a substance is incredibly interesting\\n\\nfor a variety of reasons that I'll explain today.\\n\\nIn fact, we are going to discuss\\n\\nthe physics and chemistry of water,\\n\\nand I promise to make it accessible to anyone and everyone,\\n\\nregardless of whether or not\\n\\nyou have a physics or chemistry background.\\n\\nAnd I will discuss how your body needs and utilizes water,\\n\\ndepending on what type of water you drink,\\n\\nthe temperature of that water, when you drink the water,\\n\\nand indeed, how you drink that water.\\n\\nNow, water is actually a pretty controversial topic.\\n\\nIn fact, in preparing for this episode,\\n\\nwhich took me several months, in fact,\\n\\nI ran into highly contradictory information\\n\\nand had to go on some real deep dives\\n\\nin order to ferret out the best\\n\\nand most accurate knowledge for you.\\n\\nI also found that there are generally two camps\\n\\nof people out there in terms of how they think about water\\n\\nand the consumption of water.\\n\\nOne camp, generally speaking,\\n\\nis of the mind that tap water is completely safe.\\n\\nPerhaps it needs a little bit of filtering,\\n\\nbut that in most areas of the world,\\n\\nif it runs out of the tap,\\n\\nand unless there's a warning sign\\n\\ndirectly above the faucet,\\n\\nthat you can drink the tap water.\\n\\nThe other camp seems to be the camp\\n\\nthat does not trust anything that comes out of the tap\\n\\nand is excited by, and in fact,\\n\\nrelies on things like reverse osmosis, deuterium depleted,\\n\\nhydrogen rich, or other forms of water\\n\\nthat sometimes can be very expensive\\n\\nor at least involve some substantial steps\\n\\nin order to clean, filter, alter the chemistry of,\\n\\nor in some other way, adjust\\n\\nbefore they are willing to consume it.\\n\\nSo today, what we're going to try and do\\n\\nis to address all the stances around water.\\n\\nFor instance, we will discuss\\n\\nwhether or not tap water is indeed safe,\\n\\nand I will give you some tools that will allow you\\n\\nto address whether or not the water coming out of your tap\\n\\nis safe, as well as some tools that will allow you\\n\\nto address how to clean that water\\n\\nif indeed it does need filtering and cleaning,\\n\\nin particular for things like fluorides\\n\\nand endocrine disruptors,\\n\\nwhich it turns out are quite prominent in a lot, not all,\\n\\nbut a lot of tap water sources.\\n\\nI will also talk about the more, quote unquote,\\n\\nesoteric forms of water that I mentioned a few minutes ago.\\n\\nSo I will go systematically through the list\\n\\nof distilled, reverse osmosis, spring water,\\n\\ndeuterium depleted water, high pH water.\\n\\nAnd for those of you that are already screaming out\\n\\nas you hear this, oh no, he's going to tell us\\n\\nthat pH water can alter the pH of our body in helpful ways.\\n\\nI'm not going to tell you that,\\n\\nbut I will tell you that the alkalinity or acidity\\n\\nof the water, that is the pH of the water that you drink,\\n\\nhas a profound impact on your ability\\n\\nto absorb and utilize that water\\n\\nand the impact that those water molecules have\\n\\non specific biological systems.\\n\\nSo it turns out pH is very important,\\n\\nbut not for the reasons\\n\\nthat you've probably heard about previously.\\n\\nI will talk about how the temperature of water\\n\\nthat you drink does indeed turn out to be important\\n\\nfor the rate of absorption of that water\\n\\nand its impact on the cells, tissues,\\n\\nand organs of your body and thereby your health.\\n\\nAnd I will talk about various zero cost\\n\\nand low cost tools that you can use\\n\\nin order to get the most out of the water that you drink.\\n\\nAnd finally, I will talk about when\\n\\nand how to hydrate your body best.\\n\\nBefore we dive into today's topic,\\n\\nI want to share with you some very interesting results\\n\\nthat were just published\\n\\non the use of deliberate cold exposure to benefit fat loss.\\n\\nNow, deliberate cold exposure is a topic\\n\\nI've covered before in this podcast.\\n\\nWe have an entire episode about that\\n\\nthat I've linked in the show note captions.\\n\\nDeliberate cold exposure can be done\\n\\nby way of cold showers or immersion in cold or ice water\\n\\nup to the neck.\\n\\nThat's typically the ways that it's done.\\n\\nIt has been shown to reduce inflammation,\\n\\nto increase metabolism.\\n\\nAnd I think some of the most exciting results\\n\\nthat have been published are the results,\\n\\ncertainly in humans, showing that deliberate cold exposure\\n\\ncan increase the release of so-called catecholamines,\\n\\nwhich are dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.\\n\\nAnd those increases in those three molecules\\n\\nare quite long lasting and lead to substantial increases\\n\\nin mood and focus throughout the day.\\n\\nNow, many people out there hear\\n\\nabout deliberate cold exposure and cringe.\\n\\nOther people hear about it and cringe\\n\\nbecause they've heard that deliberate cold exposure,\\n\\nespecially by way of immersion in water,\\n\\ncan block the adaptation\\n\\nto strength or hypertrophy training.\\n\\nWhat I mean by that is, yes, indeed,\\n\\nthere are data showing that if one gets\\n\\ninto very cold water up to the neck in the six hours,\\n\\nanytime that is, in the six hours\\n\\nafter strength or hypertrophy training,\\n\\nthat some of the strength and hypertrophy increases\\n\\nthat one would observe are blocked\\n\\nby that deliberate cold exposure.\\n\\nHowever, after six hours does not seem to be a problem.\\n\\nSo it can be done on other days,\\n\\nbesides the strength and hypertrophy training.\\n\\nIt can be done before strength and hypertrophy training.\\n\\nIt can be done after endurance work.\\n\\nAnd I should mention that it does not appear\\n\\nthat cold showers disrupt the adaptations\\n\\nto strength and hypertrophy training,\\n\\neven if they are done immediately\\n\\nafter strength or hypertrophy training.\\n\\nOkay, with that said, many people do enjoy the effects\\n\\nof deliberate cold exposure, in particular,\\n\\nfor those increases in mood and alertness\\n\\nthat are the consequence of those increases\\n\\nin the catecholamines, dopamine, norepinephrine,\\n\\nand epinephrine.\\n\\nAnd again, those increases are very long lasting.\\n\\nSo it's not just during the exposure to cold.\\n\\nIt is for several hours, up to four,\\n\\nmaybe even five or six hours, depending on how cold\\n\\nand how long the deliberate cold exposure happens to be.\\n\\nAgain, there's a lot to say and explore\\n\\nabout deliberate cold exposure.\\n\\nSo again, I'll just refer you to the episode\\n\\non deliberate cold exposure.\\n\\nIf you want to explore the mechanisms\\n\\nand the positive health outcomes,\\n\\nsome of the controversies within the data, et cetera,\\n\\nwithin that episode.\\n\\nMeanwhile, I definitely want to share with you\\n\\nthe results of this recent study that just came out.\\n\\nThe title of this study is Impact of Cold Exposure\\n\\non Life Satisfaction and Physical Composition of Soldiers.\\n\\nThe reason this study is very interesting\\n\\nis that it's one of the few studies that used,\\n\\nI should say explored both deliberate cold exposure\\n\\nby immersion in cold water,\\n\\nas well as deliberate cold exposure by way of cold showers\\n\\nas it relates to weight loss.\\n\\nNow there's already data out there\\n\\non the effects of deliberate cold exposure and metabolism.\\n\\nAnd here I'm mainly referring to the beautiful work\\n\\nof Dr. Susanna Soberg and colleagues in Scandinavia\\n\\nthat showed that people that do 11 minutes total\\n\\nof deliberate cold exposure by immersion in cold water\\n\\nup to the neck per week, so 11 minutes per week total\\n\\nspread out across some different sessions\\n\\nby way of getting into water that's uncomfortably cold\\n\\nup to the neck and then getting out\\n\\nand then doing that several times per week\\n\\nto hit that 11 minutes or more threshold.\\n\\nAnd this is very important.\\n\\nWe'll come up in a moment in the context of this new study\\n\\nand warming up not by getting into a warm shower,\\n\\nwhich is frankly what I do after my cold showers\\n\\nor getting into the ice bath or cold water immersion,\\n\\nbut rather forcing their body to warm up naturally\\n\\nby using its own metabolic abilities.\\n\\nIn those studies, they observed substantial increases\\n\\nin brown fat stores, which are fat stores\\n\\nthat you really want around the heart and clavicles,\\n\\nincreases in metabolism that were quite dramatic\\n\\nin my opinion.\\n\\nAnd that could be very beneficial for allowing people\\n\\nto feel more comfortable at cold temperatures\\n\\nwhen they're not in cold water and on and on.\\n\\nSo lots of benefits shown in that study.\\n\\nIn this study, what I thought was particularly interesting\\n\\nis again, they explored both immersion in cold water\\n\\nand cold showers and the duration of cold exposure\\n\\nthat they found led to substantial fat loss,\\n\\nespecially around the abdomen\\n\\nwas very brief, deliberate cold exposure.\\n\\nLet me give you a few details about this study.\\n\\nThe study involved 49 subjects\\n\\nthat include both males and females.\\n\\nThis is also really important.\\n\\nThe beautiful work of Susanna Soberg and colleagues\\n\\nas far as I know, only looked at males.\\n\\nThis study looked at males and females.\\n\\nThey were 19 to 30 years old\\n\\nand there basically were two groups.\\n\\nPeople are either were assigned\\n\\nto get deliberate cold exposure\\n\\nor they were not assigned to deliberate cold exposure.\\n\\nThe form of deliberate cold exposure\\n\\ninvolved one session per week of cold immersion\\n\\nin cold water up to the neck.\\n\\nAnd to just give you a sense of how cold it was,\\n\\nit was three degrees Celsius,\\n\\nwhich translates to about 37 and a half degrees Fahrenheit.\\n\\nThat's pretty darn cold, but it was only for two minutes.\\n\\nOkay, so one session at three degrees Celsius,\\n\\notherwise known as 37.4 degrees Fahrenheit\\n\\nfor two minutes every week, once a week.\\n\\nIn addition, the same subjects did five cold showers per week\\n\\nor a minimum of five cold showers per week.\\n\\nAnd those cold showers were slightly warmer\\n\\nthan the immersion in cold water condition.\\n\\nSo they were 10 degrees Celsius approximately\\n\\nor 50 degrees Fahrenheit, still pretty cold.\\n\\nAnd the duration of that cold water exposure in the shower\\n\\nwas just for 30 seconds.\\n\\nOkay, so this is interesting to me\\n\\nbecause many people don't have access\\n\\nto cold water immersion.\\n\\nThey might not have an ice bath\\n\\nor any place they can do that,\\n\\nbut most people do have access\\n\\nto a cold shower of some sort.\\n\\nPlus, I think most people could do\\n\\nprobably one ice bath per week\\n\\nor find a place where they could get\\n\\ninto cold water safely.\\n\\nNow I should point out that some people will not do well\\n\\ngoing into 37.5 degree Fahrenheit,\\n\\nAKA three degrees Celsius water,\\n\\nhaving never done anything like this before.\\n\\nSo if you're going to try and employ these sorts\\n\\nof protocols that were used in the study,\\n\\nI do recommend that you ease into it\\n\\nover the course of a week or so\\n\\nand become somewhat adapted\\n\\nto the shock of cold water exposure.\\n\\nSo maybe start at 50 degrees Fahrenheit,\\n\\nkind of ease your way back\\n\\nin terms of the cold water immersion especially.\\n\\nNow, another critical feature of this study\\n\\nis as with the beautiful work by Susanna Soberg,\\n\\nthe subjects were told to warm up naturally\\n\\nafter the deliberate cold exposure.\\n\\nSo they basically hung out outside\\n\\nof the cold water immersion\\n\\nor outside of the cold shower for 10 minutes\\n\\nafter they were exposed to the cold in their bathing suit\\n\\nor I'm assuming they were wearing something.\\n\\nBut the point is that you are not going\\n\\nfrom deliberate cold exposure directly into a hot shower\\n\\nor a sauna or something of that sort.\\n\\nSo again, their bodies were forced to heat up again,\\n\\nnaturally after the deliberate cold exposure.\\n\\nBut after the 10 minute period,\\n\\nthey were able to do whatever they wanted,\\n\\nessentially re-clothe, take a warm shower\\n\\nand so on and go about their day.\\n\\nNow the results of this deliberate cold exposure protocol,\\n\\nagain, two minutes in cold immersion\\n\\nat three degrees Celsius, 37.5 degrees Fahrenheit\\n\\nplus five cold showers per week of two minutes long,\\n\\na little bit warmer, 10 degrees Celsius, 50 degrees Fahrenheit.\\n\\nNow the deliberate cold exposure used in this study\\n\\ncaused many different statistically\\n\\nsignificant positive changes.\\n\\nThey had a very extensive questionnaire\\n\\nthat related to mood, everything from levels of anxiety\\n\\nto sexual satisfaction and on and on.\\n\\nIn fact, they saw a statistically significant improvement\\n\\nin sexual satisfaction in the subjects\\n\\nthat were exposed to deliberate cold exposure,\\n\\nnot in the control group.\\n\\nAlthough they didn't look at this,\\n\\nchances are those improvements in sexual satisfaction\\n\\nwere the downstream consequence of the known increases\\n\\nin testosterone and free testosterone\\n\\nthat occur in both men and women\\n\\nwho do the sorts of deliberate cold exposure.\\n\\nAgain, testosterone being an important hormone\\n\\nfor libido in both men and women.\\n\\nThey also saw improvements in regulation of anxiety,\\n\\nwhich I think is very interesting,\\n\\ngiven that the deliberate cold exposure\\n\\noften causes people anxiety,\\n\\nbut here and in other studies,\\n\\nwe've seen it can lead to a better ability\\n\\nto buffer against anxiety\\n\\nin the normal happenings of everyday life.\\n\\nPerhaps the most interesting and significant results\\n\\nthat they found in the study, however,\\n\\nwere that in particular in men,\\n\\nthere was a reduction in waist circumference\\n\\nfollowing eight weeks of this deliberate cold exposure,\\n\\nas well as a 5.5% on average,\\n\\n5.5% reduction in abdominal fat\\n\\nthat was quite statistically significant\\n\\nwhen compared to the other groups.\\n\\nNow, why there was no observed reduction in abdominal fat\\n\\nor waist circumference in the female subjects isn't clear,\\n\\ncould have to do with just the way\\n\\nthat body fat is stored and metabolized\\n\\nin females versus males.\\n\\nThat is going to be a topic for future exploration.\\n\\nSo I do think this study is very interesting\\n\\nbecause when you look at the landscape of science\\n\\nand discussion around deliberate cold exposure,\\n\\nI think there's a general consensus now\\n\\nthat deliberate cold exposure\\n\\ncan change one's sense of mood and wellbeing\\n\\nthrough the increases in catecholamines\\n\\nthat I mentioned earlier,\\n\\nbut the impact on metabolism itself\\n\\nhas been somewhat controversial\\n\\nbecause the overall changes in metabolism that are observed\\n\\nwhile statistically significant in many studies\\n\\nhave not ever really been shown to translate\\n\\ninto weight loss or body fat loss\\n\\nin any kind of specific way.\\n\\nAnd of course, a great advantage of this study\\n\\nis that by exploring soldiers,\\n\\nthey were able to really hold constant\\n\\na number of other features\\n\\nlike the amount of daily activity\\n\\nthat those soldiers are exposed to,\\n\\ntheir diet, their living conditions,\\n\\nand so on and so forth.\\n\\nSo at least in so far as human studies are done,\\n\\nit's a very well-controlled study.\\n\\nWe'll provide a link to the study in the show note captions.\\n\\nAnd for those of you that are thinking about\\n\\nemploying the protocol that's used in this particular paper\\n\\nor combining it with existing\\n\\ndeliberate cold exposure protocols,\\n\\nto me, it seems pretty straightforward\\n\\nand a pretty minimal time investment.\\n\\nJust two minutes of deliberate cold exposure\\n\\nby way of water immersion up to the neck\\n\\nand five times a week of 30 seconds each\\n\\nof deliberate cold exposure by way of cold shower.\\n\\nAnd just a quick mention about cold showers.\\n\\nIf you're going to use cold showers\\n\\nto do deliberate cold exposure,\\n\\nyou're going to want to stand under the shower itself,\\n\\nand essentially have it hit your head,\\n\\nthe back of your neck and your upper back,\\n\\nwhich is where most of your brown fat stores\\n\\nare concentrated.\\n\\nIt turns out that cold exposure\\n\\nto those regions of the body in particular\\n\\nare going to trigger the adaptation\\n\\nof increased brown fat stores,\\n\\nwhich involves increases in mitochondria in those fat.\\n\\nAgain, this is not the blubbery fat beneath the skin.\\n\\nThis is the fat that acts as kind of an oil in the furnace\\n\\nthat is your thermogenic properties of your body\\n\\nto generate heat and burn off\\n\\nso-called white adipose tissue elsewhere in the body.\\n\\nNow, anyone that understands the laws of physics\\n\\nand thermodynamics will be saying,\\n\\nwait, in order to get fat loss,\\n\\nyou need to have a caloric deficit.\\n\\nCalories in, calories out still applies.\\n\\nAnd yes, that's absolutely true.\\n\\nWe can only conclude on the basis of the results\\n\\nof this study that the people that lost body fat\\n\\nwere indeed in a caloric deficit,\\n\\npresumably because all other factors\\n\\nwere held more or less constant in this group of soldiers,\\n\\npresumably because the deliberate cold exposure itself\\n\\nelevated metabolism, thereby increasing\\n\\nthe calories out component\\n\\nof the calories in, calories out equation,\\n\\nwhich of course governs the rules of weight loss\\n\\nand body fat loss as well.\\n\\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\\n\\nthat this podcast is separate from my teaching\\n\\nand research roles at Stanford.\\n\\nIt is however, part of my desire and effort\\n\\nto bring zero cost to consumer information about science\\n\\nand science related tools to the general public.\\n\\nIn keeping with that theme,\\n\\nI'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.\\n\\nOur first sponsor is Element.\\n\\nElement is an electrolyte drink with everything you need\\n\\nand nothing you don't.\\n\\nThat means plenty of salt, magnesium and potassium,\\n\\nthe so-called electrolytes and no sugar.\\n\\nNow, salt, magnesium and potassium are critical\\n\\nto the function of all the cells in your body,\\n\\nin particular to the function of your nerve cells,\\n\\nalso called neurons.\\n\\nIn fact, in order for your neurons to function properly,\\n\\nall three electrolytes need to be present\\n\\nin the proper ratios.\\n\\nAnd we now know that even slight reductions\\n\\nin electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body\\n\\ncan lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.\\n\\nElement contains a science backed electrolyte ratio\\n\\nof 1000 milligrams, that's one gram of sodium,\\n\\n200 milligrams of potassium and 60 milligrams of magnesium.\\n\\nI typically drink Element first thing in the morning\\n\\nwhen I wake up in order to hydrate my body\\n\\nand make sure I have enough electrolytes.\\n\\nAnd while I do any kind of physical training\\n\\nand after physical training as well,\\n\\nespecially if I've been sweating a lot.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,\\n\\nthat's lmnt.com slash Huberman\\n\\nto claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.\\n\\nAgain, that's Drink Element, lmnt.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nToday's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.\\n\\nThesis makes custom nootropics.\\n\\nNow, nootropics is a word that I don't like.\\n\\nI don't like it because it means smart drugs.\\n\\nAnd as a neuroscientist,\\n\\nwe know that we have brain circuits for focus,\\n\\nbrain circuits that enable creativity,\\n\\nbrain circuits that allow task switching and on and on.\\n\\nSo there's really no such thing as a brain circuit\\n\\nfor being smart.\\n\\nNow Thesis understands this\\n\\nand has designed custom nootropics\\n\\nthat are designed to get your brain and body\\n\\ninto the optimal state for the specific types of work\\n\\nthat is physical or cognitive work that you want to do.\\n\\nI've been using Thesis for more than a year now\\n\\nand it's completely changed the way that I approach work.\\n\\nI typically take the clarity formula\\n\\nprior to doing any kind of cognitive work\\n\\nand I'll take their energy formula often before workouts.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try\\n\\nyour own personalized nootropic starter kit,\\n\\nyou can go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman\\n\\nand take their brief three-minute quiz.\\n\\nThat quiz will allow them to send you\\n\\nfour different trial formulas that you can use for a month\\n\\nand then you can iterate with them\\n\\nto find the ideal nootropic formulas for you.\\n\\nAgain, that's takethesis.com slash Huberman\\n\\nand use the code Huberman at checkout\\n\\nto get 10% off your first order.\\n\\nToday's episode is also brought to us by HVMN ketone IQ.\\n\\nKetone IQ is a ketone supplement\\n\\nthat increases blood ketones.\\n\\nNow, many people have heard of the ketogenic diet\\n\\nand indeed the ketogenic diet has been useful\\n\\nfor many people out there.\\n\\nHowever, most people out there, including myself,\\n\\ndo not follow a ketogenic diet.\\n\\nThat is, I eat carbohydrates.\\n\\nHowever, it's important to note\\n\\nthat even if you are not on a ketogenic diet,\\n\\nyou can benefit from increasing your blood ketones.\\n\\nIn fact, I'll use ketone IQ after lunch\\n\\nor in the afternoon with some coffee\\n\\nor sometimes first thing in the morning.\\n\\nIf I'm particularly hungry and I want to do exercise\\n\\nor I want to do cognitive work,\\n\\nbut I want to delay my first meal,\\n\\nusing ketone IQ allows me to curb my hunger\\n\\nand gives me a lot of focus and energy.\\n\\nAnd that's because ketones are one of the brain's\\n\\npreferred fuels for cognitive work.\\n\\nIn fact, ketones have been shown to be associated\\n\\nwith forebrain function,\\n\\nwhich is associated with context switching, focus,\\n\\nand formulations of strategies, et cetera,\\n\\nall the sorts of things that are important\\n\\nfor doing deliberate focused work or physical performance.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try ketone IQ,\\n\\nyou can go to hvmn.com slash

discuss\\n\\non the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\n\\nyou can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,\\n\\nlivemomentous.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nAnd I should just mention that the library\\n\\nof those supplements is constantly expanding.\\n\\nAgain, that's livemomentous.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nLet's talk about water.\\n\\nAnd let's start off by answering the question,\\n\\nwhat is water?\\n\\nWater is of course H2O.\\n\\nMost everybody knows that from an early age.\\n\\nBut what H2O means is that each molecule of water\\n\\nconsists of two hydrogens and one oxygen.\\n\\nNow the physical arrangement of those two hydrogens\\n\\nand one oxygen turns out to be really important\\n\\nfor how water functions in the body\\n\\nand frankly elsewhere in our world and life.\\n\\nIf you were to make a peace symbol,\\n\\nthat is to put up your index finger\\n\\nand your middle finger simultaneously.\\n\\nIn fact, I'm going to recommend you do that now,\\n\\nunless you're using your hands for something else important,\\n\\nin which case do it later.\\n\\nWell, if you make that peace symbol\\n\\nand you look at your hand,\\n\\nyou have a pretty good impression\\n\\nof what an individual water molecule consists of,\\n\\nwhich is H2O, two hydrogens and an oxygen.\\n\\nAnd with that peace symbol,\\n\\nthe fingers or the tips of your fingers rather\\n\\nare going to represent the hydrogens.\\n\\nYour fingers, that is the length of each of those fingers\\n\\nis going to represent the electron bonds to the oxygen\\n\\nand the palm of your hand and the fingers that are down\\n\\nare going to represent the oxygen, okay?\\n\\nNow what's important about that visual impression\\n\\nor visual image of the individual water molecule\\n\\nis that it is polarized.\\n\\nThat is the hydrogens over on one side,\\n\\nboth of them are over on one side\\n\\nand the oxygen is over on another.\\n\\nAnd what's really important about water molecules\\n\\nbeing polarized is that they can bind to one another\\n\\nby way of that polarization.\\n\\nAnd this has to do with something that we all kind of learned\\n\\nin chemistry at one point, but many of us forgot.\\n\\nMaybe we didn't even understand it the first time around,\\n\\nwhich is that positives and negatives attract.\\n\\nSo when you have individual water molecules,\\n\\nthey have the opportunity to interact\\n\\nand essentially bind to one another\\n\\nand they bind through what are called covalent bonds.\\n\\nCovalent bonds are relatively weak bonds.\\n\\nAnd so as a consequence, water can change its confirmation.\\n\\nHowever, covalent bonds are strong enough\\n\\nthat water actually can maintain some structure\\n\\nand that structure will vary, of course,\\n\\ndepending on its temperature.\\n\\nSo what you need to know about water is that indeed\\n\\nit consists of lots of individual H2Os\\n\\nand those H2Os can arrange themselves in different ways\\n\\nand that temperature is a strong determinant\\n\\nof the arrangement of those water molecules.\\n\\nThat is they're bonding to one another.\\n\\nAnd in fact, even they're spacing between those bonds.\\n\\nSo again, even if you don't have any chemistry,\\n\\nstay with me because you'll definitely understand this.\\n\\nWater can exist in at least three forms\\n\\nand maybe four forms.\\n\\nWe know that it can be liquid, of course.\\n\\nIt's really normally what we think of\\n\\nwhen we think of water.\\n\\nIt can be gas, so we think of steam, right?\\n\\nSo we heat it up.\\n\\nIt takes on not a semi-solid or a semi-liquid form.\\n\\nIt takes on this property of steam or gas, okay?\\n\\nSo when you see steam or when you breathe on a cold day\\n\\nthrough your mouth or through your nose\\n\\nand you see your air,\\n\\nthose are water molecules that are condensing,\\n\\nthat is bonding in certain ways\\n\\nbased on differences in temperature\\n\\nbetween the inside of your body and the outside air.\\n\\nAnd of course, it can be a solid.\\n\\nIt can be ice.\\n\\nNow, ice is fascinating and important\\n\\nin understanding how water works.\\n\\nAnd this will become relevant later\\n\\nwhen we think about how water works within the body as well,\\n\\nespecially how different temperatures of water\\n\\nimpact the health and behavior of ourselves.\\n\\nAnd the most important point to understand\\n\\nabout water in its solid state\\n\\nis that unlike most substances,\\n\\nwhen water is in its solid state,\\n\\nit is actually less dense\\n\\nthan when it's in its liquid state.\\n\\nSo just think about that.\\n\\nMost substances, most metals, for instance,\\n\\nwhen they are in a solid state,\\n\\nthey are more dense than when they are in a liquid state.\\n\\nSo for instance, if they're in a solid state,\\n\\nthey will sink in a container filled with their liquid form,\\n\\nnot water.\\n\\nWater is very interesting because as you cool water\\n\\nand water transitions from a liquid to a solid,\\n\\nit still binds, that is,\\n\\nit could form bonds\\n\\nbetween those different molecules of water.\\n\\nBut the spacing between those H2Os,\\n\\nso again, those peace symbols with hands,\\n\\nso if you had a bunch of those,\\n\\nif you had 1,000 hands all making peace symbols,\\n\\nthey can bond to one another.\\n\\nBut when it's cold,\\n\\nthose bonds are actually made further apart\\n\\nfrom one another.\\n\\nAnd as a consequence, ice, as we all know,\\n\\nfloats in water.\\n\\nIn other words, put very simply,\\n\\nwater is unusual and special in that in its solid form, ice,\\n\\nit is actually less dense than when it's in its liquid form.\\n\\nAnd that's why ice floats in water.\\n\\nNow, this is important, not just to our biology,\\n\\nbut to all of life.\\n\\nBecause if you think about it,\\n\\nif it were not the case that water is less dense\\n\\nin its solid form, ice, than it is in its liquid form,\\n\\nthe bottoms of our oceans would be covered\\n\\nwith thick sheets of ice.\\n\\nAnd if that were the case,\\n\\nyou can be absolutely sure that life would not exist\\n\\non our planet the way that it does.\\n\\nAnd there's a good chance\\n\\nthat we would not exist as a species\\n\\nbecause so much of what allows us to exist on this planet\\n\\nand the other animals to exist on this planet\\n\\nrelies on photosynthesis pathways in plants\\n\\nthat are dependent on the sun and interactions\\n\\nwith the oceans and lakes and other bodies of water.\\n\\nAnd of course, the ice caps are vitally important.\\n\\nThat is the presence of ice, especially at the poles,\\n\\nbut elsewhere in bodies of water as well.\\n\\nSo what icebergs are a critical part of the ecosystem\\n\\nthat allows for everything from photosynthesis\\n\\nto the ability of certain animals\\n\\nto extract food from each other\\n\\nand from their local resources?\\n\\nNow there's a whole discussion to be had there,\\n\\nbut the important point for now\\n\\nis that the physical properties of the bonds between water\\n\\nthat are made and changed depending on temperature\\n\\nturn out to be essential for us\\n\\nto be present on this planet at all.\\n\\nAnd for ourselves to function in the ways that they do\\n\\nfor sake of health and for sake of disease.\\n\\nAnd we'll explore this later\\n\\nwhen we talk about the critical relationship\\n\\nbetween temperature, pH,\\n\\nwhich is the relationship between alkalinity,\\n\\nhow basic or acidity, how acid a given liquid\\n\\nor in this case, we're going to be talking about water is\\n\\nand the ways that our cells can or can't use water.\\n\\nSo I realized that this is a fairly in-depth\\n\\nfor those of you that don't have much of a background\\n\\nin chemistry, I've tried to keep it really top contour,\\n\\nbut if you can make a peace symbol\\n\\nor if you can just imagine a peace symbol in your mind\\n\\nand realize that that's a water molecule\\n\\nand that those water molecules combined to one another\\n\\nthrough bonds that are relatively strong,\\n\\nbut weak enough that they can be broken if they need to.\\n\\nAnd that the temperature that those water molecules\\n\\nare exposed to changes the distance between those bonds.\\n\\nAnd that's what allows ice to float in water.\\n\\nThen you are going to have no problem\\n\\nwith the remainder of the discussion today.\\n\\nIn fact, you will also have the ability to understand\\n\\nthings that you've observed many times over,\\n\\nbut perhaps have never thought about or really understood,\\n\\nwhich are for instance,\\n\\nthat water has a certain level of surface tension.\\n\\nFor instance, if you've ever been to the ocean\\n\\nand the waves are coming in,\\n\\nwhat you'll notice is if you walk on the dry sand\\n\\nor gravel of pebbles, that is of the ocean,\\n\\nit's very easy, right?\\n\\nI mean, the pebbles move down or the sand moves down,\\n\\nit depresses a little bit due to the weight of your body.\\n\\nBut as you get closer to the water,\\n\\nyou're going to sink deeper\\n\\nbecause that sand is more saturated with water.\\n\\nBut at some point,\\n\\nyou won't be able to actually walk on top of the water,\\n\\nright?\\n\\nIt has been said that Jesus walked on water.\\n\\nThere's the so-called Jesus Christ lizard,\\n\\nso named because it can actually walk\\n\\non the surface of water.\\n\\nA leaf can float on the surface of water.\\n\\nUnder some conditions,\\n\\na coin can float on the surface of water.\\n\\nIf you make coffee in the morning,\\n\\nyou can actually take a spoonful of that hot coffee\\n\\nand pour a little bit on the surface of your coffee.\\n\\nAnd you'll notice that it will bead up\\n\\nand you'll get little round spheres of water.\\n\\nThose are little water molecules bound to one another\\n\\nthat spin on top of the surface before they sink under.\\n\\nThat has everything to do with the bonding between water\\n\\nthat's dependent on temperature,\\n\\nbut also as with the difficulty for essentially everybody\\n\\nto walk on water or for animals to walk on water,\\n\\nthe surface tension of water\\n\\nallows certain things to float there\\n\\nor to stay at the surface.\\n\\nBut there's a very thin layer of water molecules\\n\\nat the surface of water that are more dense\\n\\nthan the water that resides at deeper depths.\\n\\nAnd that's why most things, including us, sink in water.\\n\\nWe are more dense than water.\\n\\nNow, I did mention earlier\\n\\nthat there are three forms of water.\\n\\nThose are the ones that we all are familiar with,\\n\\nthe solid, liquid, and gas forms of water.\\n\\nHowever, there are data mainly from Gerald Pollock's\\n\\nlaboratory at the University of Washington\\n\\nthat have described the so-called fourth phase of water,\\n\\nwhich is structured water.\\n\\nAnd we'll get into this a little bit later\\n\\nbecause structured water has really been a prominent topic\\n\\nin the, let's call it the water health aficionados.\\n\\nIt's a heavily debated topic\\n\\nas to whether or not structured water\\n\\nis somehow better for ourselves\\n\\nif it exists within our bodies.\\n\\nWe'll get into that in full detail later.\\n\\nBut the whole notion of structured water\\n\\nis that in the presence of certain solids\\n\\nor certain liquids, the confirmation of water,\\n\\nthat is the water molecules, actually change somewhat.\\n\\nThis has been demonstrated.\\n\\nWhether or not it has relevance\\n\\nto the biological function of our body is a different issue.\\n\\nBut we know that there is this fourth phase of water\\n\\ncalled structured water.\\n\\nStructured water is a fairly complicated topic,\\n\\nbut we can make it very simple\\n\\nfor sake of today's discussion.\\n\\nI mentioned earlier that opposite poles attract,\\n\\nthat is, positives and negatives attract.\\n\\nAnd typically, things that are negatively charged\\n\\nwhen presented with another negative charge\\n\\neither repel or don't attract.\\n\\nThings that are positively charged\\n\\nin the presence of another positive charge\\n\\nalso tend to repel.\\n\\nThis is the basis of magnets,\\n\\neither sticking to one another\\n\\nor repelling from one another.\\n\\nThere's also the idea that human beings\\n\\nwho are opposites attract,\\n\\nbut that's a different episode\\n\\nthat we need to do in the future.\\n\\nThe point here is that structured water\\n\\nis a unique condition in which the local environment\\n\\nthat these water molecules happen to be in\\n\\nallows positive charges between different water molecules\\n\\nto attract one another.\\n\\nSo again, whereas normally it's positive\\n\\nand negatives that attract,\\n\\nin the configuration that we call structured water,\\n\\npositives and positives attract\\n\\nand form bonds that are stronger than the typical bonds\\n\\nthat would be formed between water molecules.\\n\\nAnd just as it kind of prelude to our discussion\\n\\nabout structured water,\\n\\nas it may or may not relate to health later,\\n\\nthere are a number of people that believe\\n\\nthat within the body,\\n\\nbecause of the presence of certain liquids and solids,\\n\\nthat the water within our cells,\\n\\nand in particular within the interactions\\n\\nwith so-called organelles,\\n\\norganelles are things like mitochondria,\\n\\nthe Golgi apparatus, they have fancy names.\\n\\nThese are the things within cells\\n\\nthat allow cells to do everything from make proteins\\n\\nto traffic proteins out to the surface of cells,\\n\\nthings like neurotransmitters and receptors and so on.\\n\\nA lot of people who are interested in structured water\\n\\nas it relates to biological function\\n\\nhave hypothesized or like to debate rather,\\n\\nwhether or not in the body,\\n\\nwater is not just present in its liquid form\\n\\nor gaseous form.\\n\\nWe know it's not present in its solid form\\n\\nunless you gulp down some ice cubes, for instance.\\n\\nBut there is a cohort of people out there,\\n\\nincluding some fairly accomplished scientists\\n\\nthat believe that within the body,\\n\\nthe organelles of our cells act as a substrate\\n\\nfor water to exist in this fourth form,\\n\\nthis structured water form.\\n\\nAnd that's led to this whole niche industry\\n\\nof people who are proponents\\n\\nof consuming so-called structured water.\\n\\nAgain, we'll get to that a little bit later.\\n\\nSo now you know what individual water molecules consist of.\\n\\nWhen you hear H2O,\\n\\nhopefully you'll get that visual image in your mind\\n\\nof an individual water molecule being the peace symbol\\n\\nand a bunch of those binding to one another\\n\\nthrough these relatively weak bonds,\\n\\nbut strong enough that certain things can take place\\n\\nlike surface tension.\\n\\nKeep in mind that surface tension of water\\n\\nmay relate to either standard bonds between water\\n\\nor this fourth phase.\\n\\nThat's heavily debated still.\\n\\nBut we certainly know that, for instance,\\n\\nif you were to take a piece of wax paper or glass\\n\\nand you were to pour some water on it,\\n\\nyou would notice that the water would bead up\\n\\nor kind of aggregate at particular locations.\\n\\nWhen you see that beading up\\n\\nor the aggregation of water molecules\\n\\non a particular surface, you're seeing two things.\\n\\nThis is actually kind of fun.\\n\\nThe next time you see it, you'll know that the aggregation,\\n\\nthe beading up of water with itself,\\n\\nso individual water molecules or many water molecules\\n\\nkind of aggregating at one location\\n\\nand making a bead of water, that's due to these bonds,\\n\\nthese covalent bonds occurring between water molecules.\\n\\nBut also you'll notice that on a vertical pane of glass,\\n\\nsay in rain or on your windshield,\\n\\nthat the water will look almost like it's sticking\\n\\nto the glass.\\n\\nAnd that's because there are actually bonds\\n\\nbetween the water molecules that have beaded up themselves\\n\\nand the glass.\\n\\nSo water can not just bind to itself,\\n\\nit can also bind to certain surfaces.\\n\\nAnd the fact that perhaps if you drive your car,\\n\\nif you were to tap the window,\\n\\nor if a big enough bead of water formed on a window\\n\\nthat it would start to drip down,\\n\\nand that's because those bonds with the surface are strong,\\n\\nbut they're not so strong that it stick at that location.\\n\\nQuite different than water that is in its solid form,\\n\\nice, that can actually really adhere.\\n\\nIf you've ever had to scrape ice off a windshield,\\n\\nso for those of you who live in cold regions,\\n\\nyou're familiar with this,\\n\\nhave to scrape ice off a windshield,\\n\\nyou realize that the bonds between water in its solid form\\n\\nand different surfaces is quite a bit stronger\\n\\nthan the bonds between different water molecules\\n\\nwith each other,\\n\\nor the bonds between water and different surfaces\\n\\nwhen they're warmer, okay?\\n\\nSo I do realize that for a lot of people listening,\\n\\nthat's going to be a pretty deep dive into the chemistry\\n\\nand physical properties of water.\\n\\nBut all you really need to know\\n\\nis that these water molecules are incredibly versatile\\n\\nand can bind to each other\\n\\nand can bind to different surfaces\\n\\nand can allow things to float or to sink,\\n\\nor even to move across surfaces of water\\n\\nbased on the three, perhaps four different states\\n\\nthat water can be in.\\n\\nAnd that versatility that you observe in the natural world\\n\\non window panes and rain and clouds and hail and ice\\n\\nand snow and scraping ice off your windshield\\n\\nin the cold of winter and perspiration and so on,\\n\\nall of that is fine and good,\\n\\nbut realize that almost all of those same sorts\\n\\nof properties of water become extremely relevant\\n\\nwhen thinking about how your body actually utilizes water.\\n\\nAnd the key thing here is that temperature\\n\\nand the so-called alkalinity or acidity,\\n\\nthat is the pH of water,\\n\\nturn out to be very important determinants\\n\\nof how water is used by the cells of your body.\\n\\nIn fact, as I'll describe in a moment,\\n\\nwe have entire sets of biological mechanisms\\n\\nsolely devoted to trying to get water into our cells\\n\\nin very specific ways, including at specific rates,\\n\\nand to use water in different ways,\\n\\nbecause as you've probably heard before,\\n\\nwe are mostly water.\\n\\nWhat's kind of interesting to me,\\n\\nand what I found researching this episode\\n\\nis that the percentages of our cells and bodies\\n\\nthat are purported to be water is a pretty broad range.\\n\\nSome people say we're 55% water.\\n\\nOther people will say we're 70% water.\\n\\nSome people say we're 95% water.\\n\\nThe exact percentage doesn't matter so much,\\n\\nand really just boils down to whether or not\\n\\nthe person that's stating that percentage\\n\\nis talking about how much water is present\\n\\nin our cells and body at a given moment,\\n\\nversus how much water was involved\\n\\nin the process of creating the sorts of proteins\\n\\nand other things of our body that are required\\n\\nto have hair cells, skin cells, brain cells, et cetera.\\n\\nSo if you really want a number out there,\\n\\nI can't give you a single number.\\n\\nIf you want to be accurate, it's going to have to be a range,\\n\\nand basically we are anywhere from 70% to 90% water,\\n\\ndepending on how you define being water.\\n\\nThat is, whether or not you're talking about\\n\\nwater being present in cells in its liquid form,\\n\\nor maybe in this fourth structure water form\\n\\nif you're of the mind that that exists within us,\\n\\nand whether or not you're talking about water\\n\\nthat was used to create a given protein,\\n\\nlike a receptor or a transmitter,\\n\\nor whether or not you're talking about the water\\n\\njust being water as H2O, okay?\\n\\nSo again, it's very easy to go down that rabbit hole,\\n\\nand this is part of the reason why there's such\\n\\na wide discrepancy of assertions\\n\\nas to how much of us is water, but let's be direct.\\n\\nMost of our body is water,\\n\\nand there isn't a single other molecule in the universe\\n\\nthat we can look to and say that it has as important\\n\\na role in our health and biology,\\n\\nand frankly, our presence of life on earth at all,\\n\\nthan water.\\n\\nI'd like to take a quick break\\n\\nand acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.\\n\\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1,\\n\\nis a

podcast.\\n\\nThe reason I started taking Athletic Greens\\n\\nand the reason I still take Athletic Greens\\n\\nonce or usually twice a day\\n\\nis that it gets to be the probiotics\\n\\nthat I need

year's supply of vitamin D3K2.\\n\\nOkay, so now at a minimum,\\n\\neveryone out there should understand\\n\\nthat water has a particular structure.\\n\\nSo when you hear H2O, you can kind of imagine that structure,\\n\\nand that the water molecules can change their conformation.\\n\\nThat is, they can bind to other water molecules,\\n\\nand it turns out they can bind to other things\\n\\nand actually change the conformation of other things.\\n\\nA good example of that is something\\n\\nwe're all familiar with, which is water's ability\\n\\nto dissolve certain substances like sugar or salt,\\n\\nand that is because salt molecules or sugar molecules\\n\\nare what we call hydrophilic.\\n\\nThey like water, and when we say they like water,\\n\\nit just means that the chemical structure of salt,\\n\\nsodium, or the chemical structure of, say, sucrose,\\n\\nlike table sugar, can actually interact\\n\\nwith the hydrogens and oxygens of water\\n\\nand can change those salt molecules or sugar molecules,\\n\\nturning them from solid into liquid,\\n\\nessentially creating what are called solutes,\\n\\nwhich is basically the dissolving of solids\\n\\ninto liquid solutions.\\n\\nIn fact, water is one of the best solvents on the planet.\\n\\nIn fact, water is better at dissolving many solids\\n\\nthan is acid, right?\\n\\nThat's how incredible water is,\\n\\nand there are a number of reasons\\n\\nrelated to the chemistry of water that can explain that.\\n\\nBut as we transition from talking about the physics\\n\\nand chemistry of water to how water actually behaves\\n\\nwithin our body and contributes to our health\\n\\nor to disease, depending on the case,\\n\\nit's important to understand that molecules,\\n\\nsuch as sugar and salt, can be hydrophilic,\\n\\nor, as we know, oil and water don't mix.\\n\\nThat's because oils, lipids, are so-called hydrophobic.\\n\\nWhat's hydrophobic?\\n\\nYou just think, ah, phobic.\\n\\nCertain molecules, such as lipids,\\n\\ndon't dissolve well in water,\\n\\nand we all intuitively understand that.\\n\\nIf you take some olive oil, for instance,\\n\\nand you put it into a little glass of water,\\n\\nit'll likely float or bead up\\n\\nor form little spherical or amoeba-like shapes\\n\\nwithin the water, and that's because oil,\\n\\nlipids, are hydrophobic.\\n\\nSo different substances out there\\n\\nare either going to be more hydrophilic,\\n\\nthat is, they are going to have a greater propensity\\n\\nto interact with water and bind with the different aspects\\n\\nof the water molecules, or hydrophobic,\\n\\nto have less of a propensity to interact with\\n\\nand bind with water molecules.\\n\\nAnd I've sort of been alluding to this numerous times\\n\\nthroughout this podcast already,\\n\\nthe temperature of water and the pH,\\n\\nthat is, the alkalinity or acidity of water,\\n\\nwill have a strong impact on whether or not\\n\\na hydrophilic or hydrophobic substance\\n\\nwill have a greater or lesser tendency\\n\\nto interact with water.\\n\\nYou all know this intuitively as well.\\n\\nIf you've ever tried to dissolve, say,\\n\\na big tablespoon of sugar in very cold water,\\n\\nyou'll notice that the grains don't dissolve as quickly\\n\\nas when you take that big tablespoon of sugar\\n\\nand put it into a warm or hot cup of water,\\n\\nand that's because the temperature of water\\n\\nactually changes how well that sugar molecule\\n\\nis able to change its conformation\\n\\nand interact with the water molecules.\\n\\nLikewise, if you want to get something\\n\\nthat's really hydrophilic into an aqueous,\\n\\nthat is a water-containing solution,\\n\\nthe temperature is also going to strongly impact that.\\n\\nNow, there are a near infinite number of examples\\n\\nof how temperature and pH impact the tendency\\n\\nof hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances\\n\\nto dissolve in water or not.\\n\\nWe're not going to go into all those details,\\n\\nbut as we migrate from our discussion\\n\\nabout the physics and chemistry of water\\n\\ninto how water behaves within our body,\\n\\nwhich is what we're going to do now,\\n\\nand then as we continue into the third part\\n\\nof our discussion, which is why and how certain types\\n\\nof water that some of you are familiar with,\\n\\nlike different pH water, distilled water,\\n\\nreverse osmosis water, why those different types\\n\\nof water are thought to, and in some cases,\\n\\ndo in fact change the ways that our cells function\\n\\nfor better or for worse.\\n\\nAll of that will come together and make sense for you.\\n\\nOkay, so all the cells of your body, every cell,\\n\\neven your bones, that is the osteoblasts\\n\\nand the other cells within your bones, your bone marrow,\\n\\nyour red blood cells, your white blood cells,\\n\\nyour neurons, your nerve cells, your liver cells,\\n\\nyour kidney cells, all of them require water.\\n\\nIn order to get the proper amount of water into those cells,\\n\\nthere are basically two ways\\n\\nthat water can access those cells.\\n\\nNow, if we zoom out for a second and ask ourselves,\\n\\nhow does water actually get into the body?\\n\\nMost of us just think, oh,\\n\\nwill we drink that water into our body?\\n\\nOf course, that's the main way.\\n\\nWe can also breathe water molecules into our body\\n\\nthrough humid air.\\n\\nWhen you hydrate your cells,\\n\\nthat is when you're bringing water into your cells,\\n\\nthat water needs to move from your gut\\n\\nand into the bloodstream and eventually\\n\\ninto the individual cells, whatever cell type that may be.\\n\\nAnd there are basically two ways\\n\\nthat water can access those cells.\\n\\nThe first way has been known about for a very long time,\\n\\nand that is so-called diffusion.\\n\\nNow, the outside of most cells is made up\\n\\nof fatty stuff, lipid.\\n\\nSo for instance, neurons, nerve cells,\\n\\nhave a lipid bilayer.\\n\\nIt's two layers of fat.\\n\\nAnd you already know that fat, lipid, is very hydrophobic.\\n\\nNow, that turns out to be not a problem,\\n\\nbut a solution for how water can get\\n\\nacross that lipid barrier.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nIt is the fact that water can change its conformation\\n\\nand lipids can change their conformation just enough\\n\\nso that the bonds between water\\n\\nand the bonds between those hydrophobic lipids\\n\\ncan interact, allowing the water molecule\\n\\nto basically pass through the lipid\\n\\nbecause it can bond very weakly,\\n\\nor in some cases not at all, but very weakly to those lipids\\n\\nand then be pushed through to the other side.\\n\\nReally incredible if you think about it.\\n\\nIf there was too much of a hydrophobic relationship\\n\\nbetween the lipid and the water,\\n\\nthe water would come up to the surface\\n\\nof that fatty outside of our cells\\n\\nand then would be repelled away from it.\\n\\nIt would just stay there right at the surface.\\n\\nAnd that would be no good because we actually need\\n\\nthat water to diffuse across the cell membranes,\\n\\nwhere actually it's a double cell membrane,\\n\\nas I mentioned before, two layers.\\n\\nSo water and lipids of cells can interact\\n\\nwith just enough affinity that the water molecule\\n\\ncan diffuse across those cell membrane barriers.\\n\\nBut, and this is an important but,\\n\\nthe diffusion of water molecules across those lipid barriers\\n\\non the outsides of cells is a fairly slow process\\n\\ncompared to the other way that water accesses cells.\\n\\nAnd this other way that water accesses cells\\n\\nis really something that was just discovered\\n\\nabout 10 years ago.\\n\\nSo this is a fairly recent discovery,\\n\\nbut turns out to be a fundamental discovery,\\n\\nwhich is the presence of what are called aquaporin channels.\\n\\nAquaporin channels are basically portals\\n\\nthrough the membrane that allow water molecules\\n\\nto move very quickly across cell membranes\\n\\nat a rate of about 1 million H2Os,\\n\\n1 million water molecules per second.\\n\\nAnd the way that water molecules move across\\n\\nthe cell membrane through those aquaporin channels\\n\\nis very interesting.\\n\\nThe inside of those channels,\\n\\nand the way you think of these is they're literally tubes\\n\\nstuck up through the membranes of cells.\\n\\nThe insides of those channels are very hydrophobic,\\n\\nallowing those water molecules to just jut really quickly,\\n\\nalmost as if in your mind,\\n\\nyou can just imagine as if it was sort of lubricated\\n\\nfor the water, though it's not really lubricated.\\n\\nThe water molecules can move through in single file,\\n\\na million per second.\\n\\nNow, why would you need two ways for water\\n\\nto get across cell membranes?\\n\\nOne, fairly slow through basic diffusion.\\n\\nAnd again, diffusion, folks,\\n\\nis the movement of things from a gradient\\n\\nof higher concentration to lower concentration.\\n\\nWe just think about this as things tend to run downhill\\n\\nfrom higher concentration to lower concentration.\\n\\nThey try and create equilibrium across space.\\n\\nIf you had a bunch of marbles on one side of a box,\\n\\njust imagine that if these were water molecules,\\n\\nbecause of the charges between those hydrogens and oxygens,\\n\\nthere's a tendency for those marbles to spread out\\n\\nand essentially take on a fairly even conformation.\\n\\nThat's basically just diffusion across a space.\\n\\nWater molecules will also move from higher concentration\\n\\nto lower concentration across cell membranes.\\n\\nAnd then you have these portals,\\n\\nthese tubes or these channels as they're called,\\n\\nthese aquaporin channels where water molecules\\n\\ncan move very quickly.\\n\\nNow, the reason why biology seems to have created\\n\\nthese aquaporin channels, and again,\\n\\nI wasn't consulted at the design phase,\\n\\nbut the most logical explanation is that\\n\\nwe have many tissues within our body\\n\\nthat often need water very quickly\\n\\nor need to release water very quickly.\\n\\nLet's think about a couple of these,\\n\\nand then let's look at what the actual distribution\\n\\nof aquaporin channels is throughout the body.\\n\\nWhat is an area of your body\\n\\nthat on occasion will need to move water\\n\\nvery quickly out of it?\\n\\nYou can use your imagination here,\\n\\nbut I'll just tell you that, for instance,\\n\\nyour tear glands or tear ducts\\n\\nneed to release tears very quickly.\\n\\nSo you need to take water that's stored in your body,\\n\\nif there's an emotional experience,\\n\\nor if you look at a very bright light, for instance,\\n\\nor God forbid, if you get some sort of irritant in your eye,\\n\\nyou're going to start to tear up.\\n\\nAnd those tears are the release of fluid\\n\\nfrom those tear ducts.\\n\\nAnd so it's going to be the very rapid release\\n\\nof water from those tear ducts\\n\\nthrough so-called aquaporin channels.\\n\\nAnd in fact, aquaporin channels are heavily expressed.\\n\\nThere are many of them in the cells\\n\\nof the so-called lacrimal glands that release tears.\\n\\nIn addition, we need to absorb water from the gut.\\n\\nAnd the gut has a lining, endothelial lining,\\n\\nand other cell lining, mucosal lining,\\n\\nand water needs often to move very quickly\\n\\nfrom our stomach into the rest of the body.\\n\\nAnd one way that is accomplished\\n\\nis through aquaporin channels\\n\\nthat are expressed all along your gut.\\n\\nSo the discovery of these aquaporin channels\\n\\nis really highly significant\\n\\nin terms of understanding the different ways\\n\\nthat water can interact with\\n\\nand get into the cells of your body.\\n\\nNow, there are aquaporin channels,\\n\\nnot just in the lacrimal glands that allow for tearing\\n\\nor within the gut,\\n\\nbut in many tissues within your body.\\n\\nAnd there you even have different distributions\\n\\nwithin those tissues.\\n\\nIn fact, as one looks at the expression\\n\\nof the different aquaporin channels,\\n\\nbecause it turns out there are different forms of them,\\n\\nacross all the cells and tissues of the body,\\n\\nthere's really no single tissue within the body\\n\\nexcept perhaps the bones of your body,\\n\\nand perhaps the ligaments to some extent\\n\\nthat don't have these aquaporin channels.\\n\\nSome of you out there may have heard\\n\\nof the so-called fascia, fascia and sheath muscles.\\n\\nThey're unique kind of connective tissue\\n\\nthat gives some pliability and yet some rigidity\\n\\nthat allow for a lot of the physical abilities\\n\\nof your musculoskeletal system.\\n\\nIt's incredible tissue.\\n\\nWe'll do an entire episode about fascia at some point.\\n\\nFascinating, fascinating tissue.\\n\\nFascia even contain aquaporin channels.\\n\\nSo the role of aquaporin channels in fascia\\n\\nprobably relates to our specific needs\\n\\nto be able to use specific muscle groups\\n\\nin particular ways at particular times.\\n\\nIn other words, if you're sleeping or lying down or sitting,\\n\\nyou're not using your musculoskeletal system\\n\\nas much as if you're running\\n\\nor performing some repetitive behavior.\\n\\nIt turns out that the aquaporin channels\\n\\nin certain tissues like the fascia can be used\\n\\nwhen we transition from low mobility states\\n\\nto high mobility states, allowing more perfusion\\n\\nor access of water into particular cells of the body\\n\\nwhen we need it.\\n\\nSo just fascinating, fascinating channels,\\n\\nthese aquaporin channels.\\n\\nAnd again, only discovered fairly recently.\\n\\nSo we're still learning new things\\n\\nabout our biology all the time.\\n\\nNow, and a very important feature of the aquaporin channel\\n\\nis that the movement of water molecules\\n\\nacross the cell membrane through those aquaporin channels\\n\\nis strongly dependent on the temperature of water\\n\\nand the pH of water.\\n\\nThis becomes especially important in our description\\n\\nand our deep dive into so-called alkaline water\\n\\nor higher pH water a little bit later.\\n\\nBut I'll just give you a little teaser for now\\n\\nbecause I'm sure that a number of people\\n\\nare wondering about this.\\n\\nIf you go into the store or even a convenience store,\\n\\nyou will see pH water.\\n\\nNow, every water has a pH, right?\\n\\nLower numbers mean more acidic, higher numbers\\n\\nmean more alkaline or more basic.\\n\\nYou'll see pH water that is 7.4, you'll see 7.8,\\n\\nyou'll see 9.8, you'll see a huge range of these things.\\n\\nAnd there are many, many different claims\\n\\nabout how the pH of water is important\\n\\nfor regulating the pH of the body.\\n\\nHere's the real story.\\n\\nThe pH of your body, that is the pH of the cells\\n\\nat different locations in your body\\n\\nis strongly, strongly homeostatically regulated.\\n\\nWhat do I mean by that?\\n\\nIt means it doesn't change that much,\\n\\nwhich means that you have very specific biological mechanisms\\n\\nthat ensure the pH is maintained, for instance,\\n\\nin the skin cells of your skin,\\n\\nin the retinal cells of your eye, in your brain cells.\\n\\nNow, it is true that across the body,\\n\\ndifferent cells and tissues have fairly widely varying pH.\\n\\nNow, it has been said that the pH of bodily tissues\\n\\nis generally between 7.2 and 7.4.\\n\\nHowever, if you were to look at the pH of your gut,\\n\\nand keep in mind that your gut is not just your stomach,\\n\\nyour gut is the entire pathway ranging from your throat\\n\\nall the way down to where you excrete things\\n\\nout of your body.\\n\\nThat entire pathway has different pH levels,\\n\\ndepending on where you are\\n\\nalong the gut and intestinal pathway.\\n\\nAnd in fact, having much lower, that is more acidic pH\\n\\nat certain locations along your gut pathway\\n\\nis what allows those gut microbiota,\\n\\nthose little microorganisms of which you have trillions\\n\\nthat are important for regulating everything\\n\\nfrom neurotransmitter production to hormone production\\n\\nthat allow them to flourish and do well.\\n\\nThat said, except under conditions of hemorrhage\\n\\nor changes in blood volume that are of a dangerous level\\n\\nthat can lead to seizure or even death,\\n\\nthe pH of the rest of the cells of your body\\n\\nand also those gut cells doesn't change that much\\n\\non a moment to moment basis.\\n\\nSo if somebody tells you that you should drink alkaline water\\n\\nor alkalized water, as it's sometimes called,\\n\\nin order to keep your body more alkaline and less acidic,\\n\\nthere is essentially no basis for that\\n\\nat a macroscopic level or even at a local level.\\n\\nNow, what that does not mean is that the pH of the water\\n\\nthat you drink is not important.\\n\\nIn fact, if the pH of the water that you drink is too low,\\n\\nthat is if the water that you consume is too acidic,\\n\\nit will not move as quickly from your gut\\n\\ninto the other regions of your body\\n\\nand therefore the other cells of your body\\n\\nthat require that water will not be able\\n\\nto access it as readily.\\n\\nYou've probably experienced this\\n\\nif you've consumed certain water\\n\\nand it feels like it's sloshing around in your stomach\\n\\nor it feels like it's just somehow staying there\\n\\nor you feel its presence more, not just as volume,\\n\\nbut it's almost as if you can feel the little waves\\n\\nof water along the inside of your gut.\\n\\nNow, sometimes that can relate to temperature,\\n\\nbut oftentimes that can relate to the pH of that water.\\n\\nAnd it turns out it is true that water that is more alkaline,\\n\\nthat is pHs of 7.4 or higher,\\n\\ncan move more readily across the aquaporin channel.\\n\\nAnd in terms of absorption of water\\n\\nfrom the endothelial lining and the other cell type lining\\n\\nof your gut into the rest of your body,\\n\\nit is true that higher pH water,\\n\\nprovided that pH isn't too high,\\n\\nis going to be absorbed more quickly,\\n\\nwhich partially explains why some people have an affinity\\n\\nfor this higher pH water.\\n\\nNow, this is not to say that you need to consume\\n\\nhigh pH water in order to hydrate your body properly.\\n\\nI want to be very clear about that.\\n\\nHowever, if you are interested in what the value\\n\\nof elevated pH water is,\\n\\nit largely has to do with this accelerated absorption.\\n\\nAnd as we'll talk about a little bit later,\\n\\nthere is also growing evidence\\n\\nthat it can adjust the function of certain cells\\n\\nthat are within your immune system\\n\\nand thereby reduce certain inflammatory responses.\\n\\nSo I realize as I'm saying this,\\n\\nsome people out there apply, you think,\\n\\noh no, this guy's like a pH water proponent.\\n\\nHe's saying we have to drink alkaline water\\n\\nor buy very fancy water.\\n\\nNow, I want to be clear, that is not what I'm saying.\\n\\nAnd I'm also not saying that you need\\n\\nto purchase very expensive water\\n\\nin order to derive the maximum benefits\\n\\nfrom the water that you drink.\\n\\nIt turns out there are a few things that you can do\\n\\nby way of temperature and by way of filtering water\\n\\nand a few other tricks that I'll tell you a little bit later\\n\\nthat will allow you to increase the absorption rate\\n\\nof water in the gut, which turns out to be a very\\n\\ninteresting but also potentially important thing to do\\n\\nfor not just reducing inflammation,\\n\\nbut also making sure that you're getting proper hydration\\n\\nof different cell types in your body,\\n\\nincluding rapid hydration of your brain cells,\\n\\nwhich as we'll also talk about in a few moments\\n\\ncan greatly enhance cognitive function.\\n\\nOkay, so we've talked about how water can get into cells.\\n\\nThere are two ways, diffusion and movement\\n\\nthrough these aquaporin channels.\\n\\nWe've earmarked the discussion that the temperature\\n\\nand the pH of water, that is the confirmation of water.\\n\\nAnd here, I really want to embed this in people's minds\\n\\nthat when we talk about temperature of water\\n\\nand pH of water, we're really talking about the arrangement\\n\\nof those H2Os, those water molecules.\\n\\nSo keep that in mind.\\n\\nWe've covered how water can get into cells\\n\\nthrough those two different ways,\\n\\ndiffusion and through the aquaporin channels.\\n\\nWhat we haven't talked about is what happens to water\\n\\nonce it's in cells.\\n\\nAnd this is very simple to explain.\\n\\nOnce water is inside of cells, it's going to be incorporated\\n\\ninto the different proteins and organelles.\\n\\nAgain, organelles are things like mitochondria,\\n\\nthe nucleus of the cells, which contains the DNA\\n\\nand so forth in different ways,\\n\\ndepending on which proteins are there\\n\\nand how hydrophilic or hydrophobic those proteins are,\\n\\nor in some case, aren't.\\n\\nThat's an entire landscape of protein\\n\\nto water-specific interactions,\\n\\nnone of which we need to go into in any specific detail now.\\n\\nBut the one thing that we do need to realize\\n\\nand keep in mind as we go forward\\n\\nis that many of the biological processes in our body\\n\\nthat involve the movement of molecules such as water\\n\\nand interactions with proteins\\n\\nare going to involve the bonding or lack of bonding\\n\\nbetween water molecules and proteins.\\n\\nAnd anytime we're talking about bonding\\n\\nof one thing to the next at the level of chemistry\\n\\nor biology for that matter,\\n\\nbecause they're really the same thing,\\n\\nwe're talking about whether or not\\n\\nthere are electrons present or whether or not\\n\\nthere are charges that are opposite or the same\\n\\nand on and on.\\n\\nIf you've ever heard of so-called reactive oxygen species,\\n\\nwhat are ROSs or reactive oxygen species,\\n\\nor so-called free radicals or antioxidants?\\n\\nAll of that is really just describing the presence\\n\\nor absence of charges that are bound or unbound.\\n\\nSo for instance, if you hear about free radicals,\\n\\nsounds pretty wild, right?\\n\\nFree radicals, what are free radicals?\\n\\nFree radicals can damage cells.\\n\\nThey don't always damage cells,\\n\\nbut they can damage cells\\n\\nbecause they are essentially free electrons.\\n\\nThey are a charge that's sitting out there,\\n\\nnot bound to anything,\\n\\nand therefore can interact with the molecular structure\\n\\nof certain proteins and change those structures\\n\\nby binding to them or interfering\\n\\nwith the normal binding processes of those proteins\\n\\nto water or to other things.\\n\\nAnd in that way, cause damage to those proteins\\n\\nand potentially damage to cells.\\n\\nNow, fortunately, our cells have ways\\n\\nto deal with those free radicals,\\n\\nand those are called antioxidants.\\n\\nAntioxidants are molecules\\n\\nthat can arrive in different forms.\\n\\nSometimes we think of antioxidants as vitamins,\\n\\nbut they are also present in other things as well\\n\\nthat essentially bind up those free radicals\\n\\nor repair the bonds between cells\\n\\nso that the proteins are no longer undergoing these,\\n\\nlet's just call them bad confirmations\\n\\nthat damage the functioning of our cells.\\n\\nSo there are many different theories of aging.\\n\\nThere are many different theories of disease,\\n\\nbut there is not a single disease,\\n\\neither of brain or body,\\n\\nthat doesn't in some way involve the generation\\n\\nof what are called reactive oxygen species,\\n\\nthese free radicals and the damaging of cells\\n\\nat the level of their individual organelles and so forth,\\n\\nnor is there a single disease of brain or body\\n\\nthat has not been shown to benefit\\n\\nfrom having some antioxidant interference\\n\\nget in the way of that oxidative process.\\n\\nSo I realized today is pretty thick with nomenclature.\\n\\nFor those of you that haven't already realized it,\\n\\nwhat you're learning here is organic chemistry.\\n\\nSo you can feel pretty good about the fact\\n\\nthat if you can understand the water molecule\\n\\nand understand a little bit about what free electron is,\\n\\nwhich is basically a charge that's out there\\n\\nthat can potentially do damage\\n\\nand the interactions of things like reactive oxygen species\\n\\nand the ability of stable bonds to buffer against\\n\\nor repair certain damage to cells,\\n\\nas we're describing it here,\\n\\nwell, then what you're essentially thinking about\\n\\nand what we're talking about is organic chemistry.\\n\\nNow, since this is a discussion about chemistry\\n\\nas a service to try and understand\\n\\nthe biological effects of water,\\n\\nkeep in mind that water itself, believe it or not,\\n\\ncan act as an antioxidant,\\n\\nprovided that it's bonding to things in the proper way,\\n\\nwhich requires that it get into cells\\n\\nin the proper amounts and rates,\\n\\nwhich requires that the temperature and pH of that water\\n\\nbe correct and provided that there's enough water there\\n\\nand that that water isn't bound to other things.\\n\\nIt's not containing solids that are damaging\\n\\nand potentially that it's carrying some of the good things\\n\\nsuch as sodium or that there's potassium present.\\n\\nAgain, the so-called electrolytes\\n\\nthat allow cells to function well, okay?\\n\\nSo that's a bit of a trench of information\\n\\nand I don't want people to get overwhelmed or confused.\\n\\nWhat I'm trying to do here\\n\\nis paint a picture of the biology of water,\\n\\nunderstanding that when you ingest water, drinking it down\\n\\nor when you breathe water vapors in the steam room\\n\\nor on a humid day, that water is entering your system.\\n\\nIt's accessing your cells through these two mechanisms,\\n\\ndiffusion across cell membranes,\\n\\nmovement through aquaporin channels\\n\\nand then once inside those cells,\\n\\nit's able to interact with\\n\\nand change the confirmation of different proteins\\n\\nand accelerate or slow down different cellular reactions,\\n\\neverything from normal metabolism to blood pressure\\n\\nto damage cells,\\n\\ndepending on a number of different features of that water\\n\\nas well as what the cells happen to be doing\\n\\nat any given moment.\\n\\nSo with that in mind, I'd like to turn our attention\\n\\nto how water, depending on its temperature, its pH,\\n\\nhow much we drink or how little we drink,\\n\\nwhen we drink that water, et cetera,\\n\\nhow that can impact the health, disease and repair\\n\\nof different cells, tissues and organs of our body.\\n\\nI'd like to just take a brief

of us should drink each day,\\n\\nand how much fluid to drink,\\n\\ndepending on our specific activities and environment.\\n\\nNow, this is perhaps the most commonly asked question\\n\\nwhen the topic of water comes up.\\n\\nHow much water do I need to drink?\\n\\nThe other thing that comes up is a question,\\n\\nwhich is, can't we just follow our natural thirst?\\n\\nThat is, can't we just pay attention to when we're thirsty\\n\\nand then drink fluids?\\n\\nAnd then that leads to the other question,\\n\\nwhich is, does the color of our urine\\n\\nprovide any indication as to whether or not\\n\\nwe are under-hydrated, over-hydrated,\\n\\nor hydrating correctly?\\n\\nSo let me answer each of these things one at a time.\\n\\nAnd in the backdrop, I want to highlight the fact\\n\\nthat there are many, many, if not dozens,\\n\\nhundreds of studies pointing to the fact\\n\\nthat when we are dehydrated,\\n\\nour brain doesn't function as well\\n\\nand our body doesn't function as well.\\n\\nSo what I'm attempting to do in that statement\\n\\nis throw a net around the enormous number of studies\\n\\nthat have shown that even a slight state of dehydration,\\n\\neven 2% dehydration, can lead to a significant\\n\\nand meaningful impact that is a negative impact\\n\\non our ability to, for instance,\\n\\ncarry out endurance-type behaviors.\\n\\nSo our ability to run on a treadmill\\n\\nand stop at the point where we feel like we can't continue\\n\\nis going to be negatively impacted.\\n\\nThat is, we will be able to perform less work\\n\\nfor less period of time\\n\\nwhen we are even slightly dehydrated.\\n\\nLikewise, our strength is reduced\\n\\nby even slight dehydration.\\n\\nLikewise, our cognitive performance,\\n\\nincluding memory, focus, creative thinking,\\n\\nflexible thinking of different kinds,\\n\\nare all significantly impaired\\n\\nwhen we are in states of dehydration.\\n\\nNow that raises an additional question\\n\\nthat deserves attention,\\n\\nwhich is how do we actually measure dehydration?\\n\\nNow you hear different things,\\n\\nlike if you pinch the skin on the top of your hand\\n\\nand it takes more than three seconds\\n\\nto lay down again flat, then you're dehydrated.\\n\\nYou hear that.\\n\\nYou hear, okay, if you are to press on your fingernail\\n\\nand see a change in the color of the tissue\\n\\njust below your fingernail, which indeed does happen,\\n\\nand it does not go back to its original color\\n\\nwithin one to three seconds, then you're dehydrated.\\n\\nYou hear things like this.\\n\\nIf your ankles are swollen when you're wearing socks,\\n\\nyou take off the socks\\n\\nand you can see the imprint of the socks on your lower limbs,\\n\\nthat means you're dehydrated.\\n\\nYou hear this kind of stuff,\\n\\nand you should probably be wondering, is any of that true?\\n\\nTo some extent, it is true,\\n\\nalthough it can vary quite a bit by how old you are,\\n\\nwhether or not the skin on the top of your hand\\n\\ntends to be looser or not,\\n\\ndepending on whether or not you're leaner or not.\\n\\nSo in other words,\\n\\nthose are not absolutely objective measures of dehydration.\\n\\nNow it is true that if normally you can pinch the skin\\n\\non the top of your hand\\n\\nand it returns to its normal flattened position\\n\\nwithin about one to two or three seconds,\\n\\nand it does not do that within five or more seconds,\\n\\nthere's a decent probability\\n\\nthat you're a little bit dehydrated,\\n\\nthat you need to ingest some fluid,\\n\\nor that if you press down on your nail\\n\\nand you see the depression causes a transition\\n\\nfrom kind of a pink color to a white color,\\n\\nand then you release,\\n\\nand it doesn't go back to its original pinkish color\\n\\nwithin a few seconds, well,\\n\\nthen there's a chance that you're dehydrated.\\n\\nBut again, these are not perfect measures of dehydration.\\n\\nYou may be surprised to learn,\\n\\nand I was surprised to learn,\\n\\nthat most of the basis for these statements\\n\\nlike even a 2% dehydration state\\n\\ncan lead to significant reductions\\n\\nin cognitive or physical performance\\n\\nare based on not direct measures of hydration,\\n\\nbut rather on measures of reductions in water intake,\\n\\nwhich is a different thing, right?\\n\\nIt's saying that ordinarily a person\\n\\nof a given body weight needs X amount of fluid per day,\\n\\nand when they get even just 2% less\\n\\nthan that amount of fluid,\\n\\nthen their cognitive and or physical performance is impaired\\n\\nrather than focusing on dehydration of tissues, right?\\n\\nNow, that might seem like a subtle distinction,\\n\\nbut it's actually a meaningful distinction\\n\\nwhen you think about it.\\n\\nHowever, it's a meaningful distinction\\n\\nthat we can leverage toward understanding\\n\\nhow much water or fluid we need to drink each day.\\n\\nNow, there we can really point to some solid numbers\\n\\nthat, believe it or not,\\n\\nare fairly independent of body weight.\\n\\nNow, I say independent of body weight.\\n\\nI'm referring to the amount of fluid\\n\\nthat most healthy adults need at rest.\\n\\nWhat do I mean by at rest?\\n\\nI mean when not exercising\\n\\nand when not in extremely hot environments.\\n\\nSo I'm leaving aside you desert ultramarathoners\\n\\nor people that are doing any kind of movement\\n\\nor living in environments that are very, very hot.\\n\\nHere, I'm mainly referring to people\\n\\nthat live most of their daily life in indoor environments.\\n\\nCould be air conditioned or not air conditioned,\\n\\nheated or not heated.\\n\\nWhat we're trying to arrive at here are some numbers\\n\\nthat can work across the board\\n\\nbecause, of course, there are an infinite number\\n\\nof different conditions\\n\\nthat each and all of you are existing in.\\n\\nSo I'm not going to attempt to give you a body weight\\n\\nby activity, by environment,\\n\\nby humidity formula calculation.\\n\\nIn fact, no such calculation exists.\\n\\nHowever, there are formulas\\n\\nthat can put you into very stable frameworks.\\n\\nThat is levels of water intake for periods of rest\\n\\nwhen you're not exercising\\n\\nand for when you are exercising\\n\\nthat will ensure that you are hydrating\\n\\nwith the one exception being if you are exercising\\n\\nor if you are living in very, very hot conditions\\n\\nand you're not heat adapted to those conditions.\\n\\nSo what are those numbers?\\n\\nIn other words, what is the answer to the question\\n\\nof how much fluid do we need each day?\\n\\nAnd here I'm referring to fluid.\\n\\nI'm not distinguishing between water, caffeinated beverages,\\n\\nsoda, tea, and so on.\\n\\nI'll discuss that in a moment.\\n\\nWe can reasonably say that for every hour\\n\\nthat you are awake in the first 10 hours of your day,\\n\\nthis is important, in the first 10 hours of your day,\\n\\nyou should consume on average eight ounces of fluid.\\n\\nNow, for those of you that are using the metric system,\\n\\nnot ounces, eight ounces of fluid\\n\\nis approximately 236 milliliters of water.\\n\\nAnd for those of you that exist in the metric system\\n\\nand aren't used to thinking about ounces and vice versa,\\n\\njust think about a typical can of soda in the United States\\n\\nis 12 ounces.\\n\\nIn Europe, sometimes the cans of soda\\n\\nare a little bit smaller.\\n\\nThat's a whole discussion unto itself,\\n\\nbut eight ounces of fluid, that is 236,\\n\\nlet's just say 240 milliliters\\n\\nbecause we don't need to be too precise here,\\n\\nof fluid on average every hour\\n\\nfor the first 10 hours of your day,\\n\\nwhich translates to an average of 80 ounces of fluid\\n\\nfor the first 10 hours of your day,\\n\\nor 2,360 milliliters of water, in other words,\\n\\napproximately two liters of water plus a little bit more\\n\\nfor the first 10 hours of your day.\\n\\nNow, I want to be very clear that this does not mean\\n\\nthat you need to ingest eight ounces\\n\\nor 236 milliliters of fluid on the hour every hour\\n\\nfor the first 10 hours of your day.\\n\\nI'm certainly not saying that.\\n\\nAnd in fact, most people are going to find\\n\\nthat they're going to ingest water in boluses,\\n\\nthat is they're going to have perhaps 16 ounces of water,\\n\\n500 milliliters of water at one portion of the day,\\n\\nand then maybe a couple hours of later\\n\\nthat they'll drink some more water or some more coffee\\n\\nor soda or some other beverage\\n\\nin another portion of the day.\\n\\nI do think, however, it's important for most of us\\n\\nto take a step back and ask ourselves\\n\\nwhether or not independent of any other activity\\n\\nor environmental conditions,\\n\\nwhether or not we are in fact ingesting 80 ounces\\n\\nor basically 2.4 liters of water for that 10 hours\\n\\nof the day that spans from the time we wake up\\n\\nuntil 10 hours later.\\n\\nNow, why am I setting this 10 hour framework?\\n\\nThe reason I'm setting this 10 hour framework\\n\\nis that it turns out that your fluid requirements,\\n\\neven just at rest, are vastly different in the time\\n\\nfrom when you wake up until about 10 hours later\\n\\nas compared to the later evening and nighttime.\\n\\nAnd here I'm referring to people\\n\\nthat are not doing night shifts.\\n\\nBut if you are requesting a number\\n\\nof how much fluid to drink,\\n\\nindependent of our needs for fluid for exercise,\\n\\nthat's going to be eight ounces of fluid\\n\\nor 240 milliliters of fluid on average for every hour\\n\\nfrom the time when we wake up until 10 hours later.\\n\\nThat's the simple formulation that should basically ensure\\n\\nthat you're getting sufficient baseline hydration\\n\\nfor the cells and tissues of your body.\\n\\nNow, if you are engaging in exercise,\\n\\nwhether or not it's endurance exercise\\n\\nor whether or not it's resistance training exercise,\\n\\nyou are going to need additional fluids\\n\\nin order to maximize the effects of that exercise\\n\\nand to avoid dehydration.\\n\\nAnd there too, we have some excellent numbers\\n\\nthat we can look to.\\n\\nExcellent because they arrive from research.\\n\\nAnd this is largely peeled from the episode that I did\\n\\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin,\\n\\nProfessor of Kinesiology at Cal State Fullerton.\\n\\nWe did a six episode series all about exercise,\\n\\neverything from strength training, hypertrophy, endurance,\\n\\nnutrition, supplementation, recovery,\\n\\neverything related to exercise.\\n\\nYou can find all of that at hubermanlab.com.\\n\\nAnd one of the components of those episodes\\n\\nthat was discussed,\\n\\nbut that some of you may have not heard,\\n\\nis that there is a simple formula\\n\\nfor how much fluid to ingest on average.\\n\\nKeep in mind this is on average when you're exercising.\\n\\nAnd I refer to this as the so-called Galpin equation.\\n\\nThe Galpin equation states that you should take\\n\\nyour body weight in pounds, divide that by 30,\\n\\nand that will give you the number of ounces of fluid\\n\\nto ingest every 15 to 20 minutes on average while exercising.\\n\\nYour body weight in pounds divided by 30\\n\\nequals the number of ounces of fluid to consume on average\\n\\nevery 15 to 20 minutes.\\n\\nWhen I say on average, what I mean is,\\n\\nit is not the case that you need to stop every 15\\n\\nor 20 minutes and consume that volume of fluid.\\n\\nYou could sip it from moment to moment.\\n\\nYou could wait half an hour or an hour\\n\\nand then consume a larger bolus of fluid, a larger amount.\\n\\nAlthough it is recommended for performance sake\\n\\nthat you sip or consume beverages\\n\\nfairly consistently throughout your training.\\n\\nOne's ability to do that is going to depend\\n\\non a number of things like gastric emptying time,\\n\\nwhether or not the particular exercise you're doing,\\n\\nwhether or not it's running or jumping,\\n\\nis compatible with ingesting fluid on a regular basis\\n\\nor whether or not you need to do it at different intervals\\n\\nthan every 15, 20 minutes, maybe it's every five minutes,\\n\\nmaybe it's every half hour, you have to adjust for you.\\n\\nBut if you were to take the hour of exercise\\n\\nor the half hour of exercise or the three hours of exercise\\n\\nand ask how much fluid to ingest,\\n\\nit's going to be that Galpin equation\\n\\nof body weight in pounds divided by 30\\n\\nequals the number of ounces for every 15 or 20 minutes.\\n\\nAnd of course I can already hear screaming from the back,\\n\\nwhat about for those of us who follow the metric system?\\n\\nAnd there, there's a simple translation\\n\\nof the Galpin equation, which is that you need\\n\\napproximately two milliliters of water\\n\\nper kilogram of body weight every 15 to 20 minutes.\\n\\nAgain, the Galpin equation converted into the metric system\\n\\nis going to be two milliliters of water\\n\\nper kilogram of body weight every 15 to 20 minutes\\n\\non average.\\n\\nI'm sure a number of you are asking\\n\\nwhether or not hydration prior to exercise\\n\\nis also important, it absolutely is.\\n\\nAnd if you follow the numbers that I talked about before,\\n\\napproximately eight ounces or 240 milliliters\\n\\nof fluid intake per hour in the first 10 hours of waking,\\n\\nthat should establish a good baseline\\n\\nof hydration heading into exercise,\\n\\nwhich then prompts the next question I often get,\\n\\nwhich is, is the amount of water that needs to be consumed\\n\\naccording to the Galpin equation during exercise\\n\\non top of or separate from, that is,\\n\\ndoes it replace the amount of fluid that one needs\\n\\nat a basic level, that eight ounces or 240 milliliters?\\n\\nAnd there, the answer sort of goes both ways.\\n\\nI think if you're going to exercise,\\n\\nthen obviously follow the Galpin equation in some way.\\n\\nAgain, you don't need to be ultra specific about this.\\n\\nThese are ballpark figures that will ensure hydration.\\n\\nSo we've set them a little bit higher perhaps than needed\\n\\nto ensure more hydration rather than less.\\n\\nBut basically the short answer is,\\n\\nif you're exercising for about an hour,\\n\\nmost people are exercising for an hour or two,\\n\\nprobably not more than that.\\n\\nMost of my workouts are certainly\\n\\nthe resistance training workouts last about an hour.\\n\\nWell, then you can replace the eight ounces\\n\\nor the 240 milliliters of water that's required at baseline\\n\\nwith what you consume according to the Galpin equation\\n\\nduring that bout of exercise.\\n\\nA common question is if you are exercising\\n\\nin a heated environment, indoor or outdoor,\\n\\nor you are somebody who tends to sweat a lot.\\n\\nAnd by the way, we can all get better at sweating\\n\\nby sweating more.\\n\\nSweat is an adaptation.\\n\\nSo if you sit in the sauna more,\\n\\nyou're going to get better at sweating.\\n\\nIf you exercise more, especially if you wear more layers\\n\\nor if you do it in hotter temperatures\\n\\nor more humid temperatures,\\n\\nyou're going to get better at sweating over time.\\n\\nAnd sweating is an adaptation that helps cool your body.\\n\\nIf you are sweating a lot or you're in heat,\\n\\nhow much fluid should you ingest?\\n\\nIn general, I think it's safe to say\\n\\nthat you may want to increase the values\\n\\non the Galpin equation by about 50 to 100%.\\n\\nSo either increase by 50% or double those numbers\\n\\nif you're in a very hot environment\\n\\nor sweating an awful lot.\\n\\nIf you are sitting in the sauna,\\n\\nI highly recommend consuming at least eight ounces\\n\\nand probably more like 16 ounces of fluid.\\n\\nSo that translates again to about 240 or about 480.\\n\\nLet's just round up 500 milliliters of fluid\\n\\nfor every 20 to 30 minutes that you are in a hot sauna.\\n\\nAnd then of course people ask, well, how hot?\\n\\nAnd it, okay, that starts getting really detailed\\n\\nand we can't distinguish between dry saunas and wet saunas.\\n\\nAnd again, too many variables,\\n\\nbut I would double your fluid intake\\n\\nfor that hot environment exercise\\n\\nor for that hot environment sauna sit.\\n\\nAlso, if you are feeling dehydrated, okay,\\n\\nwhat does feeling dehydrated mean?\\n\\nThat actually has a definition\\n\\nthat we can get into a little bit later,\\n\\nbut what we're really talking about here\\n\\nis if you are feeling as if your throat is dry,\\n\\nyou are quote unquote parched or you're very thirsty.\\n\\nWell, then there's absolutely no problem\\n\\nwith ingesting more fluids, 16 ounces of fluid\\n\\nor 500 milliliters of fluid per hour\\n\\nwhile you're feeling parched.\\n\\nMy read of the literature is that thirst\\n\\nis a reasonable guide for when we tend to be dehydrated.\\n\\nHowever, it is the case\\n\\nthat our thirst doesn't really keep up\\n\\nwith our body's level of dehydration.\\n\\nAnd we know that based on some really nice studies\\n\\nthat have explored the amount of fluid intake\\n\\ncompared to the amount of urination,\\n\\ncompared to the amount of physical output,\\n\\ncompared to the environment that one happens to be in.\\n\\nThese are sort of older studies in the realm of physiology,\\n\\nbut here's the basic rule of thumb\\n\\nthat's gonna work for most people.\\n\\nIf you are feeling parched, consume fluids.\\n\\nIdeally, you consume fluids that don't contain caffeine\\n\\nor other diuretics, diuretics being substances\\n\\nthat cause the release, the urination of fluid\\n\\nfrom the body and or if you are consuming caffeine\\n\\neither prior to or after bouts of exercise\\n\\nor even just at work or you work in a air conditioned\\n\\nor otherwise dry, cool or hot environment\\n\\nthat you try and include some sodium\\n\\nand ideally sodium, potassium, magnesium,\\n\\nthe electrolytes in that beverage.\\n\\nIt could be a little pinch of sea salt with some lemon\\n\\nto adjust the taste a little bit.\\n\\nIt could be an electrolyte drink of element\\n\\nor some other sort.\\n\\nThere are a lot of different types out there.\\n\\nFor most people drinking pure water\\n\\nand I realized that many people do just like\\n\\nthe taste of pure water.\\n\\nChances are you're going to have enough electrolytes\\n\\nunless you're sweating quite a bit\\n\\nor you're exercising quite a lot\\n\\nand under conditions where you are consuming\\n\\nvery few carbohydrates, you're going to excrete more fluid.\\n\\nIf you are ingesting caffeine,\\n\\nwhether or not it's from tea or coffee,\\n\\nI highly recommend increasing your non caffeine fluid intake\\n\\nabout two to one for every volume of caffeine.\\n\\nSo in other words, if you have a six ounces\\n\\nor eight ounces of coffee,\\n\\nyou're going to want 12 to 16 ounces of fluid,\\n\\nideally fluid with electrolytes or a little pinch of salt\\n\\nin order to offset that dehydration.\\n\\nHopefully those will provide good rules of thumb\\n\\nfor what people want to do\\n\\nwhen they're just moving about their day.\\n\\nAgain, underscored by the fact that even slight levels\\n\\nof dehydration can really impair our cognitive\\n\\nand physical performance largely by creating fatigue,\\n\\nbut more often than not by creating brain fog.\\n\\nYou know, I get so many questions about brain fog.\\n\\nWhy do I have brain fog?\\n\\nWhy do I have brain fog?\\n\\nThere is a vast literature showing that quality hydration,\\n\\nmeaning hydration that matches the demands of humidity\\n\\nand output as described in the equations\\n\\nthat we went over a little bit before,\\n\\nreally can enhance clarity of focus and overall energy.\\n\\nAnd we'll talk about why that is,\\n\\nbut I'll just allude to it a little bit here.\\n\\nThe reason why ingesting sufficient fluids\\n\\ncan enhance our ability to focus\\n\\nand in fact can reduce brain fog\\n\\nand can increase physical vigor and output\\n\\nis not mysterious to us.\\n\\nWe know that there are two mechanisms\\n\\nby which fluid intake triggers elevated levels of alertness.\\n\\nAnd it all has to do with the so-called sympathetic arm\\n\\nof the autonomic nervous system, which is a real mouthful,\\n\\nbut basically the sympathetic arm\\n\\nof the autonomic nervous system,\\n\\nas many of you heard me talk about before,\\n\\nis the aspect of your nervous system\\n\\nthat makes you more alert.\\n\\nIt has nothing to do with emotional sympathy.\\n\\nIt has to do with a bunch of neurons\\n\\nin the middle of your spinal cord\\n\\ncalled the sympathetic chain ganglia\\n\\nand some other related neural networks in your body,\\n\\nas well as regions of your brain,\\n\\nlike the locus coeruleus that release things\\n\\nlike epinephrine and norepinephrine\\n\\nand make you more alert.\\n\\nAnd in a kind of magnificent arrangement,\\n\\nor I think magnificent arrangement,\\n\\nwhen we have fluid in our gut\\n\\nand when our cells are well hydrated,\\n\\nand believe it or not,\\n\\nwhen our bladder contains fluid within it,\\n\\nthere is an elevation in activity\\n\\nof the sympathetic nervous system by way of two pathways.\\n\\nOne is mechanical.\\n\\nIn fact, we have so-called stretch receptors\\n\\nin our bladder and in our gut.\\n\\nThese stretch receptors have fancy names\\n\\nlike TRP, trip channels, as they're called,\\n\\nor piezo, which are these stretch sensing channels.\\n\\nThis is the beautiful work of many laboratories,\\n\\nbut in particular, David Julius and Ardem Pedapuchin.\\n\\nDavid Julius is at UC San Francisco.\\n\\nArdem is at the Scripps Institute.\\n\\nThey've discovered a bunch of channels and cells\\n\\nthat sense things from cold to different mechanical pressure,\\n\\nincluding expansion of tissues, so-called mechanosensation.\\n\\nAnd basically what it all boils down to\\n\\nis that when our bladder has some fluid in it,\\n\\nwhen our stomach has some fluid in it,\\n\\nand when our cells are sufficiently hydrated,\\n\\nthey send information about the mechanical presence\\n\\nof that distension.\\n\\nAnd here I'm not talking about being overly full\\n\\nor full chock-a-block full of fluid\\n\\nor your bladder feeling really, really full.\\n\\nWe'll talk about that in a moment.\\n\\nBut when we are sufficiently hydrated,\\n\\nthere's a mechanical signature of that,\\n\\nwhich is the expansion of our tissues\\n\\nbecause it has more fluid in it.\\n\\nAnd there are chemical signals as well,\\n\\nwhich is the movement of water\\n\\nacross those aquaporin channels is actually understood\\n\\nat a biological level by our cells.\\n\\nAnd sends information to the areas of the brain\\n\\nthat are associated with so-called sympathetic arousal\\n\\nand makes us more alert.\\n\\nThis is actually what wakes us up in the middle of the night.\\n\\nIf we have consumed too much fluid prior to sleep\\n\\nand we need to urinate, we wake up.\\n\\nThis is a mechanism that is not adequately developed\\n\\nin babies and young children.\\n\\nThis is why babies, young children often will wet their bed.\\n\\nAnd believe it or not, in both humans and in dogs,\\n\\nour ability to control urination voluntarily\\n\\nis something that we actually learn.\\n\\nBabies just pee in their diaper.\\n\\nDogs just pee on the floor until they're housebroken\\n\\nor until a child learns to hold onto their urine\\n\\nuntil they go to the bathroom in the bathroom\\n\\nor particularly appropriate location,\\n\\noutdoors or otherwise.\\n\\nThe point is that hydration of the body\\n\\nis signaled to the brain.\\n\\nWhen we have enough fluid in the tissues of our body,\\n\\nwhen we've consumed enough fluid,\\n\\neven if it hasn't already arrived to the cells\\n\\nand tissues of our body,\\n\\nthat is signaled to the brain in the form of alertness.\\n\\nAnd that alertness is what translates\\n\\nto the enhanced cognitive abilities that we have\\n\\nwhen we are well hydrated.\\n\\nIt's also what translates to our enhanced physical abilities\\n\\nwhen we are challenged with physical tasks.\\n\\nSo when you look out on the landscape\\n\\nof all these studies that have shown impairments\\n\\nin physical or cognitive performance\\n\\nunder conditions of even slight dehydration,\\n\\nthat all makes sense because our cells need fluid\\n\\nand we need water, but it also prompts the question of,\\n\\nwell, does being well hydrated\\n\\nactually make our brain and body function better\\n\\nin the context of physical and cognitive performance?\\n\\nAnd indeed the answer is yes.\\n\\nNow, earlier we were talking about these equations\\n\\nthat you can apply.\\n\\nAnd here again, I really want to emphasize\\n\\nthat these equations were not meant to be followed\\n\\ndown to the decimal point.\\n\\nThey were really meant and are meant as crude\\n\\nbut sufficient guides for you to make sure\\n\\nthat you're getting enough hydration,\\n\\ndepending on your levels of activity and at rest.\\n\\nIf you recall, when we talked about those equations,\\n\\nI said, you need about eight ounces\\n\\nor 240 milliliters of fluid per hour\\n\\nfor the first 10 hours of your day after waking.\\n\\nNow, why did I say for the first 10 hours?\\n\\nWell, it turns out that the filtration of fluids\\n\\nfrom your body, which is accomplished of course\\n\\nby your kidneys and by way of your bladder\\n\\nand the excretion of fluid out your urethra,\\n\\nso-called urination,\\n\\nis strongly, strongly circadian dependent,\\n\\nmeaning the cells of your kidney\\n\\nand the cells even of your gut,\\n\\nin fact, all the cells of your body,\\n\\nbut especially the cells of your kidney\\n\\nwhich filter the fluid that comes into your body\\n\\nand that makes certain hormones like vasopressin\\n\\nwhich is anti-diuretic hormone.\\n\\nAll of that functioning of the kidney\\n\\nis under strong regulation by so-called\\n\\ncircadian clock genes.\\n\\nCircadian clock genes are genes that are expressed\\n\\nin every cell, but that in certain cells of the body,\\n\\nvery strongly impact whether or not that organ,\\n\\nin this case, the kidney is going to be activated,\\n\\nmeaning functioning at a very high level\\n\\nor at a reduced level.\\n\\nAnd we can make all of this very simple\\n\\nby simply stating what's contained\\n\\nin this beautiful review that I'll provide a link to\\n\\nif you want to learn more called\\n\\nCircadian Rhythms in the Kidney.\\n\\nAnd basically what is known\\n\\nis that for the first 10 hours after waking,\\n\\nyour kidney is filtering fluid within your body\\n\\nat a very rapid rate.\\n\\nThere are a number of different cell types that do that,\\n\\nbut they are basically taking that fluid,\\n\\npulling out any contaminants,\\n\\nusing hormones such as anti-diuretic hormone, vasopressin\\n\\nto adjust whether or not you're going to hold on to fluid\\n\\nor release more fluid from your body in the form of urine\\n\\ndepending on the salt concentration,\\n\\ndepending on how much fluid you need, your workout put,\\n\\nthe conditions you're in, all of that.\\n\\nHowever, at about 10 hours after waking,\\n\\nyour kidney really starts to reduce\\n\\nits overall level of functioning.\\n\\nNow that doesn't mean that your kidney cannot filter fluid\\n\\n11 or 12 or 16 hours after waking,\\n\\nbut it becomes far less efficient at doing so.\\n\\nAnd thank goodness it does\\n\\nbecause you do not want your kidney filtering fluid\\n\\nat the same rate at midnight,\\n\\nassuming you wake up at say seven or eight or 9 a.m.,\\n\\nthat it was filtering fluid at 10 a.m.\\n\\nIn fact, we can say that if you want to reduce\\n\\nyour nighttime waking in order to urinate,\\n\\nwhich is a common, common question and concern\\n\\nthat many people have,\\n\\nhow can I avoid waking up in the middle of the night\\n\\nto urinate?\\n\\nAnd there I say, it's perfectly normal to wake up once,\\n\\nmaybe twice each night to urinate.\\n\\nBut if you want to reduce the number of times\\n\\nthat you wake up in order to urinate across the night,\\n\\nmaybe even make that number zero times,\\n\\nyou will greatly benefit by doing three things.\\n\\nFirst of all, make sure that you're hydrating sufficiently\\n\\nduring the daytime per the equations\\n\\nthat we talked about earlier.\\n\\nThat will ensure that you are not excessively thirsty\\n\\nin the evening and therefore consuming a lot more fluid.\\n\\nSecond, and related to that first point,\\n\\nis that you do want to reduce your fluid intake at night\\n\\nprovided you hydrated sufficiently throughout the day.\\n\\nAnd believe it or not,\\n\\nthe rate at which fluid moves from your gut\\n\\nand into the cells and tissues of your body\\n\\nand then from your bladder into urine\\n\\nis determined not just by the volume of fluid you ingest,\\n\\nbut also the rate at which you ingest that fluid.\\n\\nAnd you might be thinking, that's crazy.\\n\\nThat makes no sense at all, right?\\n\\nIf I drink a ton of fluid slowly,\\n\\ndoesn't it still mean that I'm going to urinate a ton?\\n\\nYes and no.\\n\\nIt also stands to reason that you might ask\\n\\nif I ingest very little fluid, but I do it very fast,\\n\\nis it going to be the case\\n\\nthat I'm going to urinate it out very quickly?\\n\\nWell, yes and no.\\n\\nThe point is that the fluid filtration systems of your body\\n\\nthat range from the gut to the bladder\\n\\nand include the kidney, of course,\\n\\ndepend not just on the volume,\\n\\nbut on the rate of fluid that you ingest.\\n\\nBecause of those mechanosensors that we talked about earlier,\\n\\nif you gulp down a bunch of fluids,\\n\\nyou are going to excrete those fluids more quickly\\n\\nthan if you sip them slowly, excuse me, sip them slowly.\\n\\nSo here's what I recommend.\\n\\nThroughout the day, when you're trying to get\\n\\nyour adequate yield of water or other beverages,\\n\\nfeel free to gulp that fluid or sip it.\\n\\nI'm a gulper, not a sipper,\\n\\nbut many of you are going to be sippers, not gulpers.\\n\\nConsume fluid at the rate that feels right to you,\\n\\nbut feel comfortable gulping that fluid.\\n\\nHowever, in the evening,\\n\\nif you are somebody who has challenges\\n\\nwith waking up excessively in the middle of the night,\\n\\nreduce your fluid intake,\\n\\nprovided you've hydrated properly throughout the day.\\n\\nAnd I suggest consuming no more than five,\\n\\nmaybe eight ounces of fluid\\n\\nbetween the time of 10 hours after waking\\n\\nand when you go to sleep.\\n\\nAgain, if you're very thirsty or you under hydrate\\n\\nor it's very hot, feel free to ingest more fluid, please.\\n\\nBut most people will find that if they reduce\\n\\ntheir fluid intake to about five ounces or less of fluid\\n\\nin that later part of the day,\\n\\nafter 10 hours of having woken up and before sleep,\\n\\nand they sip those beverages as opposed to gulping them,\\n\\nthat they will have fewer bouts of waking up\\n\\nin the middle of the night to go to the restroom\\n\\nand ideally zero.\\n\\nLet's talk about tap water.\\n\\nAnd here I have to take a deep breath,\\n\\nnot a deep gulp, but a deep breath,\\n\\nbecause in researching tap water\\n\\nand what's contained in tap water in different regions,\\n\\nnot just in the US, but around the world,\\n\\nI confess the picture is a pretty scary one.\\n\\nI want to be clear, I'm not somebody\\n\\nwho naturally orients towards fear or conspiracy theories.\\n\\nHowever, in researching tap water for this episode\\n\\nby way of looking at the peer-reviewed research,\\n\\nmeta-analyses, reviews, specific research articles\\n\\nwhere specific hypotheses were tested,\\n\\nand in talking with experts in toxicology and so on,\\n\\nit's a pretty grim picture, frankly,\\n\\nwhen one looks at what's contained in most tap water\\n\\nand whether or not the compounds\\n\\nthat are contained in tap water\\n\\nare present in sufficient concentrations\\n\\nto negatively impact our health.\\n\\nAnd the bad news is that much if not all tap water,\\n\\nbelieve it or not, much if not all tap water\\n\\ncontains things that are bad for the biology of our cells.\\n\\nThere is a silver lining, however,\\n\\nand the silver lining is that very simple steps\\n\\nthat are very inexpensive can be used\\n\\nto adjust that tap water to make it not just safe to drink,\\n\\nbut that makes it perfectly fine to drink.\\n\\nSo that's the good news, and we'll get to that in a moment.\\n\\nIf you are somebody who is interested\\n\\nin whether or not tap water contains things\\n\\nlike endocrine disruptors, hormone disruptors\\n\\nthat can negatively impact reproductive health\\n\\nin males or females or both, there's a wonderful review,\\n\\nwonderful because it's so thorough,\\n\\nalthough the news isn't great,\\n\\nit's very thorough, which is great,\\n\\nwhich is entitled Endocrine Disruptors in Water\\n\\nand their effects on the reproductive system.\\n\\nThis is a review from 2020 that analyzes water\\n\\nfrom a bunch of different sources within the world\\n\\nand essentially focuses on a few key components.\\n\\nFirst of all, it focuses on the concentration of minerals,\\n\\nthat is magnesium and calcium within water.\\n\\nMany people don't realize this,\\n\\nbut so-called hard water, sounds terrible, right?\\n\\nBut hard water is water that contains magnesium and calcium,\\n\\nwhich turns out to be a good thing.\\n\\nSome water contains more magnesium and calcium,\\n\\nother water contains less.\\n\\nThey looked at the presence of magnesium and calcium\\n\\nbecause that is going to impact the pH of water.\\n\\nIn general, the higher concentrations\\n\\nof magnesium and calcium in water, the higher the pH,\\n\\nthat is the more alkaline that water is\\n\\nand the lower levels of magnesium and calcium,\\n\\nthe more acidic or lower pH that water tends to be.\\n\\nThe other thing that this review addresses\\n\\nis the concentration of so-called DBPs,\\n\\ndog bulldog porcupines, DBPs,\\n\\nwhich are disinfection byproducts contained in water.\\n\\nSo obviously local governments, the government,\\n\\nwants your drinking water to be clean.\\n\\nThey don't want contaminants in it.\\n\\nThey don't want sewage in that water.\\n\\nThey don't want chemical contaminants\\n\\nthat are going to make people immediately sick.\\n\\nSo they treat water, water treatment plants,\\n\\ntreat water with disinfection products\\n\\nand those disinfection products create things\\n\\ncalled disinfection byproducts.\\n\\nAnd the presence of those DBPs\\n\\nor disinfectant byproducts can strongly impact\\n\\nthe pH of water by way of changing the concentrations\\n\\nof magnesium and calcium.\\n\\nPut differently, I do believe that governments\\n\\nare trying to provide people with clean water,\\n\\nbut in doing so, oftentimes we'll introduce things\\n\\nto that water that are not good for us.\\n\\nNow it's very clear that DBPs can cause endocrine disruption\\n\\nin ways that are not good for reproductive health.\\n\\nI did a very long, in fact, four and a half hour episode\\n\\non fertility and vitality.\\n\\nThat was male and female fertility, by the way,\\n\\nand vitality that again, you can find at hubermanlab.com\\n\\nthat talks about all the biological processes involved\\n\\nin the generation of healthy eggs and sperm\\n\\nand creating a healthy embryos,\\n\\nimplantation embryos and so forth.\\n\\nIt's very clear that DBPs have been shown\\n\\nto disrupt ovarian function, spermatogenesis\\n\\nand fertility outcomes.\\n\\nEven at concentrations of DBPs that are present\\n\\nin drinking water that comes from the tap.\\n\\nNow, does that mean that you shouldn't drink tap water?\\n\\nWell, the answer to that is a, it depends.\\n\\nWhat does it depend on?\\n\\nWell, it depends on several things.\\n\\nFirst of all, I highly recommend that everybody go online\\n\\nand put in your zip code and ask for a water analysis\\n\\nof water that comes out of the tap in that zip code.\\n\\nThis is something that is readily available online,\\n\\nat least to my knowledge.\\n\\nAnd unfortunately, there's no specific one site\\n\\nthat I can send everyone to,\\n\\nto get an in-depth analysis of the drinking water\\n\\nthat comes out of your tap.\\n\\nHowever, I highly recommend that you go online\\n\\nand put in your zip code or municipal area code\\n\\nand figure out whether or not your water contains\\n\\nX amount of DBPs or Y amount of DBPs.\\n\\nNow, of course, you're going to get a bunch of values back\\n\\nand unless you're a toxicologist,\\n\\nprobably not going to know what those values mean.\\n\\nBut what you're really looking for\\n\\nis whether or not there are high, low,\\n\\nor moderate levels of fluoride in that drinking water.\\n\\nWhy do I say that?\\n\\nWell, there are studies that show that the concentration\\n\\nof fluoride in drinking water is a particular concern\\n\\nfor the thyroid hormone system of the body.\\n\\nNow, thyroid hormone has a lot of different roles\\n\\nin brain and body, and thyroid hormone is very important\\n\\nfor everything from metabolism to levels of energy\\n\\nwhen thyroid levels are disrupted\\n\\nor if the thyroid receptors are disrupted,\\n\\nit can lead to depression.\\n\\nWhen thyroid hormones are optimized,\\n\\nit can lead to optimal mood if there is such a thing.\\n\\nBut in other words, it helps keep your mood elevated.\\n\\nIt relates to everything from sleep to reproduction.\\n\\nThyroid hormone is involved in many, many things,\\n\\nincluding bone health and tissue health generally.\\n\\nSo essentially every biological process in your body\\n\\nis impacted by thyroid hormone.\\n\\nAnd there's a study that I'd like to highlight,\\n\\nwhich was published in 2018,\\n\\nand the title of the study is Impact of Drinking Water\\n\\nFluoride on Human Thyroid Hormones.\\n\\nThis was a case control study,\\n\\nso this is not an extensive analysis of many individuals.\\n\\nHowever, what it shows is that fluoride\\n\\nnegatively impacts thyroid stimulating hormone\\n\\nand so-called T3 levels.\\n\\nSo you have thyroid hormone T3 and T4,\\n\\neven in the standard concentrations that are present of,\\n\\nand here's an important number, 0.5 milligrams per liter.\\n\\nOkay, so if you can get ahold of the fluoride concentrations\\n\\nin your tap water and find out whether or not\\n\\nthe concentrations are at, below,\\n\\nor exceed 0.5 milligrams per liter,\\n\\nwhat you will find is that even just 0.5 milligrams\\n\\nper liter of water can disrupt thyroid function.\\n\\nAnd this is going to be a particular concern\\n\\nfor people to have familial,\\n\\nso genetically related thyroid issues,\\n\\nor that are concerned with keeping\\n\\nyour thyroid hormone levels healthy,\\n\\nwhich I think is everybody.\\n\\nSo I am telling you that you should try and get ahold\\n\\nof some data about the water that comes out of your tap\\n\\nif you intend on drinking tap water,\\n\\nand probably even if you don't,\\n\\njust know what's in your drinking water.\\n\\nYour local government should provide that information\\n\\nand or it should be readily available online.\\n\\nAnd in particular, I think it's worthwhile\\n\\nto address how much fluoride is present\\n\\nin your drinking water.\\n\\nAgain, I don't want to create a lot of scare.\\n\\nI'm not trying to trigger fear here.\\n\\nI do think, however, by way of reading this review,\\n\\nby way of reading the paper\\n\\nthat I just referred to a moment ago,\\n\\nagain, links to these are going to be provided\\n\\nin the show note captions,\\n\\nthat there is extensive evidence\\n\\nthat elevated levels of fluoride in drinking water\\n\\nare simply not good for us.\\n\\nNow that could open a whole discussion\\n\\nof why fluoride is in our drinking water\\n\\nin the first place at all.\\n\\nBut leaving that aside, it seems to me\\n\\nthat most everybody should know how much fluoride\\n\\nis in their drinking water.\\n\\nAnd ideally everybody, yes, everybody\\n\\nis filtering their drinking water.\\n\\nNow that raises the question\\n\\nof how best to filter drinking water.\\n\\nAnd that brings an answer of,\\n\\nit depends on a couple of things.\\n\\nFirst of all, how healthy or unhealthy\\n\\ndo you know yourself to be?\\n\\nSo if you're somebody who has no health issues,\\n\\nyou have plenty of vigor, you're sleeping well at night,\\n\\nyou have no autoimmune disease,\\n\\nyou're not aware of any health concern, minor or major,\\n\\nwell then perhaps you're somebody\\n\\nthat doesn't want to filter your water.\\n\\nI would argue that why wouldn't you employ\\n\\nsome very low or even zero cost approach\\n\\nto filtering your water?\\n\\nThere are going to be other individuals\\n\\nwho are suffering particular ailments\\n\\nof brain or body or both\\n\\nthat absolutely should be filtering their drinking water\\n\\nif they're getting their drinking the water from their tap\\n\\nbecause it is pretty well established now\\n\\nthat tap water contains a lot of these disinfectant\\n\\nas well as in most cases,\\n\\nexceeding the threshold of fluoride\\n\\nthat we know to be healthy for us.\\n\\nHow should you filter your tap water?\\n\\nWell, you have everything ranging\\n\\nfrom the so-called Brita type filters to these.\\n\\nYou're going to be carbon type filters or other filters\\n\\nthat you essentially put over a container or a compartment\\n\\nwhere you can pour the water over it\\n\\nand goes into the compartment below.\\n\\nWill those work?\\n\\nAre they sufficient to filter out\\n\\nthe disinfectant byproducts?\\n\\nThe general answer is yes,\\n\\nprovided you change the filters often enough.\\n\\nHowever, it is not thought,\\n\\nunfortunately not thought\\n\\nthat they filter out sufficient fluoride.\\n\\nSo what I highly recommend is depending on your budget\\n\\nthat you go online and you search for at home water filters\\n\\nthat can filter out fluoride.\\n\\nThere are a number of straightforward\\n\\nand inexpensive tools to do that.\\n\\nAnd here I don't have any relationship\\n\\nto any of the water filters\\n\\nor things that I'm going to mention now.\\n\\nI want to be very clear about that.\\n\\nThere's no brand code or affiliation here.\\n\\nI'm simply trying to direct you to resources\\n\\nthat will allow you to filter your tap water\\n\\nfor it to be more safe for you to consume\\n\\nin a way that meets your budget\\n\\nwith the understanding that people have\\n\\nvery different disposable incomes.\\n\\nSo the range of costs here is going to be pretty tremendous.\\n\\nI just want to get that out of the way first.\\n\\nThere are water filters that you can use repeatedly.\\n\\nSo these are what I'll refer to as pitcher filters\\n\\nthat are less than a hundred dollars.\\n\\nNow, keep in mind that that's a one-time purchase\\n\\nexcept for the replacement of the filters,\\n\\nwhich fortunately doesn't have to be done too often.\\n\\nSo there are different filters.\\n\\nI'll provide a link to one that I found\\n\\nthat is at least by my read of the lowest possible cost.\\n\\nSo this is the so-called clearly filtered water pitcher\\n\\nwith affinity filtration.\\n\\nSo this is a filter that can adequately remove fluoride,\\n\\nlead, BPAs, glyphosates, hormones,\\n\\nand some of the other harmful things\\n\\nthat are contained in most tap water.\\n\\nAgain, I do realize that for some people,\\n\\neven an 80 US dollar cost is going to be prohibitive,\\n\\nbut do realize that what you're doing here\\n\\nis you're purchasing a unit\\n\\nthat can be used repeatedly over and over.\\n\\nThe reason why it's lower cost\\n\\nthan some of the different filtration approaches\\n\\nthat I'll talk about in a moment\\n\\nare that you can't really put all the drinking water\\n\\nthat you would use say for an entire week\\n\\nor for an entire month in one pitcher.\\n\\nYou're going to have to repeatedly pour water\\n\\ninto the pitcher in order to filter it.\\n\\nNow, as I mentioned before,\\n\\nthe range on water filter costs\\n\\nfor filters that can adequately remove fluoride\\n\\nand all the other things that you want\\n\\nout of your top water is immense.\\n\\nIn fact, you can find whole house water filters\\n\\nthat are $2,000 or more.\\n\\nAgain, these are going to be filters\\n\\nthat are going to be in your garage\\n\\nor in a laundry room that are going to basically pull\\n\\nfrom the piping system of your house\\n\\nand deliver purified water.\\n\\nTechnically it's not purified,\\n\\nbut that's removing these contaminants and fluoride\\n\\nfrom all the sinks in your house\\n\\nso you can effectively drink from any\\n\\nor all things in your house.\\n\\nThat's what explains the higher cost.\\n\\nI think most people are probably not going\\n\\nto have the disposable income\\n\\nor have the opportunity to include\\n\\none of these whole house filters.\\n\\nAlthough if you do have the means\\n\\nand it's important to you, you could do that.\\n\\nAnd then there are going to be\\n\\nwhat I would call intermediate systems.\\n\\nSo systems that cost somewhere between 200 and $500.\\n\\nProbably one of the more common ones\\n\\nor popular ones is a so-called Berkey filter system.\\n\\nThese are filter systems that again remove the things\\n\\nthat you want removed from your tap water\\n\\nand they can do it at higher volumes\\n\\nand they're typically countertop units.\\n\\nThey don't require any plug-in typically\\n\\nor they only require brief plug-in and electricity.\\n\\nAnd they're going to filter out many, many liters\\n\\nor tens of liters of water\\n\\nso that you can always have access\\n\\nto that clean filtered water any time or day or night\\n\\nwithout having to pour over into the pitcher.\\n\\nSo I mentioned these different options\\n\\nbecause again, I realized that people have different levels\\n\\nof disposable income.\\n\\nAs far as I know, there's no tablet\\n\\nor simple mechanism that can be purchased\\n\\nas a transportable, you know,\\n\\npill that you can just simply throw in water\\n\\nand remove the contaminants.\\n\\nIf anyone is aware of one\\n\\nthat can adequately remove fluoride and other contaminants,\\n\\nplease put in the comment section on YouTube.\\n\\nThat'd be the best place\\n\\nso that I and everyone else can see it.\\n\\nBut hopefully the mention\\n\\nof the different filtration systems that I mentioned\\n\\nwill give you some choices that I would hope would fall\\n\\nwithin the range that one could potentially afford.\\n\\nAn important note about filtration.\\n\\nJust as in our body, there are mechanisms\\n\\nto signal mechanical changes and chemical changes\\n\\nthat occur in our gut, in our brain, et cetera, elsewhere.\\n\\nAnd in general, both mechanical and chemical changes\\n\\nare signaled across the body to invoke different changes,\\n\\nwhether or not those are, you know,\\n\\na response of the immune system\\n\\nor to make us more alert or more asleep, et cetera.\\n\\nSo too filtration capitalizes\\n\\non mechanical and chemical filtration.\\n\\nWhat I mean by that is when you run a fluid,\\n\\nwater or any other fluid through a filter,\\n\\nthose filters are doing two things.\\n\\nThey are physically constraining\\n\\nwhich molecules can go through by creating portals,\\n\\npores that allow certain size molecules to go through\\n\\nand not others.\\n\\nAnd almost always they contain certain chemicals themselves.\\n\\nRight, those filters have been treated\\n\\nwith certain chemicals that neutralize\\n\\ncertain other chemicals, okay?\\n\\nSo you may be wondering how when you filter water,\\n\\nyou know, magnesium and calcium could get through\\n\\nbut fluoride doesn't.\\n\\nAnd that's because these filters\\n\\nhave been very cleverly designed\\n\\nin order to neutralize fluoride\\n\\nor to prevent large molecules such as sediment and dirt,\\n\\nwhich is kind of easy to imagine being filtered,\\n\\nbut also to allow certain small molecules like calcium,\\n\\nwhich is smallish or magnesium, which is smallish,\\n\\nto still pass through into our drinking water.\\n\\nAnd this is wonderful because what it means\\n\\nis that by filtering our water\\n\\nusing any of the methods that we talked about before,\\n\\nyou're still going to get whatever magnesium and calcium\\n\\nwas present in that water\\n\\nwhile still adequately removing the fluoride\\n\\nand other disinfectant byproducts.\\n\\nNow, what if you can't afford any of those options?\\n\\nOkay, well, here you have an interesting zero cost option.\\n\\nIt's not as good as the other ones of filtering that water,\\n\\nbut it is an option.\\n\\nAnd I do think it's important to give options\\n\\nto people who don't have any disposable income\\n\\nfor the purpose of filtering their water,\\n\\nwhich is to draw a gallon or five gallons\\n\\nor maybe even more tap water out of the tap\\n\\nand put it into some container, some vessel.\\n\\nSo it could be one gallon, five gallon, 10 gallon container.\\n\\nAnd then to let that tap water sit for some period of time\\n\\nto allow some of the sediment to drop to the bottom.\\n\\nNow you might say, well, there's no sediment.\\n\\nThere's nothing contained in that tap water\\n\\nand it isn't fluoride diluted in the water.\\n\\nAnd indeed the answer to that is yes.\\n\\nHowever, there is some evidence\\n\\nthat letting tap water sit out at room temperature\\n\\nand outside the pipes that deliver that water\\n\\ncan help remove some, not all of the contaminants\\n\\nin that water.\\n\\nIf however, you are filtering the water\\n\\nusing any of the methods that I talked about\\n\\na few moments ago, you do not need to do this.\\n\\nOkay, I realize there's a whole world out there\\n\\nof people who insist on putting their water in the sun\\n\\nor only keeping it in certain containers\\n\\nand putting it out for a few days before they ingest it.\\n\\nThat to me seems a bit extreme.\\n\\nIf you want to do that, be my guest,\\n\\nbut I don't think most people need to do that.\\n\\nHowever, I do believe that for people\\n\\nwho have zero disposable income to devote\\n\\nto paying for any kind of filtration system\\n\\nfor their tap water, that taking that tap water\\n\\nand putting into some container at room temperature\\n\\nand keeping it at room temperature\\n\\nfor a half day or a day or more.\\n\\nAnd then pouring off the top two thirds of that water\\n\\ninto another container and consuming the water\\n\\nfrom that second container is going to remove some,\\n\\nnot all of the contaminants\\n\\nthat one would need to be concerned about.\\n\\nAnd here I should mention something\\n\\nthat I neglected to mention a few moments ago.\\n\\nIf you're going to do this zero cost option\\n\\nand let the water sit out for a bit,\\n\\nyou would want that water to sit uncapped.\\n\\nSorry, I should have mentioned that before, uncapped.\\n\\nOf course, trying to keep things\\n\\nfrom falling into that water.\\n\\nIn fact, you could even put a little bit of cloth above it.\\n\\nSo you don't want things falling into that water,\\n\\nbut you want certain things to be able to evaporate off.\\n\\nAnd you also want some of the sediment to drop down.\\n\\nAnd the reason why this process\\n\\nof letting water sit out would work at all\\n\\nis because many of the contaminants contained within water\\n\\nare not present because of the source of that water\\n\\nor even the treatment of that water,\\n\\nbut rather because of the pipes that that water arrives\\n\\nto your glass or the pot that you have from.\\n\\nOkay, and here again, there's an infinite number of variables.\\n\\nSo some people are living in buildings\\n\\nfor which the pipes are very, very old,\\n\\nbut very, very clean, believe it or not.\\n\\nSome people are living in newer buildings and structures\\n\\nthat have new pipes,\\n\\nbut for which the seals between those pipes contain things\\n\\nthat are not good for you to consume.\\n\\nSo by letting water sit out for a while,\\n\\nyou're able to remove some of the contaminants present\\n\\nwithin the pipes of your home and the building\\n\\nand even the pipes that lead to your home or apartment.\\n\\nNow, some people get really obsessed\\n\\nwith this whole tap water thing\\n\\nand really want to find out all the details about the pipes\\n\\nand what sorts of hard metals and how much magnesium\\n\\nand how much calcium are present in their water.\\n\\nThere are ways that you can test your drinking water\\n\\nfor those sorts of things.\\n\\nMost people I realize, including myself,\\n\\nare simply not going to do that.\\n\\nIf you want to know what I do,\\n\\nI tend to drink water that is filtered\\n\\nthrough one of these lower cost filters,\\n\\nor if I'm going to be consuming a lot of fluid,\\n\\nI will drink certain kinds of fluid that later I'll tell you,\\n\\nI've been doing an experiment for sake of this episode\\n\\nlooking at so-called molecular hydrogen water,\\n\\nwhich sounds very fancy and esoteric\\n\\nand almost a little wacky,\\n\\nbut it turns out it has largely to do\\n\\nwith the amount of magnesium and calcium\\n\\nand the pH of that water.\\n\\nSo if you are somebody who has a very low budget\\n\\nor simply just wants to spend a very small amount of money\\n\\nand try and still drink tap water,\\n\\nthere is absolutely a way to do that safely,\\n\\nbut it does require a few of these steps.\\n\\nSo on the topic of magnesium and calcium,\\n\\nthis relates, as I mentioned earlier,\\n\\nto the quote unquote hardness of water.\\n\\nSo what of the hardness of water?\\n\\nIs it better to have more magnesium and calcium\\n\\nin your water or less?\\n\\nSome people don't like the taste of hard water.\\n\\nThey prefer the taste of water\\n\\nthat has less magnesium and calcium.\\n\\nHowever, there I would encourage you to take a step back\\n\\nand consider some of the literature.\\n\\nIn fact, I'll mention a paper in particular now\\n\\npublished in 2019, which describes the quote,\\n\\nregulations for calcium, magnesium,\\n\\nor hardness in drinking water\\n\\nin the European Union member states.\\n\\nTurns out in Europe, they do very detailed water analysis\\n\\nand that's present in a number\\n\\nof really high qualities scientific publications.\\n\\nThis was a paper published\\n\\nin regulatory toxicology and pharmacology.\\n\\nAnd they cite a number of different references\\n\\nin the introduction that for instance,\\n\\nand here I'm quoting,\\n\\nstatistically significant inverse association\\n\\nbetween magnesium and cardiovascular mortality.\\n\\nNow again, that's an association, this is not causal,\\n\\nbut higher magnesium in water,\\n\\nlower cardiovascular mortality.\\n\\nThey go on to say the highest exposure category,\\n\\nwhich are people consuming drinking water\\n\\nwith magnesium contents of 8.3 to 19.4 milligrams per liter.\\n\\nAgain, when you get your water analysis,\\n\\nyou can compare against some of these values,\\n\\nwas significantly associated with decreased likelihood\\n\\nof cardiovascular mortality by 25%\\n\\ncompared with people consuming magnesium content\\n\\nof 2.5 to 8.2 milligrams per liter.\\n\\nOkay, so what this basically shows,\\n\\nand by the way, the reference to that,\\n\\nI'll also provide a link to in the show note caption.\\n\\nWhat this basically states is that higher magnesium\\n\\ncontaining water, and it turns out higher magnesium\\n\\nand calcium in containing water, so-called harder water,\\n\\nmay not taste as good to you,\\n\\nbut turns out to be better for you.\\n\\nNow, whether or not it can prevent you\\n\\nfrom getting cardiovascular disease, I don't know.\\n\\nIn fact, I would probably just state no,\\n\\nit probably won't prevent you from cardiovascular disease.\\n\\nYou still need to do all the other things\\n\\nthat are important for avoiding cardiovascular disease\\n\\nand cerebrovascular disease.\\n\\nFor that and what to do\\n\\nin order to avoid cardiovascular disease,\\n\\nI strongly encourage you to listen to the episode\\n\\nwith Dr. Peter Attia that's coming out in a few weeks\\n\\nthat gets deep into that topic and the actionable items\\n\\nfor avoiding cardiovascular disease.\\n\\nBut basically, as this study quotes,\\n\\nthere is a growing consensus among epidemiologists\\n\\nand epidemiological evidence,\\n\\nalong with clinical and nutritional evidence\\n\\nthat's strong enough to suggest\\n\\nthat new guidance should be issued\\n\\nin terms of how these different sources of tap water\\n\\nshould enhance, not deplete,\\n\\nthe amount of magnesium and calcium in that water.\\n\\nNow, this ought to raise a very important question\\n\\nin all of your minds,\\n\\nwhich is why is it that magnesium and calcium concentrations\\n\\nare relevant to cardiovascular disease?\\n\\nIs it something about what magnesium does in cells\\n\\nor what calcium does in cells?\\n\\nAre we all magnesium and calcium deficient?\\n\\nWell, it turns out that's not the case.\\n\\nThe major effect by which magnesium and calcium in water\\n\\nare likely to impact things like blood pressure,\\n\\ncardiovascular disease,\\n\\nand other aspects of cellular function\\n\\nturn out to be somewhat cryptic,\\n\\nbut we can make that cryptic aspect very clear\\n\\nby saying that when we have more magnesium in particular,\\n\\nbut also calcium present in our water,\\n\\nso-called hard water,\\n\\nyou increase the amount of hydrogen in that water,\\n\\nit becomes what we call hydrogen rich,\\n\\nand the pH of that water is increased.\\n\\nNow, again, this does not mean that we are trying\\n\\nto change the pH of the cells of our body\\n\\nin any kind of meaningful way.\\n\\nIn fact, we don't want to do that.\\n\\nWe want the pH of the cells of our body\\n\\nto stay in particular ranges, as I mentioned earlier,\\n\\nbut having more magnesium and more calcium in our water,\\n\\nthat is increasing the hardness of our water,\\n\\nchanges the pH of that water,\\n\\nand it turns out that the elevated pH of water,\\n\\nthat is pH of water that tends to be somewhere\\n\\nbetween high sevens,\\n\\nso we could say 7.9 up to even nine or 9.2,\\n\\nis going to be more readily absorbed\\n\\nand is going to more favorably impact\\n\\nthe function of our cells than lower pH water.\\n\\nAgain, I want to restate this\\n\\nbecause I'm a little bit concerned\\n\\nthat maybe a clip of this is going to be taken\\n\\nand sent elsewhere,\\n\\nand someone will get the impression\\n\\nthat I'm saying that we actually want to drink high pH water,\\n\\nthat we all need to buy expensive high pH water.\\n\\nTurns out that's not the case.\\n\\nIf you're consuming tap water\\n\\nfrom a location where levels of a magnesium\\n\\nare sufficiently high in that tap water,\\n\\nagain, where the level of magnesium\\n\\nis 8.3 to 19.4 milligrams per liter of water,\\n\\nthat is if the water coming out of your tap is hard enough,\\n\\nwell, then chances are you don't need\\n\\nto enhance the pH of that water\\n\\nor change its magnesium concentration.\\n\\nIf, however, the water that you're drinking\\n\\nfrom the tap, filtered or not, I would hope filtered,\\n\\ncontains less than 8.3 milligrams per liter of magnesium,\\n\\nwell, then chances are the pH of that water\\n\\nis going to be low enough\\n\\nthat it's not going to be lending itself\\n\\nto some of the favorable health components\\n\\nthat higher pH water can.\\n\\nNotice I did not say that lower pH,\\n\\nAKA more acidic water, is bad for you.\\n\\nI didn't say that.\\n\\nI said that higher pH water can be good for you.\\n\\nSo let's talk about how and why higher pH water\\n\\ncan be good for you and some of the best\\n\\nand in fact, very inexpensive sources\\n\\nof higher pH magnesium enhanced\\n\\nor simply tap water that contains sufficient magnesium\\n\\ncan be used and accessed.\\n\\nMany of you are probably wondering whether or not\\n\\nyou can simply boil your tap water\\n\\nand thereby decontaminate the tap water.\\n\\nThere, I want to caution you.\\n\\nIt turns out that some of the contaminants present in water\\n\\nare actually made worse by heating water\\n\\nand again, I don't want to open up\\n\\na whole catalog of different fears.\\n\\nI, like all of you, I presume, use water to cook,\\n\\npasta, rice, because I'm an omnivore,\\n\\nI do consume those things.\\n\\nI confess if I make yerba mate or any kind of tea or coffee,\\n\\nI tend to use a higher quality water source\\n\\nthan tap water even if that tap water is filtered\\n\\nbecause I like the taste far more\\n\\nif I use a really good source of water\\n\\nand again, because I'm not consuming those beverages\\n\\nin enormous volumes,\\n\\nthat becomes a relatively inexpensive endeavor\\n\\nbut I would caution people against using boiling\\n\\nor heating of water as the only method\\n\\nto decontaminate their tap water\\n\\nand instead to also rely on some of the filtration systems\\n\\nthat I talked about before.\\n\\nAnd as long as we're talking about the temperature of water,\\n\\nthere is sort of an ongoing debate online.\\n\\nIt's not a huge debate\\n\\nbut a number of people engaged in this debate\\n\\nas to whether or not drinking really cold water\\n\\nor room temperature water is better for you\\n\\nor worse for you.\\n\\nThis is a tough one to resolve.\\n\\nIt turns out that if water is very, very cold,\\n\\nthat is if you drink it and you can feel that cold water\\n\\nmaking its way down to your gut\\n\\nand you can actually feel it as cold within your gut\\n\\nand that's sort of a, you know, back of the envelope\\n\\nor I should say direct within the gut measure\\n\\nof cold versus body temperature water\\n\\nthat it is going to be slower to absorb.\\n\\nThat is you're going to feel it sloshing around\\n\\nin your stomach for a bit longer\\n\\nthan if you were to consume water that is slightly warmer.\\n\\nNow that is not to say that you should ingest warm water\\n\\nor room temperature water.\\n\\nHowever, many people find that when they drink\\n\\nvery cold water or ice water,\\n\\nthat indeed it can alter the kind of sensation\\n\\nof the lining of their stomach in ways that\\n\\nat least to them feel like it's altering their digestion.\\n\\nAnd that makes sense.\\n\\nThe cells that line the gut are very temperature sensitive.\\n\\nYou want this.\\n\\nSo for a number of reasons,\\n\\nincluding not consuming food that is excessively hot\\n\\nor cold or damaging your gut.\\n\\nBut in general, most people know the temperature of fluid\\n\\nthat they want to ingest\\n\\nand ingest that temperature of fluid.\\n\\nSo most people, for instance, on a cold day\\n\\nwant a warm or hot fluid.\\n\\nDoes that mean that you're not going to absorb\\n\\nthat warm or hot fluid?\\n\\nNo, of course it doesn't.\\n\\nYou're going to absorb that fluid one way or the other.\\n\\nSo drink fluids at the temperatures that are\\n\\nto your liking in that moment.\\n\\nIn other words, what you desire in that moment.\\n\\nAnd don't worry so much about trying to avoid\\n\\ncold beverages or trying to make sure\\n\\nthat you're always consuming room temperature water\\n\\nas opposed to cold water.\\n\\nSo now with your understanding of hard water, soft water,\\n\\nmagnesium, the relationship between magnesium, calcium\\n\\nand the pH of water.\\n\\nAnd remember our earlier conversation where we talked\\n\\nabout how higher pH water is actually going to move\\n\\nout of the gut and into the body a bit more readily\\n\\nand across those aquaporin channels more readily\\n\\nthan lower pH, more acidic water.\\n\\nWell, that raises the question of whether or not\\n\\nall these different forms of water that are out there,\\n\\nreverse osmosis water, distilled water,\\n\\ndouble distilled water, deuterium depleted water,\\n\\nalkaline water, as it's often called,\\n\\nwhether or not any or all of that has meaningful\\n\\nhealth outcomes.\\n\\nHere we can address some of those items pretty quickly.\\n\\nFor instance, distilled water and double distilled water\\n\\nis essentially distilled of that is it has magnesium\\n\\nand calcium removed from it.\\n\\nSo my recommendation would be to not drink distilled water.\\n\\nThere may be specific circumstances where somebody has\\n\\nvery high levels of blood magnesium or calcium\\n\\nor calcium stores within the body that would necessitate\\n\\nthem drinking only distilled water.\\n\\nBut that seems like a very isolated kind of niche case.\\n\\nSo in general, consuming distilled water\\n\\nis just simply not necessary.\\n\\nNow, in terms of reverse osmosis water,\\n\\nwhat is reverse osmosis water?\\n\\nReverse osmosis water is water that has been passed\\n\\nrepeatedly through a series of filters that are designed\\n\\nto remove the kinds of contaminants\\n\\nwe were talking about earlier.\\n\\nSo some of the basic contaminants\\n\\nlike disinfectant byproducts, fluoride,\\n\\nand some other large and small molecules\\n\\nthat leaves the water ideally still containing magnesium\\n\\nand calcium, although there's some evidence\\n\\nthat reverse osmosis water can deprive water\\n\\nof some of the magnesium and calcium.\\n\\nSo if you are going to use reverse osmosis filters\\n\\nand drink reverse osmosis water,\\n\\nyou want to make sure that you're still getting\\n\\nthe magnesium concentrations present in that water\\n\\nthat we talked about earlier.\\n\\nBut in general, reverse osmosis water is considered safe,\\n\\nbut, and for many people, this is going to be an important\\n\\nbut very expensive to access.\\n\\nThe reverse osmosis filters require a lot of changing\\n\\nof the filters, purchasing reverse osmosis water\\n\\nin its stable form within containers.\\n\\nThese are typically glass containers.\\n\\nIt's going to be pretty expensive\\n\\nand prohibitive for most people.\\n\\nThat said, there are a number of people out there\\n\\nthat really like the taste of reverse osmosis water.\\n\\nThey report it as feeling more smooth.\\n\\nThey think of reverse osmosis water\\n\\nas quote unquote, giving them energy.\\n\\nTo be quite honest, there's no direct studies\\n\\nof the subjective sensation of water in the mouth\\n\\nand in the gut and its relative health effects.\\n\\nAgain, the smoothness of water as one drinks it\\n\\nand goes down the gut, it really has no direct relationship\\n\\nto the quote unquote, hardness or softness of water.\\n\\nI know that's going to shock a number of you.\\n\\nYou probably think, well, hard water\\n\\nis going to be hard to drink.\\n\\nAnd it turns out that's not the case.\\n\\nIn fact, many people find that with elevated levels\\n\\nof magnesium and calcium in water,\\n\\nit actually tastes smoother or softer in their mouth.\\n\\nSo hard water tastes smooth or soft.\\n\\nI know it's all very counterintuitive,\\n\\nbut I think it's important to point this out\\n\\nbecause a number of times you'll hear or read\\n\\nabout filtering water so that it tastes smoother and better.\\n\\nAnd oftentimes that's happening\\n\\nbecause the quote unquote, hardness of water,\\n\\nthat is the concentrations of magnesium and calcium\\n\\nare actually increasing.\\n\\nSo if you're somebody who's curious\\n\\nabout reverse osmosis water and you can afford the filters\\n\\nor the reverse osmosis water already pre-filtered,\\n\\nplease be my guest, drink it.\\n\\nI'm certainly not trying to prevent anyone from drinking it.\\n\\nBut there's no peer reviewed evidence that I am aware of\\n\\nthat conclusively shows that drinking\\n\\na reverse osmosis water is far better for us\\n\\nthan drinking other types of water,\\n\\nprovided the other types of water\\n\\nare adequately filtered of fluoride\\n\\nand the sorts of disinfectant byproducts\\n\\nthat we talked about earlier.\\n\\nSo what about hydrogen water?\\n\\nYou may have heard of this or hydrogen enriched water\\n\\nor electrolyzed reduced water\\n\\nas a way to access hydrogen enriched water.\\n\\nAll this might sound pretty crazy to some of you.\\n\\nNow, fortunately for sake of today's discussion,\\n\\nwe can take a number of different categories of,\\n\\nlet's call it unique categories of water\\n\\nthat have been described, including deuterium depleted water.\\n\\nAnd by the way, deuterium is something that relates\\n\\nto the presence of hydrogen ions in water.\\n\\nAnd put very simply, water that is extracted from sources\\n\\nthat are closer to sea level tend to have more deuterium\\n\\nin them than water that is extracted from sources\\n\\nfurther from sea level.\\n\\nSo up in the mountains, for instance,\\n\\nand from springs further away from oceans.\\n\\nAs you get closer to sea level,\\n\\nthe sources of water separate from sea water\\n\\ntend to have more deuterium,\\n\\nwhich relates to the enrichment\\n\\nor lack of hydrogen within that water\\n\\nor free hydrogen within that water.\\n\\nI warned you, this was all going to sound pretty niche\\n\\nand that we were going to get a little bit into the chemistry,\\n\\nbut now I'm going to make it all very simple for you,\\n\\nat least for the non-officiant auto.\\n\\nElectrolyzed reduced water,\\n\\nwhich is a method of using electricity\\n\\nto alter the confirmation of the water molecules\\n\\nand their rates of movement as well,\\n\\nas well as so-called hydrogen rich water\\n\\nor hydrogen enriched water or deuterium depleted water\\n\\nall have the property of having higher levels of pH\\n\\nthan other forms of water,\\n\\nsuch as distilled water, reverse osmosis water,\\n\\nand generally higher pH than the kind of water\\n\\nthat comes out of your tap,\\n\\nunless you live in a region where your tap water\\n\\nhas very high levels of magnesium in it,\\n\\nwhich does occur in certain regions of the world,\\n\\nbut is not that common.\\n\\nMore typically, the water that comes out of your tap\\n\\ndoes not have enough magnesium,\\n\\nmeaning not as much magnesium in it as you would like.\\n\\nAnd this, I believe,\\n\\nexplains in a fairly straightforward way\\n\\nwhy there is such an appeal of these pH enhanced\\n\\nor alkaline waters or electrolyzed reduced water\\n\\nor deuterium depleted water.\\n\\nThere are a couple of reasons, but first of all,\\n\\nanytime someone is consuming a specialized form of water,\\n\\nchances are it's going to be filtered\\n\\nof the disinfectant byproducts, fluoride,\\n\\nand the other things that you really don't want in water.\\n\\nSo already the water is going to be cleaner\\n\\nthan would be coming out of the tap.\\n\\nSo that's going to indirectly explain\\n\\na number of the so-called health benefits,\\n\\nboth subjective and perhaps even objective,\\n\\nas we'll talk about,\\n\\nthat can result from consuming these other,\\n\\nlet's say more esoteric forms of water,\\n\\nat least not of simple tap water.\\n\\nHowever, if you look at hydrogen or hydrogen enriched water,\\n\\nyou really need to take a step back and ask, what is that?\\n\\nWhat are we really talking about?\\n\\nBecause it turns out that you can create\\n\\nhydrogen enriched water by putting tablets\\n\\nof magnesium itself, small amounts of magnesium,\\n\\ndissolving those in water,\\n\\nit will give off a kind of gaseous solution.\\n\\nYou'll see a bunch of bubbling in there.\\n\\nYou certainly want to dilute that tablet\\n\\nand then consume the water.\\n\\nAnd yes, it's true.\\n\\nWhat you've heard about in red\\n\\nfrom these commercial sources,\\n\\nyou do want to consume that water within about five\\n\\nto 15 minutes after that tablet completes dissolving.\\n\\nNow, why would you do this?\\n\\nAnd I should say that I have now started doing this,\\n\\nnot because I necessarily think\\n\\nthat it's so necessary or so beneficial.\\n\\nI'll talk about my experience in a moment.\\n\\nI did it in anticipation of this episode\\n\\nbecause I was researching water and hydrogen enriched water\\n\\nand all these alkaline waters.\\n\\nAnd what became very clear to me\\n\\nbased on reading a fantastic two-part review,\\n\\nit's a very extensive review entitled,\\n\\nor at least the first part is entitled,\\n\\nElectrolyzed Reduced Water Molecular Hydrogen\\n\\nis the exclusive agent responsible\\n\\nfor the therapeutic effects.\\n\\nAnd then there's a second part to this review.\\n\\nThis is how extensive it is entitled,\\n\\nElectrolyzed Reduced Water.\\n\\nNumber two, safety concerns and effectiveness\\n\\nas a source of hydrogen water.\\n\\nWhat this review, which we've linked to in the show notes,\\n\\npoints to is that all of the health benefits\\n\\nof these different forms of water\\n\\nthat you hear about out there,\\n\\ndeuterium depleted, hydrogen enriched, et cetera,\\n\\nall seem to boil down, no pun intended,\\n\\nno boiling included, I should say,\\n\\nto the elevation in hydrogen that translates into,\\n\\nand here's the really meaningful change,\\n\\nthe elevation in pH that occurs\\n\\nwhen you hydrogen enrich water.\\n\\nNow, there are not a lot of clinical studies\\n\\nlooking at hydrogen enriched water,\\n\\nbut there are starting to be more than a few.\\n\\nAnd one that I'd like to point out and that we'll link to\\n\\nwas published fairly recently,\\n\\nwhich is entitled,\\n\\nHydrogen Rich Water Reduces Inflammatory Responses\\n\\nand Prevents Apoptosis.\\n\\nApoptosis is a naturally occurring cell death\\n\\nduring development and is generally used\\n\\nto describe cell death of the body.\\n\\nSometimes this can be good cell death, by the way,\\n\\nremoving cells that need to be removed.\\n\\nAgain, the title of the paper is,\\n\\nHydrogen Rich Water Reduces Inflammatory Responses\\n\\nand Prevents Apoptosis of Peripheral Blood Cells\\n\\nin Healthy Adults,\\n\\na Randomized Double Blind Control Trial.\\n\\nNow, this paper looked at the effects\\n\\nof drinking 1.5 liters per day of hydrogen enriched water\\n\\nfor a period of four weeks.\\n\\nThey did find significant positive benefits\\n\\nof reduced inflammation,\\n\\nand they found these changes by way of analyzing things\\n\\nlike interleukin-6 and some of the other interleukins,\\n\\nwhich are markers of inflammation.\\n\\nThey controlled very nicely for the fact\\n\\nthat people were still consuming other forms of water\\n\\nand liquid and coffee, et cetera,\\n\\nalthough they made sure that they weren't consuming\\n\\ntoo much coffee and soda\\n\\nin addition to this hydrogen enriched water.\\n\\nBut what this paper shows is that indeed,\\n\\nincreasing the free hydrogen in water\\n\\ncan improve certain health metrics in these cells.\\n\\nAnd this is in keeping with some of the subjective reports\\n\\nthat people have stated out there,\\n\\nand that I myself experienced,\\n\\nI have to say that by drinking hydrogen rich water,\\n\\nwhich I'll tell you how to do fairly inexpensively\\n\\nin a moment, you do get the subjective experience\\n\\nof having more energy, of feeling better, quote unquote.\\n\\nNow, keep in mind, of course,\\n\\nthe placebo effect is a very real and powerful effect,\\n\\nso it could just be placebo.\\n\\nAlthough in this paper,\\n\\nthey did of course include a placebo group,\\n\\nso people didn't know if they were getting\\n\\nhydrogen rich water or non-hydrogen rich water.\\n\\nI should also mention that the improvements\\n\\nin health metrics that they observed in this study\\n\\nwere only observed for individuals older than 30 years old.\\n\\nWhy that is, I don't know.\\n\\nThe conclusions these authors came to\\n\\nin terms of how these individuals older than 30\\n\\nachieved lower levels, or I should say reduced levels\\n\\nof inflammation and improved markers\\n\\nof other aspects of biological function\\n\\nis that the hydrogen water improved\\n\\nthe biological antioxidant potential of certain cell types.\\n\\nAnd again, the cell types that they mainly focus on\\n\\nwere these peripheral blood cells in this particular study.\\n\\nNow, how could this be?\\n\\nWhy would this be?\\n\\nWell, this goes back to our earlier discussion\\n\\nabout reduction in reactive oxygen species,\\n\\nso-called ROSs, and reductions in free radicals\\n\\nthat can damage cells.\\n\\nSo if all of this is sounding very convoluted,\\n\\nI can understand why.\\n\\nHowever, what I like about this study\\n\\nand the two reviews that I mentioned a moment ago\\n\\nis that these studies don't really say\\n\\nthat hydrogen rich water is what's essential.\\n\\nWhat these studies really point to\\n\\nis that the changes in pH of water\\n\\nthat enhancing the hydrogen in water can create\\n\\nis what leads to the enhanced either absorption\\n\\nand or ability of cells to utilize that higher pH water.\\n\\nAgain, not by changing the pH of the body or of cells,\\n\\nbut simply because higher pH water,\\n\\nor we could perhaps more accurately state,\\n\\nless acidic water, that is harder water\\n\\nthat contains more magnesium and calcium\\n\\nseems to be more readily used by the cells of the body.\\n\\nAnd therefore, it's very likely that the individuals\\n\\nin this study were achieving higher\\n\\nor more efficient levels of hydration.\\n\\nOkay, so if any of this is confusing, let me be very clear.\\n\\nI do not believe that we all need\\n\\nto drink deuterium depleted water,\\n\\nor that we all need to drink electrolyze reduced water,\\n\\nnor do I necessarily believe\\n\\nthat we all need to drink hydrogen rich water.\\n\\nHowever, it's very clear to me\\n\\nthat all these different forms of water are better absorbed\\n\\nand therefore lead to better and more efficient hydration,\\n\\nand therefore can reduce inflammation, blood pressure,\\n\\nand improve a number of other health metrics\\n\\nbecause of the elevated pH\\n\\nthat all of these different purification\\n\\nor water treatment methods achieve.\\n\\nAnd that elevated pH, again,\\n\\nis not changing the pH of the cells and tissues\\n\\nand organs of your body.\\n\\nYou actually don't want that.\\n\\nRather, that elevated pH is simply making the water\\n\\nless acidic than it would be otherwise.\\n\\nSo the simple takeaway is this.\\n\\nIf your tap water contains sufficient magnesium\\n\\nper the values that we talked about earlier,\\n\\nI don't think you need to hydrogen enrich your water.\\n\\nI do, however, suggest that you at least analyze your water\\n\\nor look at some of the professional analysis of water\\n\\nthat you can achieve online\\n\\nand filter out disinfectant byproducts and fluorides,\\n\\net cetera, from that magnesium,\\n\\nor I should say sufficiently magnesium-containing water.\\n\\nPut simply, if your tap water has enough magnesium,\\n\\nfilter it, but drink it, and I think you're doing just fine.\\n\\nIf, however, the levels of magnesium in your tap water\\n\\nare not above that value that we talked about earlier,\\n\\nin that case, I do think,\\n\\nand I can completely understand why\\n\\nenriching the amount of hydrogen in that water\\n\\ncan make that water not only more palatable, right?\\n\\nGive you the sensation that it's softer or smoother\\n\\nor more enjoyable to drink than more acidic water would be,\\n\\nbut also that that water is going to be far more effective\\n\\nin being absorbed and hydrating the cells\\n\\nand tissues of your body, which turns out\\n\\nto be very important for an enormous range,\\n\\nperhaps every biological function\\n\\nwithin your brain and body.\\n\\nSo how can you hydrogen enrich your water?\\n\\nThat actually can be done fairly inexpensively.\\n\\nI've been doing that, as I mentioned earlier,\\n\\nas part of an experiment in preparation for this episode,\\n\\nbecause it turns out that the water\\n\\nthat comes out of my tap has very little magnesium in it\\n\\nand very little calcium as well.\\n\\nThe way to create hydrogen-rich water\\n\\nis you can simply purchase molecular hydrogen tablets,\\n\\nwhich in reality are just magnesium tablets\\n\\nthat dissolve in water and create a free hydrogen\\n\\nthat can interact with the other water molecules.\\n\\nNow, the chemistry behind it has been substantiated,\\n\\nand I'll provide a link in the show note captions\\n\\nto a paper that gets into some fairly extensive detail\\n\\nabout the way that having an additional hydrogen\\n\\nin your water can adjust the flow of electrons\\n\\nand the adjustment of free radicals.\\n\\nBut keep in mind, again, this is all through increases\\n\\nin the pH of your water.\\n\\nAnd please keep in mind that you can't simply take\\n\\nany other or any old magnesium tablet or capsule\\n\\nand put it into water.\\n\\nThe configuration of the magnesium in these capsules\\n\\nand tablets is such that it allows a rapid dissolving\\n\\nof the tablet and the activation of the free hydrogen\\n\\nthat can interact with the water molecules.\\n\\nAgain, there are only a few scientific studies\\n\\nexploring the real biological effects\\n\\nof these activated hydrogen waters.\\n\\nThe dissolvable tablets are the far less expensive way\\n\\nto go than purchasing prepackaged\\n\\nand sealed hydrogen water.\\n\\nIn fact, I don't recommend those brands\\n\\nbecause they are quite expensive\\n\\nand it's not clear how stable the activated\\n\\nor free hydrogen is in those waters.\\n\\nIn any case, this is certainly not something\\n\\nthat everyone needs to do.\\n\\nI mention it because I have had a good experience\\n\\nwith it myself.\\n\\nI also will mention again that I have no business\\n\\nor affiliation to any of these products.\\n\\nI'll provide a link to a few of them\\n\\nin the show note captions for those of you\\n\\nthat want to experiment.\\n\\nAnd indeed, that's why I'm telling you this.\\n\\nFor those of you that want to experiment\\n\\nwith raising the pH of your water\\n\\nwithout having to purchase what is ordinarily\\n\\nquite expensive, higher pH water,\\n\\nyou can do this with these dissolvable magnesium tablets.\\n\\nMy experience with them has been quite good.\\n\\nIn fact, I plan to continue to use them once or twice a day.\\n\\nThis is not the sort of thing that you need to do\\n\\nin all the water that you drink.\\n\\nI want to repeat, even if you go down this path\\n\\nand you find that you really like\\n\\nthe activated hydrogen tablet approach,\\n\\nit is not the case that you want to put these\\n\\nin all of your water.\\n\\nAnd you certainly don't want to put them\\n\\nin carbonated waters of any kind\\n\\nthat will lead to a lot of gastric discomfort,\\n\\nnor do you want to put them into hot liquids of any kind.\\n\\nSo again, this is the sort of thing that you do once\\n\\nor twice, maybe three times a day.\\n\\nAnd you can find out for yourself\\n\\nand measure subjectively whether or not you like\\n\\nthe experience and whether or not you quote unquote\\n\\nfeel better.\\n\\nNow, earlier in the episode,\\n\\nwe were discussing structured water\\n\\nor this fourth phase of water.\\n\\nI know a number of people out there are curious\\n\\nas to whether or not ingesting structured water\\n\\nis somehow better for us than ingesting non-structured water.\\n\\nAll I can say about this is that\\n\\nit is a very controversial thing to suggest\\n\\nthat structured water is somehow more biologically effective\\n\\nor better for us than non-structured water.\\n\\nThere are a number of different ways\\n\\nthat one can create structured water.\\n\\nThey involve some pretty extensive\\n\\nand expensive at-home systems ranging anywhere\\n\\nfrom a couple of hundred dollars\\n\\nto a couple of thousand dollars or more.\\n\\nTo be quite direct,\\n\\nwhen one goes into the peer-reviewed scientific literature,\\n\\none will not find, that is,\\n\\nthere is essentially no real evidence\\n\\nthat ingesting structured water\\n\\nleads to any specific desired biological outcomes.\\n\\nAs I say that, I'm sure there are people out there\\n\\nwho have still had tremendous experiences\\n\\ningesting structured water,\\n\\nwhether or not that's due to a placebo effect\\n\\nor a real effect of ingesting structured water isn't clear.\\n\\nJust to give you a sense of what my stance is\\n\\non things like structured water,\\n\\nI think that they are interesting and intriguing,\\n\\nbut as a scientist,\\n\\nin the absence of any quality peer-reviewed data at present,\\n\\nI can't really suggest that people go out\\n\\nand start ingesting structured water\\n\\nnor that they adhere to the claims\\n\\nthat structured water is going to be really, really good\\n\\nfor them compared to other forms of water.\\n\\nThat said, I do think that there's an interesting\\n\\nand open space for further exploration\\n\\nof the biological effects of structured water,\\n\\ngiven the fact that structured water does exist,\\n\\nI don't think anyone debates that,\\n\\nand the fact that the different structures of water\\n\\nin this fourth phase of water, as we're calling it,\\n\\nhas been shown to interface with solids\\n\\nand other aspects of liquids\\n\\nand can do so within organelles of cells.\\n\\nDifferent components of cells\\n\\nthat control different functions, including mitochondria.\\n\\nI think there's a potential there.\\n\\nWhether or not there's a promise there\\n\\nis another question entirely.\\n\\nI don't want to shut the door on structured water.\\n\\nI think this is an open question\\n\\nthat I hope there will be more data\\n\\nto answer those questions in the not too distant future.\\n\\nMeanwhile, if any of you are aware\\n\\nof good clinical studies\\n\\nexploring the biological effects of structured water\\n\\nin either animal models or humans,\\n\\nplease put those references in the comments on YouTube\\n\\nbecause I'm very curious as to how this area\\n\\nof biological effects of structured water\\n\\nis evolving and continues to evolve.\\n\\nSo today we discussed water.\\n\\nAnd admittedly, we went into a lot of detail\\n\\nabout the physics and chemistry of water\\n\\nin its various forms.\\n\\nAnd we talked about hydration\\n\\nbecause I think that's the main reason\\n\\nwhy many of you are interested in or concerned about water.\\n\\nWe also talked about contaminants in tap water,\\n\\nwhich unfortunately do exist and are very prominent\\n\\nin essentially all regions of the world.\\n\\nSo please do get some information\\n\\nabout what's coming out of your tap.\\n\\nI also want to throw in one other piece of information\\n\\nthat's really critical that I learned about\\n\\nwhen researching this episode,\\n\\nwhich is the quality of water that comes out of your tap\\n\\nis not just dictated by the source that it comes from,\\n\\nexternal to your home or apartment.\\n\\nYour pipes are also important.\\n\\nAnd that filter or that little mesh\\n\\nthat sits at the faucet head is also very important.\\n\\nMost people don't pay attention to that,\\n\\nbut it turns out that a lot of debris and contaminants\\n\\ncan be derived from that little filter\\n\\nthat most people just simply aren't cleaning often enough.\\n\\nSo here, I'm not trying to tell you that the metal\\n\\nor the plastic that that filter is made of is a problem.\\n\\nMore often than not, contaminants are showing up in water\\n\\nbecause people aren't cleaning those filters often enough.\\n\\nAnd in fact, prior to researching this episode,\\n\\nI didn't ever think to clean that filter.\\n\\nI looked underneath my faucet\\n\\nand while that filter didn't look particularly filled\\n\\nwith debris, I did find that when I took it off\\n\\nand I looked at the other side,\\n\\nthere was quite a lot of debris.\\n\\nSo if you are going to consume tap water,\\n\\nyou definitely want to consider the source,\\n\\nthe pipes in your building or apartment,\\n\\nthe ones that lead right up to your glass or jug\\n\\nthat you would put that water into\\n\\nand also that mesh that that water passes through\\n\\nas it goes into that glass or jug.\\n\\nWe also talked about how much water to drink.\\n\\nI hope that we finally resolved that question\\n\\nfor those of you that have been wondering about that.\\n\\nThe Galpin equation is a wonderful approach\\n\\nto how much water to consume during exercise.\\n\\nAnd by providing these other formulas\\n\\nof about eight ounces or 240 milliliters of water per hour\\n\\nfor the 10 hours from waking until post-waking,\\n\\non average, remember it's averages,\\n\\nyou don't have to consume them every hour on the hour\\n\\nand no need to be neurotic.\\n\\nHopefully you can achieve better levels of hydration,\\n\\nwhich we know can lead to reductions in blood pressure,\\n\\nimprovements in appetite, mood and focus.\\n\\nAnd I really think that it's the improvements\\n\\nin cognitive focus and physical ability,\\n\\nboth endurance, strength and other forms of\\n\\nkind of readiness in the body,\\n\\nreadiness to perform work in the body\\n\\nthat really are best supported by the hydration literature.\\n\\nAnd then of course, we went through\\n\\nthe different forms of water that you hear about out there\\n\\nand addressed which ones are going to be beneficial or not.\\n\\nAnd perhaps more importantly,\\n\\nwhy any of them would be beneficial.\\n\\nThinking about that from the perspective of biologists\\n\\nand the chemistry of water.\\n\\nAnd I do hope that by arriving at this point\\n\\nin the episode now that you have a much better understanding\\n\\nof the chemistry and physics of water\\n\\nand the way that water can powerfully impact your biology.\\n\\nIf you're learning from and are enjoying this

       " Document(page_content=\"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\n\\nwhere we discuss science\\n\\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\\n\\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\\n\\nand I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology\\n\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\n\\nToday, we're discussing stimulants,\\n\\nin particular stimulants for the treatment of ADHD,\\n\\nor Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.\\n\\nAs many of you know, there's tremendous interest\\n\\nin drugs like Adderall, Ritalin, Vivance,\\n\\nand other stimulants,\\n\\nas well as non-stimulant prescription drugs\\n\\nthat have been shown to improve the symptoms of ADHD,\\n\\nsuch as modafinil, armodafinil, and guanfacine.\\n\\nToday, I'm going to discuss all of these compounds\\n\\nin the context of how they work\\n\\nto improve the symptoms of ADHD.\\n\\nI'm going to address common questions about these compounds,\\n\\nsuch as, are they just speed?\\n\\nAre they similar to meth or methamphetamine?\\n\\nI'll talk about their addictive potential,\\n\\nas well as their potential to cause psychotic symptoms,\\n\\nboth in the short and long-term.\\n\\nAnd of course, I will talk\\n\\nabout the scientific literature surrounding\\n\\nthe most frequently asked question about these compounds,\\n\\nwhich is, what are the long-term consequences\\n\\nof taking any of them in childhood or in adulthood?\\n\\nNow, today's discussion centers around the use\\n\\nof these compounds, both for childhood and for adult ADHD.\\n\\nBut of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge\\n\\nthat there are a tremendous number of people\\n\\nthat use these prescription drugs without a prescription\\n\\nin order to improve their ability to focus\\n\\nand indeed also use them recreationally.\\n\\nIn fact, some surveys reveal that as high as 80%\\n\\nof college-age young adults have used one\\n\\nor several of prescription drugs,\\n\\nsuch as Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse, or similar,\\n\\nat some point and are doing so without a prescription.\\n\\nSo they are either obtaining those drugs\\n\\nfrom those that do have prescriptions for them, for ADHD,\\n\\nor they are obtaining them through black market sources,\\n\\nwhich of course carries an additional\\n\\nand very serious risk related\\n\\nto the so-called fentanyl crisis,\\n\\nthat is as high as 75% of black market drugs nowadays\\n\\nof various kinds, but certainly including the sorts\\n\\nof drugs we're going to talk\\n\\nabout today are contaminated with fentanyl\\n\\nand therefore are very deadly.\\n\\nSo today I'm going to describe\\n\\nwhat these various drugs really are,\\n\\nhow they work at the level of neurons and brain networks,\\n\\nand how they change those brain networks\\n\\nin ways that really can allow people\\n\\nwith ADHD to be able to focus better.\\n\\nI will answer the common question,\\n\\nwhich is why is it that giving children speed,\\n\\nbecause indeed several, not all,\\n\\nbut several of the compounds I'm going to discuss are speed.\\n\\nThey are amphetamine.\\n\\nWhy would that cause a reduction\\n\\nin hyperactivity if speed is a stimulant?\\n\\nSo I'll answer that question for you.\\n\\nAnd I will also answer questions that are commonly asked,\\n\\nsuch as how these drugs impact things like sleep,\\n\\nhormone health, reproductive health,\\n\\nas well as what is their impact on height?\\n\\nIndeed, it was one prominent hypothesis\\n\\nthat these ADHD meds could actually restrict\\n\\nthe height of children.\\n\\nI'll tell you whether or not that's actually true or not.\\n\\nAnd I'll discuss the data surrounding\\n\\nwhether or not these drugs predispose people\\n\\nto becoming addicts to other substances,\\n\\neven if people cease or continue taking the stimulants\\n\\nthat can help them in the clinical sense for ADHD.\\n\\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast\\n\\nis separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.\\n\\nIt is, however, part of my desire and effort\\n\\nto bring zero cost to consumer information about science\\n\\nand science-related tools to the general public.\\n\\nIn keeping with that theme,\\n\\nI'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.\\n\\nOur first sponsor is Maui Nui Venison.\\n\\nMaui Nui Venison is the most

including myself,\\n\\nare not on the ketogenic diet.\\n\\nThat is, I and most people eat complex carbohydrates,\\n\\nfruits and things of that sort,\\n\\nin addition to quality proteins, et cetera.\\n\\nIt turns out that even if you're not following\\n\\na ketogenic diet, increasing your blood ketones\\n\\ncan still have benefits.\\n\\nSo for instance, I use ketone IQ\\n\\nanytime I want to do extended bouts of focused work,\\n\\npreparing for podcasts, research, writing grants,\\n\\nand if I ever want to exercise,\\n\\nbut I don't have time to eat\\n\\nor I don't want to have my gut

treatments for ADHD\\n\\nand why stimulant treatments in particular\\n\\ncan be so effective.\\n\\nFirst of all, it's long been known\\n\\nthat there are specific brain networks\\n\\ninvolved in what we call attention.\\n\\nNow, attention is not one thing actually.\\n\\nIt involves several different cognitive operations,\\n\\nincluding the suppression of noise,\\n\\nthat is turning down the background chatter in our heads\\n\\nand turning down our attending to things outside us\\n\\nlike noises or visual cues\\n\\nthat are not relevant to what we want to do.\\n\\nAnd it also involves ramping up or attending,\\n\\nwe're focusing on particular things that are happening\\n\\neither in our immediate environment\\n\\nor in our head or both.\\n\\nSo if that all sounds rather complex, indeed it is,\\n\\nit involves several different networks operating in parallel.\\n\\nBut what we know for sure based on a lot of clinical\\n\\nand scientific laboratory data\\n\\nis that the so-called prefrontal cortex,\\n\\nthe region of neural real estate in your brain\\n\\njust behind your forehead is critically important\\n\\nfor orchestrating which neural circuits\\n\\nare going to be more or less active at a given moment\\n\\nin order to bring about what we call focus or attention\\n\\nor task switching or our ability indeed to multitask\\n\\nbecause we can actually multitask to some extent.\\n\\nIn fact, if you were to look at somebody\\n\\nand focus on perhaps the expression on their face,\\n\\nyou could do that while also attending to a conversation\\n\\nthat's happening nearby.\\n\\nIt's energetically demanding, it's hard to do,\\n\\nbut we can do that.\\n\\nThat's actually referred to as covert attention.\\n\\nYou're covertly paying attention to something else.\\n\\nAnd then you can switch that attention\\n\\nback to just one thing or one small collection of things.\\n\\nThe point being that attention is a powerful resource.\\n\\nIt's what allows us to navigate through life with efficiency\\n\\nand to be adaptive in our behaviors.\\n\\nIt's what allows us to learn and to build relationships\\n\\nand have successful school careers\\n\\nand professional careers and so on.\\n\\nBut it is indeed expensive.\\n\\nIt takes metabolic resources.\\n\\nJust at rest, if you were to think about essentially nothing\\n\\nor whatever just pops into your mind\\n\\nwith no dedicated effort toward paying attention\\n\\nto anything, your brain would consume about 25%\\n\\nof your daily caloric needs.\\n\\nAnd then when you lump on top of that,\\n\\nyour need or your attempts to focus on things,\\n\\nto pay attention to specific things,\\n\\nit should come as no surprise\\n\\nas to why that often can make us feel tired\\n\\nas if we've been working really hard\\n\\nand we've been running a quote unquote mental marathon\\n\\nwhen trying to learn and attend to things.\\n\\nIt's hard work for the brain and yet we can pay attention\\n\\nbecause of that very precious real estate\\n\\njust behind our foreheads, the prefrontal cortex.\\n\\nNow in people, both children and adults that have ADHD,\\n\\ntheir prefrontal cortex is not necessarily deficient\\n\\nin any specific way except that it is not as good\\n\\nat orchestrating the activity of other brain networks\\n\\noperating in parallel with it.\\n\\nWhat do I mean by that?\\n\\nWell, if we take a step back and say,\\n\\nwhat is the prefrontal cortex really doing?\\n\\nThe prefrontal cortex has this amazing ability\\n\\nthrough what's called top-down inhibition\\n\\nto quiet other brain areas.\\n\\nSo for instance, if you are feeling agitated\\n\\nbut you need to sit still, your ability to sit still,\\n\\neven if it takes a bit of work,\\n\\nis coordinated by your prefrontal cortex\\n\\nsending inhibitory, suppressive electrical signals\\n\\nto the networks of your brain\\n\\nthat are trying to generate physical action.\\n\\nIn addition to that, if you are in a conversation,\\n\\nthat's either a difficult one or a boring one\\n\\nor you are tempted to interrupt\\n\\nand you are actively holding back your desire to walk away\\n\\nor to yawn or to blurt something out,\\n\\nit's your prefrontal cortex\\n\\nthat is controlling that active suppression.\\n\\nSo in many ways, you can just think\\n\\nof the prefrontal cortex as an orchestra conductor\\n\\nthat is essentially saying shh or not right now, be quiet.\\n\\nThis is not the time\\n\\nto many different brain networks all at once.\\n\\nNow, in addition to that,\\n\\nyour prefrontal cortex is coordinating\\n\\nwith other brain networks that are involved\\n\\nin generating what's called salience\\n\\nor attention to particular signals.\\n\\nSo the prefrontal cortex in many ways is like a teacher\\n\\nor an orchestra conductor.\\n\\nIt can point to, in the neurochemical sense that is,\\n\\npoint to a given brain structure and say,\\n\\nyou, I'd like to hear more from you right now.\\n\\nYes, you, the student in the back, speak up.\\n\\nAnd a moment later, point to a collection\\n\\nof small students chattering in the back.\\n\\nAgain, I'm presenting all this by analogy and say,\\n\\nhey, hey, hey, you guys, quiet down right now.\\n\\nSo-and-so is going to come up to the front of the room\\n\\nand help us work through this particular math problem.\\n\\nSo when we hear that the prefrontal cortex exerts\\n\\nwhat's called executive function,\\n\\nwhat that refers to is the prefrontal cortex's ability\\n\\nto quiet the activity of particular neural circuits\\n\\nand to enhance or increase the salience\\n\\nof other neural circuits that are involved\\n\\nin creating our spotlight of attention.\\n\\nAnd what we know for sure,\\n\\nbased on many, many brain imaging studies,\\n\\nis that ADHD is not necessarily a deficit\\n\\nin prefrontal cortical function,\\n\\nbut rather the prefrontal cortex's ability\\n\\nto communicate with other brain areas in the proper ways.\\n\\nAnd so what results in the brain of a person,\\n\\neither young or old with ADHD,\\n\\nis that a lot of the background chatter\\n\\nbecomes very, very loud.\\n\\nSo for instance, we have a brain network\\n\\ncalled the default mode network.\\n\\nThis is a fascinating brain network.\\n\\nThis is the brain network that is active\\n\\nwhen you just sort of sit in place\\n\\nand don't think about much.\\n\\nAnd then you start having ideas\\n\\nabout what you might do next week.\\n\\nIt tends to be very autobiographical.\\n\\nSo you might remember an experience from the past.\\n\\nYou might think about some of your desires,\\n\\nsome of your dislikes.\\n\\nThis default mode network, as it's called,\\n\\nis also involved in our imagination,\\n\\nin our spooling together\\n\\nof different experiences that we've had.\\n\\nIt doesn't tend to be the thing\\n\\nthat's really focused on anything external,\\n\\nin particular, all at once.\\n\\nThe default mode network is always active,\\n\\nbut it's when we start to attend to something,\\n\\nespecially things external to us,\\n\\nlike something written on a page or a conversation\\n\\nor something that we really need to learn,\\n\\nsomething we need to pay attention to,\\n\\nthat the activity of the default mode network\\n\\nis suppressed somewhat.\\n\\nAnd that suppression occurs not just by accident,\\n\\nbut because the prefrontal cortex is actively suppressing it.\\n\\nIn kids and adults with ADHD,\\n\\nthe default mode network is often still active\\n\\nat a very robust level,\\n\\neven while we're trying to attend to things.\\n\\nAnd that's why someone with ADHD will sit down\\n\\nand try and do some focused work.\\n\\nAnd they'll start thinking about something they want\\n\\nor something they dislike.\\n\\nTheir internal state will start to distract them.\\n\\nAnd of course, there are other networks in the brain.\\n\\nThere's actually what's called a true salience network.\\n\\nThere's the dorsal attention network.\\n\\nThere are a bunch of different networks in brain areas.\\n\\nBut again, when thinking about ADHD,\\n\\nand especially when thinking about how the drugs\\n\\nthat we're going to talk about today\\n\\nwork to alleviate the symptoms of ADHD,\\n\\nand in thinking about why so many people use\\n\\nor even abuse these drugs for sake of learning\\n\\nor recreationally, we might say,\\n\\nyou start to realize that everything centers back\\n\\nto the prefrontal cortex and the prefrontal cortex's ability\\n\\nto actively suppress and actively enhance the activity\\n\\nof these multiple brain networks,\\n\\nincluding default mode network, salience network,\\n\\ndorsal attention network, et cetera.\\n\\nSo rather than overwhelm you with a bunch of names\\n\\nof brain areas and brain networks,\\n\\ntoday I'd really like our discussion\\n\\nto focus on first, what the various drugs\\n\\nthat are used to treat ADHD are,\\n\\nthat is how do they work at the level of neurons?\\n\\nSecond, how they create a certain set of conditions\\n\\nthat allow the prefrontal cortex to be a better conductor.\\n\\nThird, how that can be leveraged during development\\n\\nto actually teach the prefrontal cortex of a young child\\n\\nto learn to be a better conductor,\\n\\nbecause that's really the hallmark of the use\\n\\nof these drugs is to try and enhance the activity\\n\\nof particular circuits to create a sort of learning\\n\\nso that the prefrontal cortex is much more efficient\\n\\nat doing its job of conducting.\\n\\nAnd then fourth, we're going to talk about\\n\\nthe various things that I think most people out there\\n\\nask about when they hear about drugs\\n\\nlike Adderall Vyvanse and Ritalin, et cetera,\\n\\nwhich is, are they addictive?\\n\\nWhy are they addictive?\\n\\nCan one use them briefly or even from time to time\\n\\nand still be okay?\\n\\nWhat if I use them as a child\\n\\nand I don't want to be on them anymore?\\n\\nShould I put my child on these drugs, et cetera?\\n\\nIt is, I believe, only by understanding the biology\\n\\nof how these drugs work and their potential\\n\\nboth to improve brain function,\\n\\nbut also some of the dangers associated with these drugs\\n\\nthat one can really answer those questions\\n\\nfor themselves or for their children.\\n\\nOkay, so let's start with a very basic,\\n\\nbut critical question, which is why in the world\\n\\nwould amphetamines, speed, or other stimulants\\n\\nimprove the symptoms of ADHD?\\n\\nThat's so critical to answer because if you think about it,\\n\\nthe prefrontal cortex needs to coordinate the actions\\n\\nof these other circuits.\\n\\nAnd so just increasing the amount of activity\\n\\nin prefrontal cortex, you can imagine,\\n\\nwould create a state of hyper-focus perhaps,\\n\\nbut actually that's not the case.\\n\\nIf you just were to ramp up the activity\\n\\nof prefrontal cortex, what you would find\\n\\nis that somebody would become even less efficient\\n\\nat paying attention to what they wanted to\\n\\nrather they would pay attention to whatever was presented\\n\\nin front of them with laser focus.\\n\\nThey would lock on to essentially anything\\n\\nand that's not good.\\n\\nOne of the key things about prefrontal cortex\\n\\nis that it needs to be flexible.\\n\\nIt needs to be able to pay attention to this.\\n\\nThen it needs to be able to pay attention to that.\\n\\nThen it needs to go back to paying attention\\n\\nto the thing it was paying attention to previously\\n\\nand so on and so forth.\\n\\nLife that is an effective adaptive life, a good life,\\n\\nconsists of self-directing one's attention\\n\\nmost all of the time.\\n\\nSo why would stimulants do that?\\n\\nWell, almost all, not all,\\n\\nbut almost all of the drugs used to treat ADHD\\n\\nfall under the category of stimulants\\n\\nor what are called sympathomimetics.\\n\\nSympathomimetic refers to the fact\\n\\nthat we naturally have a component of our nervous system\\n\\ncalled the autonomic nervous system.\\n\\nThe autonomic nervous system has two major components.\\n\\nOne is called the sympathetic arm\\n\\nof the autonomic nervous system,\\n\\nhas nothing to do with sympathy,\\n\\nhas everything to do with ramping up\\n\\nour level of attention and arousal.\\n\\nIt is the so-called fight or flight aspect\\n\\nof our nervous system,\\n\\nor rather it mediates fight or flight,\\n\\nbut it mediates a bunch of other things too,\\n\\nincluding sexual arousal,\\n\\nincluding excitement and focus\\n\\nabout something that we want to learn\\n\\nor somebody that we want to learn more about\\n\\nor remembering a phone number\\n\\nor anything that puts us into a state\\n\\nof alertness and focus.\\n\\nThe other arm of the autonomic nervous system\\n\\nis the so-called parasympathetic arm\\n\\nof the autonomic nervous system.\\n\\nAnd that's often referred to as the so-called\\n\\nrest and digest component of our nervous system.\\n\\nAnd yes, it controls rest.\\n\\nIndeed, it puts us into sleep.\\n\\nAnd yes, it's involved in digestion,\\n\\nbut it's involved in a bunch of other things as well,\\n\\nincluding sexual arousal,\\n\\nincluding rates of digestion,\\n\\nincluding salivation,\\n\\nincluding all sorts of things\\n\\nthat don't just have to do with resting and digesting.\\n\\nThe way to think about the autonomic nervous system\\n\\nis it's a sort of seesaw.\\n\\nSo it's always at a balance someplace\\n\\nbetween either predominantly sympathetic\\n\\nor predominantly parasympathetic,\\n\\nbut both the parasympathetic and the sympathetic arms\\n\\nof the autonomic nervous system\\n\\nare always active all the time.\\n\\nIt's not as if one is completely active\\n\\nand the other shut off.\\n\\nEven in sleep, your sympathetic nervous system\\n\\nis not completely turned off.\\n\\nAnd even during a panic attack,\\n\\nyour parasympathetic nervous system\\n\\nis not completely turned off.\\n\\nDrugs to treat ADHD,\\n\\nwhich fall under the category of stimulants,\\n\\nare sympathomimetics\\n\\nbecause they trigger the release of neurochemicals\\n\\nand the activation of components of our nervous system\\n\\nthat very much resemble the activation\\n\\nof the so-called sympathetic nervous system,\\n\\nthe one that makes us more alert and more aroused.\\n\\nSo that's why they're called sympathomimetics.\\n\\nAnd the word stimulant refers to a general category\\n\\nof drugs that are sympathomimetics.\\n\\nNow, the most commonly discussed sympathomimetic\\n\\nis one that fortunately is not prescribed for ADHD,\\n\\nand that's methamphetamine.\\n\\nThese days, we hear a lot about meth.\\n\\nMeth, which is methylated amphetamine,\\n\\nis an extremely potent sympathomimetic,\\n\\nand it has tremendous abuse potential.\\n\\nBecause believe it or not,\\n\\nmeth or methamphetamine is actually available\\n\\nas a prescription drug,\\n\\nbut it is used very rarely\\n\\nbecause of its high abuse potential\\n\\nand all the terrible things that it can do\\n\\nin terms of cardiovascular health,\\n\\nin terms of oral health, right?\\n\\nThere's this stereotype that meth users\\n\\nhave very degraded teeth, and indeed they do.\\n\\nThere's a reason for that\\n\\nrelated to how meth impacts the brain and body.\\n\\nI'm going to talk a little bit about methamphetamine\\n\\na little bit later,\\n\\nbut let's just place methamphetamine high on the shelf\\n\\nas the most potent sympathomimetic that's out there,\\n\\nbecause even though it's not often prescribed for ADHD,\\n\\nthere are a class of compounds very similar to it\\n\\nthat have a very similar pattern of action\\n\\nthat is not quite as potent,\\n\\nbut that leverages the same underlying mechanisms,\\n\\nand they are very commonly prescribed for ADHD,\\n\\nnamely Adderall and Vyvanse.\\n\\nSo first let's talk about Adderall and what Adderall is.\\n\\nAdderall is a combination\\n\\nof what are called amphetamine salts.\\n\\nAmphetamine salts refers to the fact\\n\\nthat there are two major forms of amphetamine.\\n\\nThere's a D-amphetamine or dexoramphetamine\\n\\nand levonphetamine or L-amphetamine.\\n\\nSo I'll refer to these as D and L-amphetamine.\\n\\nAnd for you chemistry-minded folks out there,\\n\\nthe D and the L also refer to the fact\\n\\nthat there's a L left-handed version of the molecule,\\n\\nand there's a D or right-handed version of the molecule.\\n\\nThis is only important to understand\\n\\ninsofar as you know that the D and the L forms\\n\\nof the molecule look very similar,\\n\\nbut they're mirror images of one another,\\n\\nand yet they can have very different actions\\n\\nin the brain and body.\\n\\nSo Adderall is a three-to-one ratio\\n\\nof D-amphetamine to L-amphetamine.\\n\\nYou should know that L-amphetamine\\n\\ntends to be less potent\\n\\nin increasing certain neurochemicals in the brain.\\n\\nI'll talk about which neurochemicals they are in a moment.\\n\\nThen is D-amphetamine.\\n\\nSo D-amphetamine is potent stuff,\\n\\nnot as potent as methamphetamine, but very potent stuff.\\n\\nL-amphetamine, a little bit less potent.\\n\\nL-amphetamine tends to be the amphetamine\\n\\nthat increases blood pressure and heart rate,\\n\\nwhat we call peripheral effects,\\n\\nbecause it happens in the periphery,\\n\\noutside the central nervous system.\\n\\nPeripheral effects like increased heart rate,\\n\\nincreased blood pressure, sweating, et cetera,\\n\\nare mostly activated by L-amphetamine,\\n\\nwhereas D-amphetamine tends to work mainly\\n\\non receptors in the brain,\\n\\nand therefore have effects mainly restricted to the brain.\\n\\nNow, what are these effects that I've been referring to?\\n\\nThe major effect of Adderall\\n\\nand other sympathomimetic stimulants\\n\\nis to increase the activity of two neurochemicals.\\n\\nThe first of those neurochemicals is dopamine,\\n\\nand the other of those neurochemicals is norepinephrine.\\n\\nFirst off, I want to be clear that when I say norepinephrine,\\n\\nI could just as easily say noradrenaline,\\n\\nbecause those are the exact same thing.\\n\\nAnd forgive me, even though I wasn't the one\\n\\nto name the same thing in two different things,\\n\\nI'll try and stay with norepinephrine,\\n\\nbut I may say noradrenaline.\\n\\nThey are the same thing.\\n\\nThere's a whole story as to how they got named\\n\\ntwo different things, but it's the same thing.\\n\\nThe major effect of Adderall\\n\\nand other sympathomimetic stimulants\\n\\nis to increase the transmission\\n\\nof dopamine and norepinephrine.\\n\\nSo what is dopamine and what is norepinephrine?\\n\\nWell, both dopamine and norepinephrine\\n\\nare what are called neuromodulators.\\n\\nThat is, they have the ability to increase or decrease\\n\\nthe firing patterns, the electrical activity\\n\\nof particular brain circuits.\\n\\nBoth dopamine and norepinephrine have separate roles\\n\\nin creating certain states within our brain and body,\\n\\nbut they like to collaborate,\\n\\nmeaning they tend to be released at similar locations\\n\\nin the brain in order to deliver us\\n\\nto a particular state of mind and or body.\\n\\nSo if we were to take a look at just dopamine,\\n\\nwe would find that dopamine is released\\n\\nat sites within the brain\\n\\nand increases the activity of brain networks\\n\\nthat for the most part lead to increases in motivation,\\n\\npursuit, and to some extent mood.\\n\\nIf we were to look at norepinephrine\\n\\nand where it's released in the brain,\\n\\nit tends to be released at many, not all,\\n\\nbut many of the same sites where dopamine is released.\\n\\nAnd the main function of norepinephrine\\n\\nis to increase the activity of neural networks\\n\\nthat are involved in attention and focus\\n\\nto particular things in our environment.\\n\\nOkay, so think of dopamine and norepinephrine\\n\\nas collaborators because indeed they are.\\n\\nAnd actually they're very neurochemically similar as well.\\n\\nIt actually just takes one chemical conversion\\n\\nto turn dopamine into norepinephrine.\\n\\nSo they are very similar.\\n\\nThey're like close cousins that work together\\n\\nto help us achieve a common goal\\n\\nthat involves increased motivation, focus, and alertness.\\n\\nSo when we talk about attention in ADHD\\n\\nor we talk about quieting the hyperactivity\\n\\nor impulsivity of ADHD,\\n\\none of the reasons why drugs that are effective\\n\\nin treating ADHD are so effective\\n\\nis because they increase motivation, focus, and alertness,\\n\\nand they tend to do that\\n\\nat very focal locations in the brain.\\n\\nIt's worth taking a couple of minutes\\n\\nto think about how sympathomimetics such as Adderall\\n\\nactually increase dopamine and norepinephrine.\\n\\nThey do so by affecting a couple of specific operations\\n\\nat the so-called synapse.\\n\\nWhat are synapses?\\n\\nSynapses are the communication points between neurons.\\n\\nThey're actually the spaces between neurons,\\n\\nbut that's where a lot of the action is\\n\\nwhen neurons, as we say, are stimulating the next neuron\\n\\nor activating the next neuron or inhibiting the next neuron.\\n\\nThe word neuron just simply refers to nerve cell.\\n\\nAnd so what nerve cells have is they have a cell body\\n\\nthat contains their DNA and a bunch of other stuff.\\n\\nThey have a long wire-like process,\\n\\nwhich is referred to as an axon.\\n\\nAnd at the end of that axon,\\n\\nthere are a bunch of proteins in there\\n\\nthat do really interesting things.\\n\\nSo for instance, there are proteins down\\n\\nat the end of the axon that package neurotransmitter\\n\\ninto little spherical things that we call vesicles.\\n\\nThose vesicles can fuse with the end of the axon\\n\\nand vomit the contents, those neurotransmitters,\\n\\ninto the synaptic cleft,\\n\\ninto that little space between neurons.\\n\\nAnd then if enough of those neurotransmitters\\n\\nbind to receptors on what's called the postsynaptic side,\\n\\nwhich simply means the neuron on the other side,\\n\\nwell, then the next neuron will become active\\n\\nand then the signal will propagate\\n\\nfrom one neuron to the next.\\n\\nNow, I just described that whole process pretty quickly,\\n\\nand I like to think pretty simply,\\n\\nbut it actually involves a lot of different protein bits\\n\\nand some pretty complex machinery\\n\\nin order to make that happen.\\n\\nI don't want to overcomplicate our conversation,\\n\\nbut what I will tell you is that down in the synapse,\\n\\nin the presynaptic terminal,\\n\\nthe neuron that is going to release neurotransmitter,\\n\\nthere are what are called transporters,\\n\\nwhich sit there and suck up or suck back up\\n\\nsome of the neurotransmitter that's been released.\\n\\nThere are dopamine transporters\\n\\nand there are norepinephrine\\n\\nor noradrenergic transporters down in the synapse.\\n\\nWhat Adderall does and what other sympathomimetics do\\n\\nis to inhibit or disrupt the action of those transporters.\\n\\nAnd the net consequence of that\\n\\nis that when dopamine and norepinephrine\\n\\nare released into the synapse,\\n\\nmore of it is allowed to stick around\\n\\nand to bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell\\n\\nthan would be the case if Adderall or the other stimulant\\n\\nwere not present in the system.\\n\\nSo one way that Adderall increases dopamine\\n\\nand norepinephrine is by disrupting the activity\\n\\nof these presynaptic transporters\\n\\nfor dopamine and norepinephrine.\\n\\nThe other way that Adderall increases dopamine\\n\\nand norepinephrine is that it disrupts the activity\\n\\nof a different piece of machinery\\n\\nin the presynaptic neuron, which is called a VMAT,\\n\\nthe vesicle monoamine transporter II,\\n\\nif you really want to get specific.\\n\\nYou don't have to remember these names,\\n\\nbut what these VMATs do is actually really cool.\\n\\nWhat they do is they actually take whatever transmitter\\n\\nhas been brought back up into the cell by transporters\\n\\nand they package it into those vesicles\\n\\nthat are then going to be released.\\n\\nBy disrupting the transporters that vacuum back up\\n\\nsome of the dopamine or norepinephrine that's been released,\\n\\nand by also disrupting the packaging of dopamine\\n\\nand norepinephrine into vesicles themselves,\\n\\nwhat ends up happening is that there's a buildup\\n\\nof a lot more dopamine and norepinephrine\\n\\nin the presynaptic terminal,\\n\\nso that when an electrical signal travels down the neuron,\\n\\nnow the total amount of dopamine and norepinephrine\\n\\nthat's released is increased, okay?\\n\\nSo what's happening when you take Adderall\\n\\nis that you're getting more out of the dopamine\\n\\nand norepinephrine that you're releasing,\\n\\nand you're releasing more dopamine\\n\\nand norepinephrine altogether.\\n\\nAnd there's a third mechanism by which Adderall increases\\n\\nthe amount of dopamine and norepinephrine present\\n\\nin synapses and therefore can act on other neurons.\\n\\nAnd that has to do with disruption of the entire network\\n\\nbetween these different proteins.\\n\\nI'm not going to go into that in any detail\\n\\nbecause it gets somewhat complicated\\n\\nin terms of the cell biology and some of the biochemistry\\n\\ndown at the tips of these axons,\\n\\nbut suffice to say that Adderall\\n\\nis such an effective sympathomimetic,\\n\\nthat is it can increase dopamine to such a great extent,\\n\\nespecially compared to other treatments for ADHD,\\n\\nbecause of its ability to increase dopamine release\\n\\nand transmission and therefore action,\\n\\nas well as noradrenergic release and transmission\\n\\nand action down there in the synapse.\\n\\nAnd it's worth pointing out that most of the effect\\n\\nof Adderall is an increasing dopamine\\n\\nas opposed to norepinephrine.\\n\\nIt does increase norepinephrine, but its major effects,\\n\\nor we should say the major effects that have made it\\n\\nsuch an attractive drug to so many people,\\n\\nboth for the treatment of ADHD\\n\\nand for people to take recreationally or off prescription,\\n\\nor for sake of studying or work simply\\n\\nbecause they want to focus more and longer,\\n\\nis because of its ability to increase dopamine\\n\\nto such a great extent.\\n\\nI'd like to take a quick break\\n\\nand acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.\\n\\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1,\\n\\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\\n\\nthat covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.\\n\\nI've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,\\n\\nso I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.\\n\\nThe reason I started taking Athletic Greens\\n\\nand the reason I still take Athletic Greens once\\n\\nor usually twice a day is that it gets to be\\n\\nthe probiotics that I need for gut health.\\n\\nOur gut is very important.\\n\\nIt's populated by gut microbiota\\n\\nthat communicate with the brain, the immune system,\\n\\nand basically all the biological systems of our body\\n\\nto strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.\\n\\nAnd those probiotics and Athletic Greens are optimal\\n\\nand vital for microbiotic health.\\n\\nIn addition, Athletic Greens contains\\n\\na number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals\\n\\nthat make sure that all of my foundational\\n\\nnutritional needs are met.\\n\\nAnd it tastes great.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\\n\\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,\\n\\nand they'll give you five free travel packs\\n\\nthat make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens\\n\\nwhile you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.\\n\\nAnd they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.\\n\\nAgain, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman\\n\\nto get the five free travel packs\\n\\nand the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.\\n\\nNow, a bit earlier, I mentioned that L-amphetamine,\\n\\nlevonphetamine is present in Adderall,\\n\\nbut at one quarter the amount of D-amphetamine.\\n\\nOkay, so there's a little bit of L-amphetamine\\n\\nand a lot of D-amphetamine in Adderall.\\n\\nMany of you are probably familiar with Vivance.\\n\\nVivance is a commercial name\\n\\nfor what many people think is extended release Adderall,\\n\\nbut actually Vivance is not extended release Adderall.\\n\\nVivance is a drug in which the pharmaceutical industry\\n\\nhas taken one component of Adderall,\\n\\njust the D-amphetamine component\\n\\nand attached to it an amino acid called lysine.\\n\\nThe amino acid lysine is a big amino acid\\n\\nand the attaching of lysine to D-amphetamine,\\n\\nwhat we call Vivance, makes it what's called a prodrug.\\n\\nIt actually can't have any effect on its own,\\n\\nbut when one takes Vivance and it's broken down in the gut\\n\\nbut to a greater extent actually in the bloodstream,\\n\\nthe lysines are cleaved off slowly over time.\\n\\nAnd as a consequence,\\n\\nVivance is basically timed release D-amphetamine.\\n\\nThis is important because I think a lot of people think\\n\\nthat Adderall, which again is D-amphetamine and L-amphetamine\\n\\nand those two things operate quite a bit differently\\n\\nat the level of norepinephrine and epinephrine\\n\\nand cardiac versus brain effects.\\n\\nA lot of people think Vivance is just slow release Adderall,\\n\\nbut it is not.\\n\\nWhat Vivance is is it's D-amphetamine only,\\n\\nbut in time release form.\\n\\nAnd Vivance was actually developed as a way\\n\\nto try and get around or rather prevent\\n\\nsome of the abuse potential of Adderall\\n\\nand other drugs that contain D-amphetamine.\\n\\nD-amphetamine stands for dextraamphetamine.\\n\\nAnd in the 70s and 80s, there were a fair amount of movies\\n\\nand there was a lot of trafficking\\n\\nand there was a lot of criminal activity\\n\\nrelated to what was called dexedrine.\\n\\nDexedrine is pure D-amphetamine.\\n\\nSo if we're going to be very direct,\\n\\nif I were going to just frame these things\\n\\nin the context of their neurochemistry,\\n\\nwhat I can tell you is that Vivance\\n\\nis time release dexedrine.\\n\\nIt's not time release Adderall.\\n\\nNow, just because there were movies\\n\\nand reports of criminal activity related to dexedrine,\\n\\nthat doesn't necessarily mean that dexedrine\\n\\nis not an effective and useful pharmaceutical.\\n\\nIn fact, Vivance, which is time release dexedrine,\\n\\nhas proved to be very effective in the treatment of ADHD\\n\\nfor a lot of people.\\n\\nAnd the reason for that is this time release\\n\\ndoes indeed prevent abuse in the sense that\\n\\ndespite people's many attempts from what I hear\\n\\nto increase the rate of entry of the D-amphetamine\\n\\ninto their system by either snorting it\\n\\nor God forbid, even injecting it and things of that sort,\\n\\nthe attaching of that lysine to D-amphetamine\\n\\nreally does slow the absorption.\\n\\nSo when somebody takes Vivance,\\n\\nand hopefully people are taking it responsibly,\\n\\nwhen they take Vivance, what they're really getting\\n\\nis a slow trickle of D-amphetamine into their system\\n\\nand therefore a slow, long-lasting increase\\n\\nin dopamine and norepinephrine.\\n\\nAnd indeed, that's what happens.\\n\\nThe effects of Vivance can extend over anywhere\\n\\nfrom 12 to 16, sometimes even 18 hours,\\n\\ndepending on how quickly somebody metabolizes it.\\n\\nAnd I should say that there is no way to predict\\n\\nhow quickly one will metabolize any of these drugs\\n\\nexcept by trying, and that's one of the sort of downsides\\n\\nof the state of things these days.\\n\\nThere's no blood test or enzymatic test\\n\\nthat will tell you whether or not\\n\\nyou're going to be a fast metabolizer or a slow metabolizer.\\n\\nAnd that's why people just have to sort through\\n\\ndifferent dosages, which we'll talk about in a little bit.\\n\\nThey have to sort through\\n\\ndifferent types of sympathomimetics.\\n\\nSome people try Adderall and they find that\\n\\nthe quick time course of Adderall,\\n\\nor at least quick for them, of about six to eight hours\\n\\nis just too fast, and then it wears off\\n\\nand they get into a slump in the afternoon.\\n\\nOther people find that one Adderall taken at 6 a.m.\\n\\nwill have them going all day long and into the night,\\n\\nand it's just too much stimulation,\\n\\nand they need to come way, way down in dose,\\n\\nor they need to think about other sympathomimetics\\n\\nfor ADHD, and we'll talk about\\n\\nwhat some of those other options are in a little bit as well.\\n\\nSo the important thing to understand is that Adderall\\n\\nis really two drugs, DNL-amphetamine,\\n\\nVivance is DM-phetamine, which is also called dexedrine,\\n\\nbut with this time-released aspect\\n\\ncreated by lumping a lysine on there,\\n\\nand you may notice that I haven't mentioned\\n\\none of the major drugs used to treat ADHD,\\n\\nand that's Ritalin, or what's sometimes also called Concerta,\\n\\ndepending on, again, the time-release forms, et cetera.\\n\\nRitalin was very commonly prescribed\\n\\nfor the treatment of ADHD early in the days\\n\\nof using sympathomimetics in order to treat ADHD.\\n\\nSo for instance, I went to college in the early 90s,\\n\\nso I started college in 93, and I graduated in 98.\\n\\nIt was one year in there as a,\\n\\nlet's call it a transition year.\\n\\nI can recall hearing that Ritalin was being prescribed\\n\\nfor ADHD in kids, and I, like many other people,\\n\\nwere wondering what are the long-term consequences\\n\\nof this going to be?\\n\\nI also, like many other people, was very perplexed\\n\\nas to why a stimulant, sympathomimetic, like Ritalin,\\n\\nwas being prescribed for hyperactive kids.\\n\\nThat will become clear in a moment,\\n\\nbut we don't hear so much about Ritalin nowadays,\\n\\nand I think that's because Adderall and Vivance\\n\\nand things like them have become so popular\\n\\nfor the treatment of ADHD.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that Ritalin is not actually amphetamine.\\n\\nRitalin is what's called methylphenidate,\\n\\nand methylphenidate works in a lot of ways\\n\\nthat are similar to the way that Adderall and Vivance work,\\n\\nbut there are certain ways in which it's different.\\n\\nNow, Ritalin, methylphenidate,\\n\\ndoes increase dopamine transmission at synapses,\\n\\nand it does so also by inhibiting the function\\n\\nof that presynaptic dopamine transporter\\n\\nthat would otherwise suck more dopamine back up\\n\\ninto the presynaptic cell.\\n\\nMethylphenidate, Ritalin, also disrupts the activity\\n\\nof the noradrenergic transporter,\\n\\nleading to net increases in the amount\\n\\nof norepinephrine at the synapse,\\n\\nbut it is not as much a potent inhibitor\\n\\nof the noradrenergic transporter,\\n\\nand therefore most of the effect of methylphenidate\\n\\nis to increase dopamine at synapses.\\n\\nA lot of people don't realize this.\\n\\nA lot of people think that Ritalin\\n\\nis just very short-acting Adderall, and that's not the case.\\n\\nIt is true that Ritalin, at least in its standard form,\\n\\ntends to have a pretty short half-life,\\n\\nand therefore its effects basically kick in\\n\\nabout 20 to 40 minutes after taking it,\\n\\nsometimes a little bit sooner, sometimes a little later,\\n\\nand they last about four to six hours,\\n\\nas opposed to the six to eight hours typical of Adderall.\\n\\nBut Ritalin is not short-acting Adderall.\\n\\nRitalin is mainly increasing dopamine\\n\\nand to some extent norepinephrine at synapses,\\n\\nwhereas Adderall and Vivance are increasing\\n\\nboth dopamine and norepinephrine to a much greater extent.\\n\\nAnd for those of you that are interested\\n\\nin the underlying cell biological reason for that,\\n\\nit has something to do with Ritalin's relatively lower\\n\\naffinity for the neuroadrenergic transporter,\\n\\nbut it's also because, remember,\\n\\nI listed off three mechanisms by which Adderall,\\n\\nand by extension, Vivance,\\n\\nincreased dopamine and norepinephrine transmission rate,\\n\\ndisruption of the transporter, disruption of the VMAT2,\\n\\nas well as a disruption of the whole kind of complex\\n\\nof communication between those proteins.\\n\\nWell, Ritalin is really only tapping into\\n\\nthe drug's ability to disrupt the dopamine\\n\\nand neuroadrenergic transporter.\\n\\nSo it's three mechanisms of increasing dopamine\\n\\nand norepinephrine for Adderall and Vivance,\\n\\nand by extension, Dexedrine,\\n\\nand it's only one mechanism for Ritalin\\n\\nto increase dopamine and norepinephrine,\\n\\nand therein, mostly dopamine.\\n\\nSo if we take a step back for a moment\\n\\nfrom all these drugs and all this cell biology\\n\\nof neurons and so forth,\\n\\nand we go back to the brain networks\\n\\ninvolved in attention,\\n\\nremember the orchestra model or the teacher model\\n\\nwhere the prefrontal cortex really sits in top seat\\n\\nin terms of coordinating the actions,\\n\\nboth the shh, the quieting, and the yes, please speak\\n\\nactions of the brain,\\n\\nreally bringing about what we think of\\n\\nas focused attention and task switching,\\n\\nall the stuff that goes along with learning\\n\\nand focus and cognition.\\n\\nWell, what we know is that dopamine and norepinephrine,\\n\\nwhich are differentially increased\\n\\nby these different drugs that we've been talking about,\\n\\nalso differentially impact the various aspects\\n\\nof executive function of the prefrontal cortex,\\n\\nincreasing our attention for specific things.\\n\\nAnd while there is a lot of nuance\\n\\nin the literature about this,\\n\\nwe can safely say a couple of things.\\n\\nFirst of all, increasing dopamine at particular synapses\\n\\nand networks in the brain\\n\\ncan serve as what's called noise reduction.\\n\\nIt can help further enhance the quieting\\n\\nof all that background stuff.\\n\\nThat background stuff can be attention to things\\n\\nin your environment like noises or visual cues.\\n\\nIt could be some internal narrative\\n\\nthat you had about yesterday\\n\\nor something that somebody said about you\\n\\nor something that somebody you like,\\n\\nwould like to say about you\\n\\nor whatever it may be that's happening in your head\\n\\nthat's distracting you,\\n\\nas well as your representation\\n\\nof your internal bodily state, what we call interoception.\\n\\nThis is a really important aspect of attention\\n\\nthat we don't often hear about,\\n\\nwhich is that we have the ability\\n\\nto attend to things outside of us,\\n\\nwhich is called exteroception,\\n\\nas well as an ability to attend to things inside of us,\\n\\nwhich include things like thoughts,\\n\\nbut also includes, for instance,\\n\\nhow empty or full our gut feels,\\n\\nwhether or not we're comfortable in our chair.\\n\\nAnd when we think about the practice of focus and learning\\n\\nor focusing as a verb,\\n\\nit involves often forcing ourselves to sit still.\\n\\nIt often involves us suppressing the fact\\n\\nthat our foot is a little bit cramped\\n\\nor that we might need to use the restroom for,\\n\\nwe might want to delay that for 10, 15 minutes,\\n\\neven though it might be fairly urgent.\\n\\nAll these sorts of things are central\\n\\nto our ability to attend and focus.\\n\\nAnd so dopamine,\\n\\nwhile it does many different things in the brain,\\n\\nmany, many different things,\\n\\none of its main functions in the context\\n\\nof all this prefrontal cortex and attention stuff\\n\\nis to quiet the amount of noise.\\n\\nThat is, it helps the prefrontal cortex\\n\\nsuppress the signals that would otherwise distract us\\n\\ninto thinking about,\\n\\noh yeah, I'm kind of thirsty right now,\\n\\nor I need to use the restroom,\\n\\nor I really want to make this call,\\n\\nor I really want to pick up my phone.\\n\\nAll of that stuff, all of that suppression,\\n\\nthat shh, that quieting down\\n\\nof all the background chatter related to things,\\n\\nexternal and internal to us in our head and our body,\\n\\nis greatly facilitated\\n\\nby having more dopamine present in the synapses\\n\\nthat allow for what we call noise reduction.\\n\\nNow in parallel to that is norepinephrine.\\n\\nNorepinephrine is released from multiple sites\\n\\nin the brain and body,\\n\\nbut within the brain,\\n\\nthere's one major site of neurons\\n\\nthat manufacture norepinephrine.\\n\\nAnd the name of that site is Locus ceruleus.\\n\\nIt sits in the back of the brain.\\n\\nIt's actually a relatively small collection of neurons,\\n\\nbut they are very, very powerful.\\n\\nThey extend their little axons, their wires,\\n\\nto multiple locations in the brain.\\n\\nAnd they release norepinephrine at those locations.\\n\\nSo think of them sort of as a sprinkler system\\n\\nthat originates from one very focal location,\\n\\nbut that can sprinkle norepinephrine\\n\\nat multiple locations in the brain.\\n\\nAnd the amazing thing about Locus ceruleus\\n\\nand that sprinkler system\\n\\nis that indeed the sprinkler system\\n\\ncan be pretty widespread\\n\\nwhere everywhere there's a sprinkler head,\\n\\nsomebody's getting norepinephrine,\\n\\nbut it also can fairly focally release norepinephrine\\n\\nat particular sites.\\n\\nSo while in the context of today's discussion,\\n\\ndopamine is acting largely to impart noise reduction.\\n\\nNorepinephrine has the ability to boost signals at synapses,\\n\\nto increase the amplitude\\n\\nand frequency of communication between neurons.\\n\\nAnd in that way, in the context of today's discussion,\\n\\nnorepinephrine, when released at the particular synapses\\n\\nin the particular brain networks\\n\\nthat are related to attention and learning,\\n\\nis largely serving to increase signal.\\n\\nSo what we have in the context of a drug\\n\\nlike Adderall or Vivance,\\n\\nor to some extent, methylphenidate,\\n\\nRitalin does this as well,\\n\\nis an increase in dopamine and norepinephrine\\n\\nthat is leading to two things,\\n\\nboth a reduction in noise,\\n\\na quieting of the circuitry\\n\\nthat we don't want to hear so much from,\\n\\nand an increase in the signal of the networks\\n\\nthat we do want to pay attention to.\\n\\nAnd the net effect of that noise reduction\\n\\nand signal amplification\\n\\nis what the engineers refer to as increased signal to noise.\\n\\nAnd the consequence of that\\n\\nis a heightened subjective sense or ability\\n\\nto decide what we want to focus on,\\n\\nsit down or stand there and just focus on it.\\n\\nSo the way that we've been discussing drugs to treat ADHD\\n\\nand their ability to increase dopamine and norepinephrine\\n\\nand thereby to reduce the amount of noise,\\n\\nso to speak, in the brain,\\n\\nand to increase the amount of signal\\n\\nrelated to things that we want to attend to,\\n\\nall presumes that the amount of dopamine\\n\\nand the amount of norepinephrine that's being increased\\n\\nis perfect for what we want to accomplish,\\n\\nwhich is increased focus\\n\\nand reduced hyperactivity and impulsivity.\\n\\nBut of course, in the real world,\\n\\nthat's not always the case,\\n\\ndepending on the dosage of the drug,\\n\\none sensitivity to the drug,\\n\\neven what stage of development across the lifespan\\n\\na person is at,\\n\\nthings can really go haywire pretty fast.\\n\\nAnd what I'm referring to when I say haywire\\n\\nis if you think about dopamine\\n\\nand its ability to reduce noise,\\n\\nwell, dopamine does a bunch of other things as well.\\n\\nAnd in fact, we know that if dopamine is increased too much\\n\\nin the brain of somebody that has ADHD\\n\\nor somebody that doesn't have ADHD,\\n\\npeople can become euphoric, people can become manic,\\n\\npeople can even become psychotic.\\n\\nLikewise, if norepinephrine is increased too much,\\n\\npeople won't just become alert,\\n\\nthey will become very anxious, have panic attacks.\\n\\nAnd depending on the drug they're taking,\\n\\nthey may even experience very serious peripheral symptoms,\\n\\nmeaning elevated heart rate and sweating\\n\\nthat is super uncomfortable and on and on.\\n\\nSo everything I've been discussing up until now is true,\\n\\nbut I want to make it clear that it's true in the context\\n\\nof appropriately dosed prescribed drug\\n\\nfor a given condition,\\n\\nwhich leads us to the next question,\\n\\nwhich is why would it be that giving these drugs,\\n\\nwhich are in fact stimulants,\\n\\nwhy would that calm a kid down?\\n\\nWhy would that calm an adult with ADHD down?\\n\\nAnd the answer to that is not completely straightforward.\\n\\nAnd it is worth pointing out that not everyone with ADHD\\n\\nhas impulsivity and hyperactivity\\n\\nand therefore an inability to focus.\\n\\nSome kids and adults with ADHD do have challenges\\n\\nwith impulsivity and hyperactivity, some do not.\\n\\nSome just have challenges with focus.\\n\\nAnd I did an entire episode about ADHD\\n\\nand we are going to have an expert guest on this podcast\\n\\nwho specializes in the treatment of ADHD\\n\\nto talk about some of these issues further.\\n\\nBut I just want to remind everybody\\n\\nthat as in the general population,\\n\\nchildren and adults with ADHD are capable\\n\\nof very concentrated periods of focus.\\n\\nThe pattern, however, tends to be that children\\n\\nand adults with ADHD have a harder time getting\\n\\ninto that state of focus.\\n\\nAnd perhaps most importantly,\\n\\nthey have a very hard time getting into a forced state\\n\\nof focus for things that they don't enjoy doing.\\n\\nI'm sure many of you are also thinking,\\n\\nwait, I don't like to do certain things\\n\\nand it's harder to focus on those things\\n\\nthan on the things I like.\\n\\nOf course, does that mean I have ADHD?\\n\\nAnd the answer is not necessarily so.\\n\\nKids and adults with ADHD exhibit an extreme variation\\n\\nin their ability to focus such that if there's something\\n\\nthey really, really like doing, they can indeed focus.\\n\\nHowever, for many, many other activities\\n\\nthat are required in order to develop,\\n\\nI guess we'll just call it normal life advancement.\\n\\nSo sitting still, listening to conversations\\n\\nthat we may or may not be particularly interested in,\\n\\nthat's where the challenge has come about.\\n\\nSo the point is that these brain networks\\n\\nand these neuromodulators like dopamine and norepinephrine\\n\\nthat we've been talking about\\n\\nin fairly straightforward terms as it relates\\n\\nto a drug's ability to increase their transmission\\n\\nand therefore an improved ability to focus,\\n\\npresumes two things.\\n\\nIt presumes that the dosing is right.\\n\\nThat is that the levels of increases\\n\\nin these neuromodulators is just right.\\n\\nAnd I also just want to acknowledge that ADHD is,\\n\\nfirst of all, not an inability to focus at all.\\n\\nIt is immense challenges in focusing\\n\\non lots of different things as required\\n\\nfor normal life progression.\\n\\nAnd it's also the case that there is no one specific pattern\\n\\nof ADHD that applies to everyone with ADHD.\\n\\nSome people, both kids and adults,\\n\\nwill exhibit the hyperactivity, but not the impulsivity,\\n\\nalthough those two things tend to go hand in hand.\\n\\nSome people will have a challenge in focus\\n\\nwithout hyperactivity, impulsivity, and so forth.\\n\\nAnd all of this just really speaks\\n\\nto the complexity of ADHD.\\n\\nAnd yet, and yet, we can confidently say\\n\\nthat there are more drugs to treat ADHD\\n\\nthan any other psychiatric condition.\\n\\nWe've talked about a few of those now,\\n\\nbut among those, Adderall, Vivance, Ritalin,\\n\\nalso called methylphenidate,\\n\\nthere are time-release versions.\\n\\nThere are different variations\\n\\non those time-release versions.\\n\\nThere's even straight dexedrine,\\n\\nwhich is prescribed for ADHD in some cases, and on and on.\\n\\nAnd you might also find it interesting to know\\n\\nthat that very large kit of drugs, all of which,\\n\\nat least the ones we've talked about so far,\\n\\nare sympathomimetics, are stimulants,\\n\\nare more effective at treating ADHD\\n\\nthan are any other collection of drugs\\n\\nfor treating other psychiatric disorders.\\n\\nSo what all of that diversity of symptomology in ADHD,\\n\\nas well as differences in sensitivity to drugs\\n\\nand individual variation, what all of that speaks to\\n\\nis that the large kit of drugs that's out there\\n\\nis designed to be assessed with the careful consult\\n\\nof a very qualified psychiatrist\\n\\nin order to allow the child or adult\\n\\nto arrive at the specific drug and the specific dosage\\n\\nthat's ideal for their particular pattern of ADHD.\\n\\nAnd that issue actually gives rise to the answer\\n\\nto that now somewhat age-old question\\n\\nas to why giving stimulants to a kid that is hyperactive\\n\\nwould calm them down.\\n\\nAnd the answer is that the hyperactivity, impulsivity,\\n\\nand focus issues present in ADHD in children and adults\\n\\nare the consequence not necessarily\\n\\nof deficient activity of neural circuits\\n\\nin the prefrontal cortex,\\n\\nor deficient activity of the default mode network,\\n\\nor deficient activity of the salience network, et cetera.\\n\\nWhat appears to be the case\\n\\nbased on a lot of high quality neuroimaging data\\n\\nis that the brains of children and adults with ADHD\\n\\nhave all of these networks functioning,\\n\\nbut those networks are actually hyper-connected.\\n\\nThat is, they tend to be co-active\\n\\nat times when ordinarily,\\n\\nmeaning in kids and adults without ADHD,\\n\\nthey would not be co-active.\\n\\nSo that's an important point\\n\\nbecause it's easy to get the impression\\n\\nthat ADHD is just a deficiency in dopamine and norepinephrine,\\n\\nand that's simply not the case.\\n\\nIf you recall, dopamine and norepinephrine\\n\\nare neuromodulators.\\n\\nThey modulate the activity of other neural circuits,\\n\\nand they can both increase and decrease activity\\n\\nwithin those circuits.\\n\\nSo you don't necessarily want to think about dopamine\\n\\nand norepinephrine just as molecules\\n\\nthat increase neural activity.\\n\\nAnd you certainly don't want to think about ADHD\\n\\nas just a deficiency in dopamine\\n\\nor a deficiency in norepinephrine.\\n\\nThe way these drugs work\\n\\nwhen they are used effectively to treat ADHD\\n\\nis to tune the amount of dopamine and norepinephrine\\n\\nthat are present in particular brain networks\\n\\nin order to allow the person to arrive\\n\\nat just the right balance between the activation\\n\\nof these different neural circuits,\\n\\ncausing them largely to be less synchronous in their firing.\\n\\nSo this takes us back to this question\\n\\nof why giving stimulants to a kid would calm them down.\\n\\nIt's not so much that you're giving a stimulant to a kid\\n\\nto place them into a state of calm.\\n\\nI think that's a common misconception.\\n\\nRather, by increasing dopamine and norepinephrine,\\n\\nthese drugs, yes, increase levels\\n\\nof overall autonomic arousal.\\n\\nThey are, after all, sympathomimetics.\\n\\nBut more importantly to the treatment of ADHD symptoms,\\n\\nyou are activating the prefrontal cortex\\n\\nin a way that allows it to be more of a coordinator\\n\\nof that orchestra conductor,\\n\\nor if you prefer the analogy to a teacher in the classroom,\\n\\nto ramp up the activity of certain neural circuits\\n\\nin a given moment and quiet down the activity\\n\\nof other neural circuits,\\n\\nsuch that the default mode network\\n\\ncan still perform its incredible actions.\\n\\nAfter all, the default mode network is involved,\\n\\nnot just in self-referencing and kind of daydreaming,\\n\\nbut also creativity and imagination.\\n\\nThat's been well-described in the literature,\\n\\nas well as the salience network and these other networks\\n\\nthat are designed to drop us\\n\\ninto very narrow trenches of attention.\\n\\nThese drugs for the treatment of ADHD are indeed stimulants,\\n\\nbut the goal of prescribing these drugs to a child\\n\\nor adult with ADHD is to adjust dosage, timing,\\n\\nand the duration over which somebody takes it\\n\\nin their lifespan in order to allow those neural circuits\\n\\nto work in the proper way,\\n\\nmeaning for the conductor to activate the instruments\\n\\nin that little symphony or band in the appropriate order\\n\\nin order to arrive at the right music\\n\\nas opposed to all the instruments playing at once,\\n\\nwhich would just be complete noise.\\n\\nOr again, if you prefer the classroom teaching analogy\\n\\nfor the teacher to call on one student\\n\\nwhile the others are quiet,\\n\\nand then to call on a different student,\\n\\nhave one student return to their seats\\n\\nto have the students work in small groups.\\n\\nAgain, all of this by analogy,\\n\\nthe point being that dopamine and norepinephrine\\n\\nare all allowing these networks to be activated\\n\\nto the precisely correct levels\\n\\nand in the precisely correct sequence.\\n\\nNow, the other key aspect of drugs like Adderall,\\n\\nVyvanse, Ritalin, and similar to treat ADHD\\n\\nhas everything to do with these neuromodulators,\\n\\ndopamine and norepinephrine,\\n\\nbut it has to do with their other incredible feature\\n\\nbesides just their ability to reduce noise\\n\\nand increase signal within these brain networks.\\n\\nAnd that incredibly important feature\\n\\nis what we call neuroplasticity\\n\\nor the brain and nervous system's ability to change\\n\\nin response to experience.\\n\\nI've done entire episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast\\n\\non neuroplasticity, what it is and how to access it\\n\\nat different stages of development and in adulthood.\\n\\nBy the way, you can find those episodes at hubermanlab.com\\n\\nby simply searching plasticity in the search function.\\n\\nBut the important thing to understand about plasticity\\n\\nin the context of today's discussion\\n\\nis that while there are many different ways\\n\\nto induce neuroplasticity, almost all of them,\\n\\ninvolve strongly activating certain brain networks.\\n\\nAnd in that case, also strong or elevated release\\n\\nof certain neuromodulators.\\n\\nNow we've talked about dopamine and norepinephrine.\\n\\nThey are but two of many neuromodulators.\\n\\nOthers include serotonin, acetylcholine,\\n\\nand each of the neuromodulators does different things\\n\\nat different synapses in the brain.\\n\\nAnd there's some global statements\\n\\nthat can be made about each of them.\\n\\nWe've made some of those earlier,\\n\\nlike dopamine is broadly involved\\n\\nin motivation, craving, and pursuit,\\n\\nand norepinephrine in signal detection\\n\\nand drawing a focus or salience\\n\\nto something in our environment\\n\\nor in our body or inner experience.\\n\\nSerotonin does other things,\\n\\nacetylcholine does other things.\\n\\nBut what's really important to understand\\n\\nis that any time there is a dramatic elevation\\n\\nin dopamine and norepinephrine relative to baseline,\\n\\nrelative to what was happening\\n\\nwith dopamine and norepinephrine just prior to that,\\n\\nthat has a tendency to promote neuroplasticity\\n\\nat particular synapses.\\n\\nSo here is where it's appropriate to remind everybody\\n\\nthat neuromodulators are different than neurotransmitters.\\n\\nNeurotransmitters are chemicals\\n\\nthat just like dopamine and norepinephrine\\n\\nare released between neurons,\\n\\nand they are what actually contribute\\n\\nto the electrical signals going up or down\\n\\nbetween different neurons.\\n\\nAnd again, dopamine and norepinephrine\\n\\nmodulate that activity,\\n\\ncausing a given amount of neurotransmitter\\n\\nto have an even greater effect, for instance.\\n\\nSo when we hear about dopamine and norepinephrine\\n\\nand we hear about motivation or focus, et cetera,\\n\\nthat's all fine and good.\\n\\nBut it's also important to remember\\n\\nthat when dopamine and norepinephrine are increased,\\n\\nthere is a higher probability of strengthening connections\\n\\nwhere dopamine and norepinephrine are increased.\\n\\nAnd what that means is that later,\\n\\neven if levels of dopamine and norepinephrine\\n\\nare not increased, if they go back to baseline,\\n\\nit's often the case that if in our prior history\\n\\nor the history of a given set of neurons in our brain,\\n\\nthere was more dopamine or norepinephrine around,\\n\\nit's very likely that the connections\\n\\nwhere that took place are strengthened\\n\\nand therefore more easily activated.\\n\\nAnd this takes us back to the really original purpose\\n\\nof prescribing these sympathomimetic stimulants\\n\\nto children with ADHD during development.\\n\\nIt was, yes, designed to try and help them focus,\\n\\nto reduce their hyperactivity and help them focus.\\n\\nBut it was also designed to help the brain networks\\n\\nthat are responsible for focus to undergo neuroplasticity,\\n\\nthat is for the synapses involved to strengthen\\n\\nso that those networks could function more efficiently\\n\\nlater on, even after cessation of the drug.\\n\\nThis is an absolutely crucial point\\n\\nthat I think is not often discussed when people,\\n\\nfor instance, say, should I put my kid on ADHD meds?\\n\\nOr should I take my kid off of ADHD meds\\n\\nas they transition from adolescence\\n\\nto their later teen years and into college?\\n\\nI mean, after all, no child or parent,\\n\\nor adult for that matter, wants to achieve a bunch\\n\\nof benefits with a drug and then lose those benefits later.\\n\\nNor does any parent or child want to take a drug\\n\\nthat they don't need to take\\n\\nwhen they could access other routes\\n\\nto improving the neural circuitry\\n\\nor the function of some health system in the body.\\n\\nBecause I don't think anyone really wants\\n\\nto medicate their kids unless they have to,\\n\\nI would hope not.\\n\\nAnd I don't think any kid wants to be medicated\\n\\nunless they absolutely need to be medicated.\\n\\nSo increasing dopamine and norepinephrine with these drugs\\n\\nlike Adderall, Vivance, Ritalin, and similar\\n\\nis causing several things.\\n\\nAnd some of those things actually provide\\n\\nsome general answers as to whether or not parents\\n\\nshould put their kids on these compounds in the first place.\\n\\nObviously, they're going to do that\\n\\nunder the careful consult of a qualified psychiatrist,\\n\\nI would hope, and only under those circumstances.\\n\\nBut also whether or not the child\\n\\nshould stay on those drugs over time.\\n\\nAnd here's what we do know for sure.\\n\\nI did a vast search within the literature\\n\\nin order to arrive at what is very clear,\\n\\nwhich is that children with ADHD,\\n\\ntrue ADHD, who are diagnosed with ADHD\\n\\nand are treated with appropriate doses\\n\\nof drugs like Adderall, Ritalin, or Vivance\\n\\nfare far better both in childhood and later in life\\n\\nwhen it comes to performance in school,\\n\\nperformance in terms of focusing on anything,\\n\\nand in terms of general outcomes.\\n\\nSo for instance, a lot of people have wondered\\n\\nand worried about whether or not treatment\\n\\nwith these drugs early in life will set up\\n\\na predisposition for illicit drug abuse\\n\\nor craving and addictive potential later.\\n\\nAnd it is very clear from the studies that have emerged\\n\\nover the last really 15 years,\\n\\nbut mainly within the last five years,\\n\\nbecause that's when most of the data have arrived,\\n\\nthat children with ADHD who are not treated correctly,\\n\\nboth with drugs and behavioral treatments,\\n\\nbecause really the combination of drugs\\n\\nand behavioral treatments is the optimal situation.\\n\\nSo kids with ADHD who are not treated with drugs\\n\\nand behavioral treatments to deal with their ADHD\\n\\nhave a much higher tendency towards illicit drug use\\n\\nand addictive drug potential in their adulthood, okay?\\n\\nSo there is a real danger\\n\\nto not treating ADHD during childhood.\\n\\nAnd the reverse is also true,\\n\\nwhich is that children with ADHD\\n\\nwho take prescription drugs that are sympathomimetics,\\n\\nso yes, as you've heard, they are speed.\\n\\nAmphetamine is speed.\\n\\nAlthough I should say if they take methylphenidate,\\n\\nRitalin or Concerta or something of that sort,\\n\\nthat's not amphetamine.\\n\\nNonetheless, it's a stimulant.\\n\\nIt's a sympathomimetic also.\\n\\nThese are kids that are taking these drugs\\n\\nduring development and therefore levels of dopamine,\\n\\nlevels of norepinephrine are being increased\\n\\nin their brain and body.\\n\\nAnd you might say, well,\\n\\nwouldn't that lead to a craving\\n\\nfor these things later in life?\\n\\nAnd that does not appear to be the case.\\n\\nIn fact, there's some very nice neuroimaging studies,\\n\\nmainly positron emission tomography studies\\n\\nthat I'll provide a link to in the show note captions\\n\\nthat show the early treatment with these drugs\\n\\nactually leads to combinations\\n\\nof increased dopamine transmission\\n\\nin the forebrain later in life\\n\\nat a lower level or a lower threshold, I should say,\\n\\nin a way that essentially says there's normalization\\n\\nof the circuits across time\\n\\nby the application of these drugs early in life.\\n\\nAgain, in the case of children that have diagnosed ADHD,\\n\\nI in no way, shape or form want to imply\\n\\nthat all children should be treated with these drugs.\\n\\nIt's quite clearly not going to be a good idea.\\n\\nSo all of this really speaks to the critical importance\\n\\nof getting an accurate diagnosis of ADHD.\\n\\nDiagnostic criteria include many things in children.\\n\\nThere are multiple,\\n\\nthere are more than nine diagnostic criteria\\n\\nfor each of the categories relating to impulsivity,\\n\\nhyperactivity, and so on.\\n\\nSo a well-qualified psychiatrist will do several things.\\n\\nThey will, first of all,\\n\\ndo a careful diagnostic evaluation of a child.\\n\\nAnd in addition, one would hope that they would think\\n\\nabout prescribing both appropriate pharmacologic treatments\\n\\nfor ADHD, but also be aware of\\n\\nand prescribe the various other types of prescriptions,\\n\\nmeaning behavioral prescriptions.\\n\\nSo there are clearly certain learning tools\\n\\nand things that kids can do\\n\\nin order to improve their ability to focus\\n\\nand to be less impulsive that combine especially well\\n\\nwith drug treatments,\\n\\nas well as new advancements in the realm of nutrition\\n\\nand supplementation that are constantly coming online.\\n\\nAnd the best psychiatrists are going to be tuned\\n\\ninto all of those aspects of treatment for ADHD,\\n\\nnot just prescription drugs, but also behavioral treatments,\\n\\nalso nutritional guidelines, also supplementation,\\n\\nand also updating each and all of those things\\n\\nas a child matures from each stage\\n\\nof development to the next.\\n\\nI'd like to take a quick break\\n\\nand thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.\\n\\nInsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform\\n\\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\\n\\nto help you better understand your body\\n\\nand help you reach your health goals.\\n\\nI've long been a believer\\n\\nin getting regular blood work done for the simple reason\\n\\nthat many of the factors that impact your immediate\\n\\nand long-term health can only be assessed\\n\\nwith a quality blood test.\\n\\nThe problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,\\n\\nhowever, is that they'll give you information\\n\\nabout certain lipid markers or hormone markers,\\n\\nbut no information about what to do with all of that data.\\n\\nInsideTracker makes it very easy to look at your levels\\n\\nof hormones, metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,\\n\\nand then to assess what sorts of behavioral,\\n\\nnutritional, supplementation,\\n\\nor perhaps other interventions you might want to use\\n\\nin order to bring those numbers into the ranges\\n\\nthat are optimal for your health.\\n\\nInsideTracker's ultimate plan now includes\\n\\nthree new hormone markers that are critical to measure\\n\\nduring a woman's reproductive and menopausal years.\\n\\nThese are estradiol, progesterone,\\n\\nand thyroid stimulating hormone.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\\n\\nyou can go

is\\n\\nif a child has been treated with these ADHD meds\\n\\nduring development,\\n\\ndo they need to continue on those drugs indefinitely?\\n\\nAnd the short answer to this is it depends,\\n\\nand that can be a somewhat frustrating answer, I realize,\\n\\nbut the good news is it's something that can be assessed\\n\\nin a fairly straightforward way.\\n\\nLet's recall that the use of these drugs to treat ADHD\\n\\nis designed to accomplish two things.\\n\\nIt's designed to improve the function\\n\\nof those neural circuits that allow a child to focus,\\n\\nand it's also designed to increase the strength\\n\\nof those circuits to effectively teach the circuits\\n\\nhow to learn what focus is.\\n\\nIn other words, these drugs are designed in some cases\\n\\nto be used and then withdrawn later\\n\\nbecause the circuits that they helped build up\\n\\nare functioning well.\\n\\nIn some cases, however, the circuits that underlie focus\\n\\nare not going to be able to function\\n\\nat the level required for normal healthy life progression\\n\\nunless there's continued application of the drug.\\n\\nSo how would this work in the real world context?\\n\\nWell, I think any child or adolescent\\n\\nor person younger than 25 that's taken these drugs\\n\\nhas no doubt achieved some level of neuroplasticity\\n\\nof the neural circuits related\\n\\nto all the things we call focus, and I want to be very clear.\\n\\nThere's no single brain area or set of brain circuits\\n\\nfor what I'm referring to as focus,\\n\\nbecause after all, focus involves task switching,\\n\\nfocus involves all sorts of different cognitive operations\\n\\ndepending on what we're focusing on, right?\\n\\nThe focusing on a sport is basically a practice\\n\\nof directing one's attention in different locations\\n\\nat different moments.\\n\\nFocusing on studying is an entirely different pattern\\n\\nof focus altogether, but the point being,\\n\\nif a person 25 years or younger takes a drug\\n\\nthat increases dopamine and norepinephrine\\n\\nand assuming that things are working,\\n\\nmeaning the dose is right,\\n\\nthey're achieving better ability to focus, et cetera,\\n\\nthose circuits are going to get stronger,\\n\\nand it seems entirely reasonable.\\n\\nIn fact, it was supported by the psychiatrist\\n\\nthat I spoke to prior to this episode\\n\\nthat people who have been on ADHD meds\\n\\nfor any point of time prior to 25\\n\\ntalk to their psychiatrist\\n\\nabout what tapering off those drugs\\n\\nin order to examine whether or not\\n\\nthey still need those drugs would look like.\\n\\nNow, I mentioned the word taper\\n\\nbecause there is a withdrawal potential\\n\\nof simply stopping these drugs very quickly\\n\\nbecause they do ramp up dopamine and norepinephrine.\\n\\nEven though they increase plasticity of the neural circuits\\n\\nfor focus and mood and motivation,\\n\\nif one very abruptly ceases taking any of these drugs,\\n\\nit does not feel good.\\n\\nThat drop in dopamine\\n\\nthat one inevitably experiences\\n\\nis almost always associated with lethargy,\\n\\nwith depressed mood,\\n\\nwith feeling not good in a number of ways,\\n\\nand of course, challenges in focus.\\n\\nSo anytime one is going to go off one of these drugs\\n\\nor sample what it is to even reduce dosage,\\n\\nthat has to be done in close communication\\n\\nwith a board-certified psychiatrist.\\n\\nAt the same time, it was made very clear to me\\n\\nfrom ADHD expert psychiatrists\\n\\nthat reductions in dosage over time\\n\\noften are optimal for a patient, okay?\\n\\nAnd this gets to the whole issue of dosage generally.\\n\\nYou know, I spend a good amount of time talking to somebody\\n\\nwho prescribes these drugs, both to children and adults,\\n\\nabout dosage ranges.\\n\\nAnd I don't want to spend too much time on this\\n\\nfrom the perspective of how much one should take.\\n\\nIn fact, I don't want anyone to think\\n\\nthat what I'm about to say\\n\\nshould dictate what they should take specifically\\n\\nbecause that's something that really has to be worked out\\n\\non an individual basis.\\n\\nBut it is worth noting that if you look at the studies\\n\\non Adderall and methylphenidate,\\n\\nyou'll see it is a pretty broad range in those studies.\\n\\nAnd that's because some of the studies used people\\n\\nthat were already taking these drugs\\n\\nand asked them to participate in neuroimaging studies.\\n\\nOther studies actually put people on these drugs\\n\\nfor the very first time or adjusted their dosage.\\n\\nAnd so you'll see a tremendous range of drug doses\\n\\nexplored.\\n\\nFor instance, you will see anywhere\\n\\nfrom 10 to 40 milligrams of Adderall per day.\\n\\nYou'll see anywhere from 10 to 60 milligrams\\n\\nof Ritalin per day.\\n\\nAnd here we could easily be talking about studies\\n\\non children or adults.\\n\\nWith respect to Vivance,\\n\\nyou'll see that the dosages tend to be much higher.\\n\\nIn part, that's because Vivance has, if you recall,\\n\\nit's that lysine, which is a big molecule\\n\\nstuck on D-amphetamine, which is a smaller molecule.\\n\\nAnd so the dosages of Vivance tend to be\\n\\nin the hundreds of milligram ranges,\\n\\nbut most of that hundred milligrams of Vivance\\n\\nis not going to be the D-amphetamine.\\n\\nIt's going to be the lysine, which doesn't do anything\\n\\nin the context of treating the brain.\\n\\nIt's just there to control the slow release.\\n\\nSo it's thought that a hundred milligrams of Vivance\\n\\ntranslates to roughly nine milligrams of Adderall\\n\\nand on and on.\\n\\nAnd actually it's pretty hard to translate\\n\\nbetween dosages of different drugs in any direct way.\\n\\nAnd in speaking with a psychiatrist expert in ADHD\\n\\nin preparation for this episode,\\n\\nhe made very clear that it is extremely,\\n\\nextremely difficult to predict how a child or adult\\n\\nwill react to a given dosage of any of these drugs.\\n\\nSo much so in fact that he anecdotally reported to me\\n\\nthat one of his patients is a male, 300 pounds,\\n\\ndiagnosed with ADHD and who achieves tremendous relief\\n\\nfrom just 2.5 milligrams of Adderall per day.\\n\\nAnd at the same time, he has two patients,\\n\\nboth of whom are sisters, so they're genetically related,\\n\\nwho are in the 120 to 140 pound range,\\n\\nwho did not respond well at all for the treatment\\n\\nof their ADHD until their dosages were very, very high.\\n\\nAnd if I tell you these dosages,\\n\\nI just want to warn you in advance,\\n\\nI'm not suggesting anyone explore these dosages\\n\\nwithout of course the approval of their psychiatrist.\\n\\nTurns out that neither of these two young women\\n\\nresponded at all to ADHD medication\\n\\nuntil they achieved dosages in the range of 180\\n\\nin the case of one sister and 240 milligrams\\n\\nin the case of the other sister per day,\\n\\nwhich is an astronomically high dose on the face of it.\\n\\nBut this physician, again, board certified physician,\\n\\nexpert in ADHD, verified for me that indeed\\n\\nneither of them experienced any discomfort or side effects\\n\\nthat led them to not want to take the drug.\\n\\nBut of course that amount of Adderall\\n\\ncould send somebody else into an absolute psychotic fit,\\n\\ncould potentially even cause cardiac arrest.\\n\\nI mean, it's remarkable the ranges of Adderall\\n\\nthat are used effectively in children and adults.\\n\\nAnd this is true for a lot of the other sympathomimetics\\n\\nused to treat ADHD.\\n\\nAnd of course a good psychiatrist will always assess dosage\\n\\nas it relates to positive benefits, relief of symptoms.\\n\\nSo relief of impulsivity, relief of hyperactivity,\\n\\nimprovements in ability to focus.\\n\\nAnd of course they are going to consider side effects,\\n\\nany uncomfortable adverse effects that come\\n\\nfrom taking the drug at a given dosage\\n\\nor taking the drug at all.\\n\\nNow, of course this all begs the question\\n\\nof why such tremendous variation is this\\n\\ndue to genetic differences in the amount of dopamine\\n\\nor norepinephrine that people make.\\n\\nIt appears that the major underlying factor\\n\\nfor why people require such vastly different dosages\\n\\nof these sympathomimetics for the relief of ADHD\\n\\nhas to do with the different enzymes\\n\\nor levels of enzymes that people make\\n\\nwhich metabolize these drugs, both in the brain and body.\\n\\nAnd unfortunately, there is no simple blood test\\n\\nor saliva test or test of any kind\\n\\nthat can predict how someone will respond to these drugs.\\n\\nSo the most logical and safe way to assess dosage\\n\\nis to start with the lowest possible effective dose\\n\\nand to increase only as necessary\\n\\nin order to achieve the positive benefits\\n\\nwhile of course paying attention\\n\\nto any side effects that might arise.\\n\\nA question that comes up from time to time\\n\\nwhen discussing the long-term effects\\n\\nof drugs like Adderall, Ritalin and Vivance\\n\\nis whether or not they can negatively impact height\\n\\nor growth or development in some other way.\\n\\nThis is a logical question to ask\\n\\nbecause after all these drugs\\n\\nare effectively mimicking stress in the body.\\n\\nAnd most everyone has heard by now\\n\\nthat while stress can help us in the short term,\\n\\nit helps us deploy immune molecules\\n\\nto protect us against infection.\\n\\nIt sharpens our visual focus\\n\\nand our ability to respond to things for survival,\\n\\nchronically elevating our stress over long periods of time,\\n\\nwe know reduces the effectiveness of our immune system\\n\\nand can actually cause certain forms of brain degeneration.\\n\\nAnd while there aren't a lot of longitudinal studies\\n\\non the heights of kids with ADHD,\\n\\nand of course we never can tell\\n\\nhow tall someone would have grown to be\\n\\nif they were treated with a drug\\n\\nbecause we don't have a perfect control experiment\\n\\neven in the case of identical twin experiments\\n\\nand there aren't that many of those examples\\n\\nwhere one twin was treated for ADHD\\n\\nand the other wasn't, et cetera.\\n\\nBut here's what we know,\\n\\nit does not appear that treatment\\n\\nwith sympathomimetics during development,\\n\\nprovided the dosages are kept in the appropriate ranges,\\n\\nis going to limit overall height.\\n\\nIn fact, if you look at the data,\\n\\nit appears that children with ADHD\\n\\nwho are treated with ADHD meds\\n\\nactually arrive at slightly higher BMIs, body mass indexes,\\n\\ncompared to age-matched peers.\\n\\nNow, of course, body mass index\\n\\ndoesn't necessarily correlate with height, right?\\n\\nSomeone could not achieve a full height,\\n\\nbut could be heavier either through bone or fat\\n\\nor muscle or combination of all three.\\n\\nBut what we know is that the appropriate use\\n\\nof ADHD meds during development\\n\\nis not stunting development in any kind of overall way.\\n\\nIt's not preventing maturation of the body\\n\\nin ways that are leading to reduced weight\\n\\nor somehow impaired growth overall.\\n\\nWith that said, long-term elevations\\n\\nof sympathetic nervous system activity\\n\\ndoes carry some risk.\\n\\nAnd one of the primary risks\\n\\nthat people have wondered about is cardiovascular risk.\\n\\nAnd this makes perfect sense, right?\\n\\nWhen you increase the activity\\n\\nof the sympathetic nervous system,\\n\\nyou increase blood pressure, you increase heart rate,\\n\\nyou increase, in some cases, peripheral sweating,\\n\\nall the things that we associate with stress.\\n\\nSo you can imagine that a child or adult with ADHD\\n\\nthat takes these sympathomimetics every day,\\n\\neven if the dosage is kept in a range\\n\\nthat doesn't allow them to experience\\n\\nany immediate untoward side effects,\\n\\nso they're not feeling miserable,\\n\\nthey're just feeling like they can focus better,\\n\\nbut one always wonders what's going on\\n\\nunder the hood, so to speak.\\n\\nThere is, as far as I know,\\n\\none major study that's addressed this,\\n\\nand the conclusions of that study\\n\\nwere a little bit hard to put into a single category.\\n\\nIt did point to a subtle increase in cardiovascular risk,\\n\\nbut the results did not point to anything so dramatic\\n\\nthat the authors of the study warned\\n\\nagainst taking these drugs or encouraging people\\n\\nto cease taking these drugs,\\n\\nagain, provided they're being prescribed\\n\\nby a board-certified physician for ADHD\\n\\nand at the appropriate dosage for that person.\\n\\nThat said, I think this all, again,\\n\\nspeaks to the importance of arriving\\n\\nat minimal effective dosage,\\n\\nand it stands to reason that if you're somebody\\n\\nwho's taking ADHD meds,\\n\\nor if your child is taking ADHD meds,\\n\\nthat one would want to do all the other things\\n\\nthat they could do in order to try\\n\\nand improve cardiovascular health,\\n\\nor at least not put it at additional risk.\\n\\nSo those are going to be the obvious things\\n\\nlike avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine.\\n\\nRegular exercise is going to be encouraged\\n\\nand things of that sort.\\n\\nAnd that dovetails into a bunch of other questions\\n\\nthat are often asked any time the topic of Adderall\\n\\nor Ritalin comes up, which is, what about alcohol?\\n\\nYou know, is drinking alcohol at the same time\\n\\nor at different times even going to be problematic\\n\\nif one is taking these drugs,\\n\\nis taking benzodiazepines going to be a problem,\\n\\net cetera, et cetera.\\n\\nThere's a very straightforward answer to this,\\n\\nwhich is, it's very clear that alcohol,\\n\\ncertainly in children, but also in adults,\\n\\nis best not consumed.\\n\\nI did an entire episode about alcohol,\\n\\nwhich got into this and the data for this.\\n\\nIf you've heard that having some alcohol,\\n\\nin particular red wine, is better for you than no alcohol,\\n\\nthat is simply not true.\\n\\nSorry, it's not true.\\n\\nMost adults who are not alcoholics\\n\\ncan probably have up to two, that's right,\\n\\ntwo drinks per week and still be on the safe side of health,\\n\\nalthough zero is better than two.\\n\\nAnd once you get past two,\\n\\nyou start seeing effects on various systems,\\n\\nincluding increased cancer risk,\\n\\nespecially brain neuron loss and degeneration risk.\\n\\nI covered all of those data in the episode on alcohol\\n\\nthat you can find at hubermanlab.com.\\n\\nCombining alcohol with sympathomimetics,\\n\\neven though they reside in very different pathways\\n\\nwithin the brain, in fact,\\n\\nthe sympathomimetics are driving up\\n\\nsympathetic nervous system activity,\\n\\nwhereas alcohol is actually doing the opposite,\\n\\nit's depressing it.\\n\\nAnd yet, all the data point to the fact\\n\\nthat combining alcohol with sympathomimetics,\\n\\nsuch as Bivance, Adderall, Ritalin,\\n\\nor any kind of amphetamine,\\n\\nis going to be more detrimental to the brain and body\\n\\nthan simply taking those drugs on their own.\\n\\nPut differently and more directly,\\n\\nif you are taking any of the drugs\\n\\nthat we've been talking about to treat ADHD,\\n\\nor if you just happen to be taking them for whatever reason,\\n\\nyou are going to want to avoid drinking alcohol at any time,\\n\\nand you're going to want to avoid benzodiazepines\\n\\nand similar, unless they've been prescribed to you\\n\\nby your physician.\\n\\nIn advance of this episode,\\n\\nI put a call out on social media for questions\\n\\nabout Adderall, et cetera,\\n\\nand I got a lot of questions\\n\\nabout whether or not there are impacts of these drugs\\n\\non the hormone systems of the body,\\n\\nand if they impact the reproductive system in particular.\\n\\nI also got questions about whether or not these drugs\\n\\nimpact sexual behavior or libido or anything of that sort.\\n\\nIn reviewing the literature,\\n\\nwhat I can tell you is that there are very few studies,\\n\\nunfortunately, of the long-term effects of these drugs\\n\\non the endocrine or hormone systems of the body.\\n\\nBut we do know a few things for sure.\\n\\nFirst of all, when you increase the activity\\n\\nof the sympathetic nervous system for long periods of time,\\n\\nyou are very likely increasing levels of cortisol.\\n\\nCortisol is a, quote unquote, stress hormone,\\n\\nbut cortisol also plays some really important\\n\\npositive roles in your body.\\n\\nIn fact, if you want cortisol released,\\n\\nespecially early in the day,\\n\\nyou don't want cortisol released so much late in the day.\\n\\nThis actually relates back to timing\\n\\nand schedules of taking drugs.\\n\\nThis is something, again, that needs to be worked out\\n\\nwith your psychiatrist or your child psychiatrist.\\n\\nBut one of the reasons why there are so many different drugs\\n\\nfor the treatment of ADHD is that each and all of them\\n\\nhas a different time course of action.\\n\\nSo Ritalin is very short-lived, which might sound bad\\n\\nbecause then you have to take it multiple times\\n\\nthroughout the day.\\n\\nBut if you think about from the perspective of sleep\\n\\nand the importance of having low cortisol at night\\n\\nand these drugs increase cortisol\\n\\nand the importance of getting sleep,\\n\\nbecause after all, sleep is the foundation of mental health,\\n\\nphysical health and performance in kids and adults.\\n\\nIt's responsible for growth.\\n\\nIt's when neuroplasticity happens.\\n\\nIt's just so vitally important.\\n\\nA lot of the drugs that we've been talking about\\n\\ncan severely limit one's ability to fall and stay asleep.\\n\\nAnd so a short-acting drug like Ritalin\\n\\nis actually attractive from the perspective\\n\\nof being able to take it in the morning\\n\\nand still get to sleep at night,\\n\\nor taking it in the morning and in the afternoon\\n\\nand maybe even again in the evening,\\n\\ndepending on the person,\\n\\nand then still being able to fall asleep at night.\\n\\nWhereas long duration release of DMphetamine,\\n\\nwhich is what you get when you take Vyvanse,\\n\\nfor some people is going to inhibit their sleep.\\n\\nThey'll get a nice steady rise and improvement in focus\\n\\nand reduction in hyperactivity,\\n\\nbut they might have a lot of trouble\\n\\nfalling asleep at night.\\n\\nAnd Adderall, having a somewhat intermediate\\n\\ntime course of action between Ritalin,\\n\\nwhich is short-lived and Vyvanse, which is very long-lived,\\n\\nperhaps is going to be the best solution for somebody else\\n\\nwhere they can take it early in the day,\\n\\nperhaps at a low dose, maybe again later in the day,\\n\\nlow dose, and then still fall asleep at night.\\n\\nBut I've spoken to people\\n\\nand I spoke to this clinician expert in ADHD\\n\\nwho told me that some people will take as little\\n\\nas 2.5 milligrams of Adderall at 6 a.m.\\n\\nand have a hard time falling asleep later that night\\n\\nat 11 p.m.\\n\\nSo again, vastly different sensitivities to these drugs\\n\\nleading to vastly different requirements of dosage\\n\\nand timing of intake and which particular drug\\n\\nsomebody might choose to or choose not to take.\\n\\nSo how does that relate to hormones\\n\\nand sex and reproduction?\\n\\nWell, cortisol itself is a hormone.\\n\\nIt can act as a bit of a hormone\\n\\nand a neurotransmitter in the brain,\\n\\nbut for the most part,\\n\\nit's acting as a hormone in the brain and body.\\n\\nAnd it does a number of things.\\n\\nFirst of all, it can enhance your levels\\n\\nof focus and alertness.\\n\\nIt can activate your immune system.\\n\\nI know the immunologists out there just cringe\\n\\nwhen I say activate the immune system.\\n\\nYour immune system is always doing various things.\\n\\nSo it's always active just as your nervous system\\n\\nis always active.\\n\\nBut it can, to be specific,\\n\\nit can amplify or mobilize the release\\n\\nof anti-inflammatory molecules in your brain and body\\n\\nto combat different types of bacterial,\\n\\nviral and fungal infections.\\n\\nIt's doing an enormous number of positive things.\\n\\nIt's also involved in setting mood.\\n\\nIt has interactions with thyroid hormone pathways.\\n\\nI've done entire episodes about cortisol\\n\\nand cortisol regulation to paint all of that\\n\\nwith a very broad brush.\\n\\nAnd briefly now, it's advantageous\\n\\nto have your cortisol release high\\n\\nin the early part of the day\\n\\nand to taper off toward the end of the day.\\n\\nIn fact, late day elevations in cortisol\\n\\nare a strong correlate of depressive symptoms.\\n\\nThis was demonstrated by my colleagues,\\n\\nDavid Spiegel and Robert Sapolsky\\n\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\n\\nBut that is not to say that cortisol is bad.\\n\\nIt's to say that the timing of cortisol release is key.\\n\\nSo do these sympathomimetic drugs\\n\\ndisrupt the endocrine system?\\n\\nWell, they can.\\n\\nIf you are very awake and very alert,\\n\\nregardless of whether or not you're taking\\n\\nyour sympathomimetic treatment for ADHD\\n\\nearly in the day or late in the day,\\n\\nyou are very likely experiencing elevations in cortisol\\n\\nlate in the day.\\n\\nSo it is important, even for those of you\\n\\nthat like to study and need to focus\\n\\nin the evening and nighttime hours,\\n\\nthat you try and limit your levels of overall alertness\\n\\nand certainly stress late in the day.\\n\\nBecause doing that day after day after day\\n\\nfor several weeks or months or years\\n\\ncan indeed disrupt other hormones in the endocrine system.\\n\\nAnd again, that's because cortisol is interacting\\n\\nwith thyroid hormone and testosterone and estrogen.\\n\\nIn fact, cortisol in many ways competes with\\n\\nor can outcompete for the production of testosterone\\n\\nand other so-called steroid hormones.\\n\\nRemember, cortisol itself is a corticosteroid hormone.\\n\\nSo when we hear the word steroids,\\n\\noftentimes people just think about athletes\\n\\nand steroid abuse in sports.\\n\\nBut steroid hormones includes a lot of different types\\n\\nof hormones, which are good for us.\\n\\nOur endogenous steroid hormones are vital\\n\\nfor all sorts of things, vitality, reproduction, et cetera.\\n\\nAnd the way this works in general terms\\n\\nis that the cholesterol molecule is used\\n\\nto create testosterone and cortisol and estrogen.\\n\\nIf we make too much cortisol,\\n\\nwe in many ways are reducing the total amount\\n\\nof testosterone that we make or that is active.\\n\\nIt's not exactly that straightforward,\\n\\nbut we can make that statement with confidence.\\n\\nFor instance, if you spike your cortisol\\n\\njust briefly during the day,\\n\\nbecause you have some sort of stressful event,\\n\\nthat's not going to inhibit your testosterone.\\n\\nIn fact, it probably is going to boost\\n\\nyour testosterone levels somewhat.\\n\\nHowever, if your cortisol levels are chronically elevated,\\n\\nyes, indeed, it's likely that you're going to suppress\\n\\nyour total and or free unbound forms of testosterone.\\n\\nAnd downstream to that, you will experience effects\\n\\nsuch as reductions in libido,\\n\\nreductions in muscle and bone mass,\\n\\nreductions in all sorts of aspects\\n\\nof testosterone-related psychology and bodily biology.\\n\\nThis is true for both males and females.\\n\\nAnd the same thing could be said for estrogen.\\n\\nNow, what's impossible for us to say\\n\\nis whether or not taking a given treatment for ADHD\\n\\nis going to, for instance, prevent a woman from ovulating.\\n\\nThat could happen through chronic elevations in cortisol,\\n\\nbut there's no direct link,\\n\\nmeaning there are no studies, at least that I'm aware of,\\n\\nshowing that people that take Adderall\\n\\nhave irregular ovulatory cycles\\n\\nor that they cease menstruating entirely.\\n\\nI don't think there's any evidence for that whatsoever,\\n\\nnor is there any evidence that people that take Adderall\\n\\nor other sympathomimetics for the treatment of ADHD\\n\\nhave lower overall testosterone.\\n\\nIn fact, you can imagine all sorts of instances\\n\\nin which the opposite was true,\\n\\nthat a child or young adult or adult who has ADHD\\n\\nbut then goes on these meds to improve their symptoms\\n\\nis now focusing and achieving more in life.\\n\\nWe know that happiness can impact dopamine\\n\\nand vice versa and testosterone levels\\n\\nand productivity itself and reaching our goals\\n\\ncan feed back on the hormone system.\\n\\nSo anytime there's a discussion about hormones\\n\\nor a study that shows that doing X or not doing Y\\n\\nimpacts hormone levels of a given type,\\n\\nwe have to be very careful to make sure\\n\\nthat we're talking about causality\\n\\nbecause all of these hormones\\n\\nare in a very intricate crosstalk with one another.\\n\\nWe can, however, make a very general statement,\\n\\nwhich is that when you are in states of stress\\n\\nfor long periods of time,\\n\\nthat is not a favorable condition for your immune system,\\n\\nyour hormone system,\\n\\nor frankly any other system in the brain and body.\\n\\nSo the treatment of ADHD with these drugs\\n\\nshould never be done at the expense\\n\\nof these other critical biological systems.\\n\\nAnother common question and concern is whether or not kids,\\n\\nand I suppose for that matter,\\n\\nadults that take medication for ADHD\\n\\nare basically being predisposed to psychosis\\n\\nand or other forms of addiction.\\n\\nAnd earlier we talked a bit about the risk for addiction\\n\\nand the take-home message there is very clear\\n\\nthat kids and adults that are treated for ADHD appropriately,\\n\\nso with the appropriate dosage of the appropriate drugs\\n\\nunder the supervision\\n\\nof a board certified qualified psychiatrist\\n\\nare at less risk for forming addictions\\n\\nto other substances in adulthood\\n\\nor other substances generally.\\n\\nI think a lot of people also wonder whether or not\\n\\nthose kids and those adults that take these ADHD meds\\n\\nbecome addicted to the medications themselves.\\n\\nThat's a bit of a tricky issue to resolve.\\n\\nAnytime one stops taking a drug or even tapers off a drug\\n\\nthat's used to treat something\\n\\nwhere they feel better on the drug,\\n\\nthey're going to experience two sets of effects.\\n\\nAnd these two sets of effects\\n\\nare often confounded with one another.\\n\\nOne is the withdrawal effects.\\n\\nSo the effects of removing the drug\\n\\nthat makes somebody feel less good than baseline.\\n\\nSo for instance, a kid that takes ADHD meds\\n\\nuntil they're late teens or early 20s\\n\\ndecides they're going to taper off.\\n\\nThey do that and they're feeling lousy during the taper\\n\\nor when they reduce their dosage to zero,\\n\\ntheir foggy brain, they can't focus,\\n\\nthey feel a little bit depressed mood.\\n\\nIt's unclear whether or not those are withdrawal symptoms\\n\\nor whether or not those are the consequence\\n\\nof not having the systems in their brain activated\\n\\nthe way that those systems were activated before.\\n\\nI realized that for some of you,\\n\\nthat might seem like the same thing,\\n\\nbut that's not necessarily the same thing.\\n\\nAnd probably the best analogy would be\\n\\nsomething along the lines of a hangover, right?\\n\\nIf somebody drinks too much on a given night,\\n\\nthe next morning they have a hangover.\\n\\nThe hangover makes them feel lousy.\\n\\nIt is actually a withdrawal from alcohol effect.\\n\\nBut then when they recover from the hangover,\\n\\nthey realize that their sober state feels pretty good.\\n\\nIt doesn't obviously feel the same as being on alcohol,\\n\\nbut that sober state is not a state of withdrawal.\\n\\nOkay, if we were to look at removal\\n\\nor tapering off of ADHD meds,\\n\\nthere's going to be a period of withdrawal symptoms.\\n\\nBut then the real question is how does somebody feel\\n\\nafter they get through those withdrawal symptoms?\\n\\nSo that's an important issue to highlight.\\n\\nNow, in terms of psychosis,\\n\\nthis is a very interesting and very important literature.\\n\\nFirst of all, any amphetamine,\\n\\nwhether or not it's D-amphetamine, L-amphetamine,\\n\\nand also methylphenidate for that matter,\\n\\nRitalin, can induce psychosis.\\n\\nNow, there are a number of different factors\\n\\nthat are going to predispose somebody to psychosis.\\n\\nHaving a first relative who's had psychotic episodes,\\n\\neither schizophrenic episodes or bipolar episodes\\n\\nis certainly a strong predisposition.\\n\\nOf course, if an individual themselves\\n\\nhave had psychotic episodes,\\n\\nthat's the strongest predisposition that one can imagine.\\n\\nSo having a first relative with schizophrenia\\n\\nor with bipolar depression,\\n\\nor it's sometimes called bipolar disorder,\\n\\nsometimes it's also just called bipolar these days,\\n\\nis going to be a strong predisposition for psychotic episodes\\n\\nmade much greater anytime one takes a sympathomimetic drug\\n\\nsuch as amphetamine, but also methylphenidate, Ritalin,\\n\\nis going to increase that likelihood of psychotic episodes.\\n\\nThen comes the question of,\\n\\nif somebody has a psychotic episode\\n\\nas the consequence of taking any of these drugs,\\n\\nwhether or not it's been prescribed for ADHD or not,\\n\\nwill those psychotic symptoms go away\\n\\nafter the person stops taking the drug?\\n\\nThere appears to be a divide in the literature,\\n\\nor rather a divide according to drug,\\n\\nsuch that people that take Ritalin, methylphenidate,\\n\\nand have a psychotic episode,\\n\\noften, not always, but most often,\\n\\nif they stop taking methylphenidate,\\n\\nthe psychotic episode will cease.\\n\\nNot always the case, but most oftentimes it will cease.\\n\\nWhereas in individuals who have a predisposition to psychosis,\\n\\nor even if they're not aware of a predisposition to psychosis\\n\\nand they take Adderall, which as you recall,\\n\\nis a combination of D and L-amphetamine,\\n\\nthey can have psychotic episodes\\n\\nthat sometimes are very long-lasting,\\n\\neven after the cessation of the drug.\\n\\nAnd while that might sound kind of shocking\\n\\nand really scary, and indeed it is scary,\\n\\nit perhaps shouldn't shock us that much,\\n\\nbecause if you recall D-amphetamine,\\n\\nwhich there's a lot of in Adderall,\\n\\nit's a very potent way of increasing dopamine.\\n\\nAnd anytime you potently increase dopamine,\\n\\nin a person who has a predisposition to psychotic episodes,\\n\\nyou are shifting the whole system\\n\\ntoward a greater propensity for psychosis.\\n\\nThis would also be the appropriate time\\n\\nto talk about meth, methamphetamine.\\n\\nAgain, methamphetamine is considered an illicit drug,\\n\\na drug of abuse.\\n\\nIt is responsible for a lot of the misfortune and tragedy\\n\\nthat you see on the streets of major cities\\n\\nand even outside of major cities and rural areas.\\n\\nIt has all sorts of negative effects on health,\\n\\nincluding oral health, cardiovascular health.\\n\\nIt is neurotoxic to serotonergic neurons,\\n\\nso it kills serotonin neurons, that is absolutely clear.\\n\\nIt kills dopaminergic neurons, that is absolutely clear.\\n\\nOne of the ways that methamphetamine creates\\n\\nso many of the problems that it does,\\n\\nmeaning effects on the body,\\n\\nabuse potential, addictive potential,\\n\\nthe fact that methamphetamine can spark psychosis\\n\\nin those that have a predisposition to psychosis,\\n\\nbut also that it can create psychosis in individuals\\n\\nwho have no predisposition to psychosis, right?\\n\\nAll of this points to methamphetamine\\n\\njust being a terrible drug all around.\\n\\nAnd yet, if you recall back to the beginning of the episode,\\n\\nthere is one form of prescription methamphetamine,\\n\\nbut its uses are extremely narrow,\\n\\nand it's probably best left out of this conversation\\n\\nbecause its uses are so, so narrow in the clinical sense.\\n\\nI managed to talk to one expert.\\n\\nThis is a board-certified psychiatrist who's expert in ADHD\\n\\nwho is also very familiar with the psychosis symptoms\\n\\ninduced by methamphetamine and by various ADHD drugs\\n\\nin people who have the predisposition.\\n\\nThey made it very clear that any of the sympathomimetic\\n\\nADHD drugs that are of the amphetamine variety,\\n\\nso that would be Adderall and extended-release Adderall,\\n\\nthat would be pure dexedrine,\\n\\nor any variants that include amphetamine\\n\\nare going to have higher likelihood of inducing psychosis\\n\\nin people that have a predisposition to psychosis.\\n\\nAnd yet, they did assure me\\n\\nthat at appropriately prescribed and safe dosages,\\n\\nthat the total incidence of psychosis\\n\\nin people that take those drugs is still fairly low\\n\\nand not that much greater than in the general population,\\n\\nalthough there is an increased risk.\\n\\nIt's not that severe.\\n\\nAnd they also highlighted the fact\\n\\nthat methylphenidate Ritalin carries a lower potential\\n\\nfor inducing psychosis, not zero,\\n\\nbut a lower level of inducing psychosis\\n\\nthan for the amphetamine-type sympathomimetics.\\n\\nNow, one exception is Vyvanse,\\n\\nthat long-release D-amphetamine that we talked about earlier.\\n\\nThere does seem to be something protective\\n\\nabout that long-duration release of D-amphetamine\\n\\nthat occurs with Vyvanse,\\n\\nwhich is not to say that there's zero abuse\\n\\nor addictive potential with Vyvanse.\\n\\nI was told by this same individual\\n\\nthat indeed they've had knowledge of patients\\n\\ntrying to increase the rate of absorption of Vyvanse\\n\\nand release of Vyvanse,\\n\\nor technically of the D-amphetamine,\\n\\nin order to get more of a high from Vyvanse\\n\\nas opposed to just the extended release.\\n\\nBut they did assure me, however,\\n\\nthat Vyvanse seems to be associated\\n\\nwith fewer psychotic episodes\\n\\nand less abuse and addictive potential overall,\\n\\nwhich again is not to say that it's a perfectly safe drug,\\n\\nbut really this just highlights the fact\\n\\nthat the kinetics or the time course\\n\\nof dopamine and norepinephrine release\\n\\nthat's caused by a given drug\\n\\nis going to correlate very strongly\\n\\nwith its abuse potential and addictive potential\\n\\nand its potential to induce psychotic episodes.\\n\\nAnd this is where the discussion about meth\\n\\nbecomes especially relevant.\\n\\nOne of the reasons why meth is so dangerous\\n\\nin terms of its addictive potential\\n\\nand its potential to induce psychotic episodes\\n\\nis first of all, how much dopamine it releases.\\n\\nAgain, five times more than any of the other drugs\\n\\nthat we've been talking about,\\n\\nbut also how fast that peak comes on.\\n\\nIt's a very fast onset.\\n\\nAnd that's true whether or not people are snorting it,\\n\\nwhether or not they're taking it orally,\\n\\nor especially if they inject it intravenously.\\n\\nBut meth, because it increases dopamine so fast\\n\\nand to such a great degree,\\n\\nand then the peak in dopamine comes down very fast as well,\\n\\nand it drops below the baseline levels of dopamine\\n\\nthat were present initially,\\n\\nthat's one of the reasons why methamphetamine\\n\\nis so dangerous in terms of addiction\\n\\nand in terms of psychotic episodes.\\n\\nThis gets back to a bunch of issues\\n\\nwe've talked about before on the Huberman Lab podcast\\n\\nabout dopamine kinetics.\\n\\nAnd I've done two episodes on dopamine\\n\\nthat I'll refer you to.\\n\\nOne is called dopamine motivation and drive,\\n\\nwhich is all about dopamine and regulating dopamine.\\n\\nAnd the other one is about optimizing dopamine.\\n\\nIt's more of a toolkit focused episode,\\n\\nboth those you can find at hubermanlab.com.\\n\\nBut the general takeaway that's relevant\\n\\nfor what we're talking about now is that with dopamine,\\n\\nit's not just about the absolute levels of dopamine\\n\\nthat are reached,\\n\\nbut how long lasting those increases in dopamine are.\\n\\nSo with Vyvanse, even though Vyvanse is DMphetamine,\\n\\nit's fairly potent, not as potent as meth,\\n\\nbut fairly potent at increasing dopamine and norepinephrine.\\n\\nIt's a long extended release in dopamine and norepinephrine,\\n\\nwhich reduces its overall abuse potential\\n\\nbecause it doesn't tend to create\\n\\nthat immediate euphoria and high,\\n\\nand then crash below baseline.\\n\\nA lot of you will hear that it increases dopamine a lot\\n\\nand then stays up as translating to,\\n\\nokay, well then you're just euphoric for 16 hours,\\n\\nbut that's not the case.\\n\\nWhen it comes to dopamine,\\n\\nit's an issue of how high that peak is\\n\\nand whether or not that peak is stable\\n\\nor whether or not it comes down again.\\n\\nAnd when it comes to psychotic episodes\\n\\nor addictive potential,\\n\\nit seems that any drug or behavior\\n\\nthat increases dopamine very quickly\\n\\nand then brings dopamine down very quickly\\n\\nis what sets the high potential for addiction and abuse\\n\\nand for inducing psychotic episodes.\\n\\nSo that's why I'm talking about these two things\\n\\nin parallel.\\n\\nAnd now it should be very clear\\n\\nwhy Vyvanse doesn't have so much addictive\\n\\nand abuse potential and has at least lower potential\\n\\nfor inducing psychotic episodes.\\n\\nAnd it should also be clear to you\\n\\nthat for people who do not have ADHD as a child,\\n\\nor for people that do not have ADHD in adulthood,\\n\\nif they were to take any,\\n\\ntruly any of the compounds that we're talking about thus far,\\n\\nmethylphenidate, Ritalin, Adderall, Vyvanse, Dexedrine,\\n\\nand certainly methamphetamine,\\n\\nwhat we observe from neuroimaging studies\\n\\nis that these people get enormous increases in dopamine.\\n\\nThey're not familiar with these drugs,\\n\\nso the increases in dopamine are just cosmic for them.\\n\\nThey experience a lot of euphoria.\\n\\nEven if the dosages are low,\\n\\nthe euphoria is associated\\n\\nwith a very heightened degree of focus\\n\\nthat they've never really felt before.\\n\\nHere, what I'm talking about is a lot of the recreational\\n\\nand off-prescription use of Adderall and things like it.\\n\\nAnd what we know is that that sets in motion\\n\\nboth a potential for abuse and addiction\\n\\nto that feeling and substance,\\n\\nas well as a higher potential\\n\\nfor psychotic episodes down the road, okay?\\n\\nSo put differently, children who have ADHD\\n\\nand are prescribed any of these drugs,\\n\\nor adults who have ADHD\\n\\nand are prescribed any of these drugs,\\n\\nwho take them for some period of time,\\n\\nare actually at lesser risk to all of the issues\\n\\nrelated to having chronically elevated\\n\\nand greatly elevated dopamine as a kind of first-time event\\n\\nor as a rare event.\\n\\nWhereas anyone who takes these drugs without a prescription\\n\\nand decides, okay, I want to focus more,\\n\\nor I'm going to use this to stay up for a couple of days,\\n\\nin other words, using it recreationally\\n\\nor using it for, quote unquote, performance enhancement,\\n\\nis at far greater risk for addiction to these substances\\n\\nbecause of the amplitude and the time course of dopamine\\n\\nthat results when one takes these drugs just out of the blue.\\n\\nAnd so for that reason,\\n\\nI really want to caution everybody\\n\\nagainst using any of the compounds\\n\\nthat I've discussed thus far,\\n\\nunless it's been prescribed to you by a physician\\n\\nfor the specific purpose of ADHD.\\n\\nNow, I'm sure someone out there is screaming from the back,\\n\\nwait, if a kid takes these drugs\\n\\nbecause they're prescribed them for ADHD,\\n\\nthe very first time they take them,\\n\\nthey're going to have a huge amplitude dopamine response.\\n\\nOr if an adult goes in and talks to their psychiatrist\\n\\nand says, you know, I'm having issues with focusing\\n\\nand they're prescribed one of these meds for ADHD\\n\\nand they take it,\\n\\nthey're going to have a huge amplitude dopamine response.\\n\\nIsn't that going to set in motion all the same things\\n\\nthat somebody who is using these drugs recreationally\\n\\nwould have?\\n\\nAnd indeed, that's one of the reasons\\n\\nwhy a lot of psychiatrists will start\\n\\nwith a very low dosage or the lowest possible dosage\\n\\nto see how somebody responds to that low dosage.\\n\\nAnd then over time might or might not increase that dosage.\\n\\nIn fact, they might even bring it down further,\\n\\ndepending on how sensitive somebody is to the drug.\\n\\nBut equally important is the fact\\n\\nthat it is the repeated taking of that drug\\n\\nby the child with ADHD or by the adult with ADHD\\n\\nthat actually leads to lesser and lesser peaks\\n\\nin dopamine each time, which is not to say\\n\\nthat the person becomes entirely desensitized\\n\\nto the effects of the drug,\\n\\nbut rather that the system equilibrates\\n\\nthrough what's called homeostatic plasticity,\\n\\nit's sometimes referred to broadly as habituation to a drug.\\n\\nBut there are systems in the brain and body\\n\\nthat regulate the connections between neurons\\n\\nso that if dopamine and norepinephrine are elevated\\n\\nabove baseline levels for a while,\\n\\nthe system normalizes so that instead,\\n\\nthe connections between neurons become stronger\\n\\nand there isn't the critical requirement\\n\\nfor all that increase in dopamine and norepinephrine.\\n\\nI realize that might sound a little bit technical,\\n\\nbut basically what I'm saying is the response\\n\\nthat somebody has to taking a drug for the first time\\n\\nis far and away different than the response\\n\\nto a drug that somebody has\\n\\nif they are taking the same drug day after day after day.\\n\\nThis gets to another issue,\\n\\nwhich is not discussed that often these days,\\n\\nbut that is really important.\\n\\nIf you go back to the original clinical literature\\n\\non these sympathomimetics,\\n\\nwhat you'll find is that the original use\\n\\nof these sympathomimetics to treat childhood ADHD\\n\\nsuggested that children not take these drugs\\n\\nevery single day.\\n\\nNow, I'm not recommending that kids take drug holidays\\n\\nbecause I'm not a clinician,\\n\\nI'm not promoting any specific dose or dosing regimen,\\n\\nbut in speaking again to a psychiatrist expert in ADHD,\\n\\nwho by the way is going to be a guest on this podcast\\n\\nin the not too distant future,\\n\\nwhat he told me was that many of these drugs\\n\\nwere designed to be taken during the school week\\n\\nfor children with weekends off\\n\\nor during the school year with weekends off,\\n\\nbut then also with vacations during the summer holidays.\\n\\nAnd that these days, rarely if ever,\\n\\nis that the pattern of intake that these kids are following\\n\\nand why that is has interesting sociological\\n\\nand financial explanations.\\n\\nI'm not alluding to any kind of conspiracy here,\\n\\nbut this is an aspect of the dosing with these drugs\\n\\nthat has sort of fallen away in recent years,\\n\\nbut I think is really interesting\\n\\nand it's something that actually was supported\\n\\nfor the treatment of adult ADHD as well.\\n\\nAgain, there's a very different biological\\n\\nand neuroplastic response to taking a drug once\\n\\nversus taking a drug for say five days\\n\\nand then taking weekends off to taking a drug\\n\\nover and over again every single day\\n\\nfor a pattern of years.\\n\\nAnd when exploring the literature\\n\\nin preparation for this episode,\\n\\nI confess it was a bit dizzying to find answers\\n\\nto what are the long-term effects of taking Adderall\\n\\nor what are the long-term effects of taking Vyvanse, et cetera.\\n\\nIn fact, most of the literature on the long-term effects\\n\\nof taking drugs to treat ADHD\\n\\nhas focused on methylphenidate on Ritalin.\\n\\nThere are studies on Vyvanse and Adderall\\n\\nand actually those were the studies\\n\\nthat I will link in the show note captions primarily\\n\\nbecause that's where most of the interest is these days.\\n\\nThe reason why so many of the studies\\n\\nhave focused on methylphenidate on Ritalin\\n\\nis largely because that was one of the first drugs\\n\\nused to treat ADHD.\\n\\nSo in terms of addressing long-term effects\\n\\nof kids treated with ADHD meds,\\n\\nthose kids are now adults\\n\\nand therefore can be neuroimaged and assessed.\\n\\nWhereas a lot of kids that have been prescribed Adderall\\n\\nor Vyvanse or similar\\n\\nhave not yet made it to stages of life\\n\\nin which we can answer that question directly.\\n\\nThere are a few studies\\n\\nand I've made it clear to include those studies\\n\\nin my description of results today.\\n\\nIn particular, the results I talked about earlier\\n\\nwhere there's an improvement in executive function\\n\\nin kids that have taken ADHD meds\\n\\nor adults that have taken ADHD meds\\n\\nfor a longer period of time,\\n\\nanywhere from months to years,\\n\\nthose studies did include both Adderall and Vyvanse\\n\\nand methylphenidate and again, I'll link to those studies.\\n\\nBut by and large, most of what we know\\n\\nabout the long-term effects of any of these drugs\\n\\nhas to do primarily with studies of methylphenidate.\\n\\nI'd like to spend a little bit of time\\n\\ntalking about some compounds\\n\\nthat are not considered amphetamines at all\\n\\nbut that are now being used to treat ADHD\\n\\nboth in children and adults more frequently.\\n\\nThe major drug in this category\\n\\nof non-amphetamine treatments for ADHD is modafinil,\\n\\nwhich is also called by its commercial name, Provigil.\\n\\nThere's a variance on this, which is armodafinil,\\n\\nwhich goes by the brand name Nuvigil.\\n\\nThe major difference between modafinil and armodafinil,\\n\\naside from having a slight chemical difference,\\n\\nis that modafinil was released first.\\n\\nArmodafinil is the second in the generation of these drugs\\n\\nand modafinil tends to be very expensive.\\n\\nThat's one of the reasons why it's prohibitive\\n\\nfor some people to take.\\n\\nIt can be as expensive as $25 a pill or more,\\n\\nso more than $1,000 per month.\\n\\nAnd armodafinil tends to be far, far less expensive.\\n\\nI've talked to a couple experts\\n\\nabout whether or not there are any genuine differences\\n\\nbetween these two drugs and they report no,\\n\\nalthough consumers of these drugs, for whatever reason,\\n\\nwhether or not it's placebo or not,\\n\\nreport yes, there is a difference.\\n\\nWhen I say placebo, I in no way mean\\n\\nthat these drugs are just acting as placebo.\\n\\nI just mean that people tend to get very attached\\n\\nto certain drugs and whether or not the brand name\\n\\nor the generic version works better for them.\\n\\nThere's all sorts of lore about this.\\n\\nIn fact, there are a lot of people out there\\n\\nwho strongly feel that brand name Adderall works better\\n\\nthan generic Adderall for them.\\n\\nThere are a lot of people out there\\n\\nwho say the same thing about Vivance.\\n\\nThere are a lot of people out there\\n\\nwho say the same thing about Ritalin\\n\\nand all sorts of drugs.\\n\\nWhether or not that's true or not is unclear.\\n\\nIt is clear that generic versions of drugs can use binders\\n\\nand other things that are in the pill or capsule\\n\\nthat are different than what the brand name pill\\n\\nor capsule uses as binders to hold the drug together.\\n\\nAnd that can impact rates of release and metabolism, et cetera.\\n\\nBut a lot of this is just lore.\\n\\nIn fact, I went into the literature\\n\\nto try and find any real concrete support\\n\\nfor the idea that generic Adderall is less potent\\n\\nor less effective than brand name Adderall.\\n\\nAnd despite the tens of thousands of people\\n\\nwho will say to the contrary,\\n\\nI could not find any peer-reviewed published data about that.\\n\\nSo who knows, maybe it's a belief effect as it's called.\\n\\nMaybe there's a real difference there.\\n\\nNowadays Modafinil and Armodafinil are prescribed\\n\\nfor a huge range of daytime sleepiness issues.\\n\\nAnd we were talking about narcolepsy,\\n\\nbut there are also people who suffer\\n\\nfrom daytime sleepiness related to dementia,\\n\\ndaytime sleepiness related to post-surgery anesthesia.\\n\\nSo there's this thing where people have surgery\\n\\nand then they come out of surgery\\n\\nand they feel better for a few days,\\n\\nbut then they find that they aren't recovering\\n\\ntheir normal levels of wakefulness.\\n\\nSo it's prescribed sometimes to try and get people back\\n\\ninto a normal state of wakefulness.\\n\\nIt's been prescribed for traumatic head injury, after stroke.\\n\\nAgain, all of these prescribed uses have to be carried out\\n\\nby a certified physician.\\n\\nYou really don't want to start cowboying\\n\\nthe use of Modafinil or Armodafinil\\n\\nor any other prescription drug for that matter.\\n\\nI must say that in discussing all these different drugs\\n\\nduring today's episode, I have zero knowledge\\n\\nof any of these drugs from a firsthand experience\\n\\nexcept for Armodafinil.\\n\\nBack in 2017, I was prescribed a very, very low dose\\n\\nof Armodafinil for jet lag,\\n\\nfor daytime sleepiness issues really,\\n\\nwhen I was traveling overseas to give a talk.\\n\\nSo Armodafinil was given to me in a 25 milligram tablet.\\n\\nIt was advised to me that I take a half\\n\\nor even a quarter of that.\\n\\nSo I started with a quarter.\\n\\nI am a believer in minimal effective dose.\\n\\nI'm also somebody who's fairly hypersensitive\\n\\nto most medications.\\n\\nSo I took what I measured out to be five to seven milligrams\\n\\nof Armodafinil and what I experienced was pretty profound.\\n\\nCertainly it relieved any daytime sleepiness.\\n\\nIn fact, it made me feel extremely alert\\n\\nfor a period of about four to six hours.\\n\\nI can't say it was the most comfortable state,\\n\\nalthough I did not feel as if I had racing heart\\n\\nor anything of that sort.\\n\\nI basically felt as if I was in a narrow tunnel\\n\\nof attention for that entire period.\\n\\nOne thing I did not like about the experience\\n\\nis that it was a very hard experience to come down from.\\n\\nThere was no crash,\\n\\nbut I found that that high arousal state\\n\\ndidn't taper off for many hours later.\\n\\nEven though it was most heightened for four hours,\\n\\nI would say anywhere from eight to 12 hours later,\\n\\nI still felt like I was blinking once\\n\\nevery four minutes or so.\\n\\nAnd I've certainly been accused on this podcast\\n\\nand at other times of blinking too seldom.\\n\\nTo my knowledge, I don't have ADHD.\\n\\nI've never been prescribed ADHD meds.\\n\\nI've never been tested for ADHD.\\n\\nI don't think I have ADHD.\\n\\nAnd yet taking Armodafinil certainly increased\\n\\nmy levels of attention,\\n\\nbut at least by that one experience,\\n\\nit's not something that I would want to repeat again.\\n\\nI certainly would not want to be in that state\\n\\nfor learning new material.\\n\\nWhen I sit down to research a podcast\\n\\nor research papers in my lab or forage for information\\n\\nor learn from people or books or lectures or podcasts,\\n\\nI want to be in a state of alertness but calm\\n\\nwhere I can really consider the ideas\\n\\nwhere I can script things out by hand.\\n\\nI'm a big believer in writing things out by hand\\n\\nto remember them later, drawing little diagrams.\\n\\nI would not want to be in the state\\n\\nthat even that very low dose of Armodafinil\\n\\nput me in in order to learn.\\n\\nAnd I should mention that both Modafinil and Armodafinil\\n\\nare associated with a good number of side effects\\n\\nif they don't agree with you\\n\\nor if the dosage is too high.\\n\\nThings like decreased appetite,\\n\\npeople can get a runny nose, headache.\\n\\nThere's this instance of skin rashes.\\n\\nIn fact, one of the reasons why Modafinil and Armodafinil\\n\\naren't more broadly prescribed\\n\\nis that there's a very rare skin condition\\n\\nin which people who have taken certain drugs,\\n\\nnot just Modafinil or Armodafinil\\n\\nhave developed these very severe burn type blisters.\\n\\nAnd in some cases, this can be fatal.\\n\\nThis is again, very rare.\\n\\nAnd it was observed in at least one patient\\n\\nwho took Modafinil as part of a trial\\n\\nfor Modafinil as a treatment for ADHD.\\n\\nIt's called Stevens-Johnson syndrome.\\n\\nPlease, if you are squeamish to images of skin abrasions\\n\\nand lesions and things of that sort,\\n\\nplease don't look it up on the internet\\n\\nunless you're able to handle that.\\n\\nAnd maybe not at all.\\n\\nBut the point here is that one of the reasons\\n\\nthat Modafinil and Armodafinil\\n\\nare not more widely prescribed for ADHD\\n\\nand that it's still only prescribed off label\\n\\nis that Stevens-Johnson syndrome\\n\\nwas flagged as kind of a potential risk.\\n\\nAlthough the ADHD specialists that I spoke to\\n\\nare somewhat frustrated with that\\n\\nbecause they insist that the frequency of this syndrome\\n\\nthat causes the skin rash that's sometimes fatal\\n\\nis no more frequent in those that took Modafinil\\n\\nin this trial than with other drugs that have been approved.\\n\\nSo this gets into all sorts of issues\\n\\naround what drugs make it to approval and which ones don't.\\n\\nAnd as we know, Modafinil and Armodafinil\\n\\nare already being prescribed in the general population\\n\\nfor other things.\\n\\nThis was dealing specifically with the question\\n\\nof whether or not it should be prescribed in kids with ADHD.\\n\\nAnd certainly I am a proponent of exerting extreme caution\\n\\nwhen thinking about which drugs should be approved\\n\\nfor the treatment of anybody, but especially kids.\\n\\nAnd to round out our discussion of drugs used\\n\\nfor the treatment of ADHD that fall into,\\n\\nlet's call it the atypical category, right?\\n\\nThe typical category being Adderall-Vivance,\\n\\nmethylphenidate, and things of that variety.\\n\\nThe less typical would be Modafinil, Armodafinil,\\n\\nBupririn, Wilbutrin, and so forth.\\n\\nThe last in this category of atypical is guanfacine.\\n\\nGuanfacine is an interesting compound.\\n\\nIt's a compound that was developed to lower blood pressure\\n\\nand indeed it does lower blood pressure.\\n\\nAnd it is an alpha 2A agonist,\\n\\nalpha 2A being a receptor for norepinephrine.\\n\\nSo guanfacine is a non-stimulant medication to treat ADHD.\\n\\nAnd it's also used to treat some other conditions as well\\n\\nthat is only working on the noradrenergic system.\\n\\nIt is not tapping into the dopamine system.\\n\\nBut all the other stuff that we talked about\\n\\nis really ramping up dopamine and norepinephrine.\\n\\nGuanfacine is only increasing norepinephrine\\n\\nand it's doing so by what we say agonizing\\n\\nor stimulating one particular aspect\\n\\nof the noradrenergic system, and that's the alpha 2A system.\\n\\nWhat's interesting about guanfacine\\n\\nis that it has a bunch of pathways that it activates\\n\\nthat feed back onto the autonomic nervous system\\n\\nto dampen down the activation\\n\\nof the sympathetic nervous system.\\n\\nSo whereas most of what we talked about today\\n\\nare sympathomimetics, they tend to make us more ramped up,\\n\\nmore aroused and alert.\\n\\nGuanfacine is doing the opposite.\\n\\nAnd as a consequence, it's not prescribed that often\\n\\nbecause a lot of times when people take guanfacine,\\n\\nit either has no effect on ADHD symptoms\\n\\nor it tends to make people feel very sleepy.\\n\\nHowever, there's a small subset of individuals,\\n\\nabout five to 10% of people that try it,\\n\\nincluding kids that do get some significant relief\\n\\nfrom their ADHD symptoms.\\n\\nAnd they seem to tolerate guanfacine better\\n\\nthan they're tolerating some of the other drugs\\n\\nthat we've talked about up until now.\\n\\nThe way guanfacine works is also really interesting.\\n\\nYou're now familiar with the locus coeruleus,\\n\\nthis packet, or we call it a nucleus of neurons\\n\\nin the back of the brain\\n\\nthat release norepinephrine at other sites in the brain.\\n\\nAnd they're going to be those alpha 2A receptors\\n\\nthat guanfacine works on and stimulates\\n\\nlots of different places in the brain\\n\\nrelated to increasing salience\\n\\nand relevance of particular stimuli that we see\\n\\nand that we need to attend to.\\n\\nIt appears that guanfacine can activate\\n\\nthe prefrontal cortical networks\\n\\nin ways that are above their normal baseline.\\n\\nSo that's good.\\n\\nSo improvements in executive function,\\n\\nthat orchestra or teacher-like function\\n\\nwe talked about before,\\n\\nand can increase the efficacy of that output\\n\\nfrom locus coeruleus.\\n\\nAnd what that seems to do is increase the coordinated firing\\n\\nof locus coeruleus neurons with prefrontal cortex.\\n\\nSo in many ways, it's acting like a fine tuning\\n\\nof that orchestra conductor operation\\n\\nthat is so valuable in teaching these brain circuits\\n\\nduring childhood of how to attend to one thing\\n\\nand ignore everything else.\\n\\nSo this is one reason why guanfacine is now approved,\\n\\nnot just for adults with ADHD,\\n\\nbut is primarily used in kids aged six to 17 years old\\n\\nfor the treatment of ADHD.\\n\\nAgain, with the hope that these kids can take the drug\\n\\nand these circuits can learn how to focus\\n\\nand how to attend to certain things\\n\\nand limit impulsivity and hyperactivity,\\n\\nand then perhaps come off the drugs.\\n\\nAlthough sometimes, again,\\n\\npeople have to stay on them indefinitely.\\n\\nThe other thing about guanfacine\\n\\nis that because it lowers blood pressure\\n\\nand it has this effect of kind of dampening down\\n\\noverall sympathetic arousal,\\n\\nsometimes it is prescribed in conjunction\\n\\nwith other ADHD meds.\\n\\nSo yes, there are kids out there and adults out there\\n\\nwho are taking Adderall and guanfacine\\n\\nor they're taking Vivance and guanfacine.\\n\\nAnd this is where it starts to get into drug cocktails\\n\\nand a bunch of other things\\n\\nthat gets everybody a little bit uncomfortable, I think,\\n\\nbecause the idea of taking one drug\\n\\nto dampen down the side effects of another drug\\n\\nand to offset things and compensate\\n\\nis getting towards what's called polypharmacology.\\n\\nAnd I think it's understandable\\n\\nthat people be concerned about that.\\n\\nAnd yet, again, in reviewing this\\n\\nwith some of the experts on ADHD,\\n\\nthere do seem to be a certain category\\n\\nof children out there and adults\\n\\nwho really struggle with the standard ADHD meds.\\n\\nAnd in that case, guanfacine has provided\\n\\na certain number of these individuals tremendous relief.\\n\\nOne note about guanfacine, in no way, shape or form,\\n\\nam I encouraging anyone\\n\\nwho's not prescribed guanfacine to take it?\\n\\nBut should you know someone who's taking guanfacine\\n\\noff label in order to improve their focus\\n\\nor enhance any aspect of their biology or psychology,\\n\\nplease let them know that it has a profound effect\\n\\non lowering the tolerance for alcohol\\n\\nsuch that even small amounts of alcohol\\n\\ncan lead to really serious problems\\n\\nand even potentially death.\\n\\nSo that's a very serious warning with guanfacine.\\n\\nSo today we discussed a lot of different compounds\\n\\nfor the treatment of ADHD.\\n\\nAnd it now should become clear\\n\\nwhat the general themes of those compounds is.\\n\\nThe general theme is that they tend to increase\\n\\noverall levels of arousal and wakefulness,\\n\\nwhich leads to decreased levels of hyperactivity,\\n\\nimpulsivity and focus.\\n\\nAnd on the face of it, that might seem counterintuitive,\\n\\nraise arousal to reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity.\\n\\nIndeed, that's the case because these compounds,\\n\\nbecause they act on neuromodulator systems\\n\\nlike dopamine and norepinephrine\\n\\nare effective in creating neuroplasticity.\\n\\nThey change the strength of the connections\\n\\nin the neural circuits of the brain\\n\\nthat lead to states of heightened focus\\n\\nand reduced impulsivity and reduced hyperactivity.\\n\\nSo we talked about the different mechanisms\\n\\nby which the different medications for ADHD\\n\\naccomplish this, both the typical sort\\n\\nlike methylphenidate and Adderall and Vivance\\n\\nand some of the atypical compounds\\n\\nthat are now being used in addition,\\n\\nsuch as modafinil, armodafinil, guanfacine and wellbutrin.\\n\\nAnd where possible, I tried to highlight\\n\\nboth the short and long-term effects\\n\\nof these various compounds.\\n\\nAnd I tried to address some of the major concerns\\n\\nabout these compounds, most notably the question of\\n\\nwhy are we putting so many kids on amphetamine\\n\\nand what is the long-term consequence of that?\\n\\nAnd throughout today's episode,\\n\\nI tried to highlight both the immediate\\n\\nand long-term benefits, but also the immediate\\n\\nand long-term risks that can exist with these compounds.\\n\\nCertainly when taken without a prescription recreationally,\\n\\nthere is a real risk for abuse and addiction\\n\\nas well as even the risk for psychotic episodes,\\n\\nbut also the risks that accompany long-term use\\n\\nof these drugs in people with ADHD.\\n\\nAnd yet it is also clear that not treating the symptoms\\n\\nof ADHD carries significant risk as well.\\n\\nAnd what's very clear from the scientific\\n\\nand clinical literature and is covered\\n\\nin a significant amount of detail\\n\\nin the episode that I did about ADHD,\\n\\nwhich you can find at hubermanlab.com,\\n\\nis that combinations of drug treatments\\n\\nand behavioral protocols seem to surpass\\n\\neither drug treatments or behavioral protocols alone.\\n\\nSpeaking to the tremendous importance\\n\\nof combining multiple methodologies when treating ADHD\\n\\nand working with a board-certified psychiatrist\\n\\nwho really understands ADHD and is really up to date\\n\\non all the latest scientific and clinical literature.\\n\\nIf you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast,\\n\\nplease subscribe to our YouTube channel.\\n\\nThat's a terrific zero-cost way to support us.\\n\\nIn addition, please

       " Document(page_content=\"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\n\\nwhere we discuss science\\n\\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\\n\\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\\n\\nand I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology\\n\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\n\\nToday, we are discussing how to build tenacity\\n\\nand willpower.\\n\\nPrevious episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast\\n\\nhave focused on the topic of motivation.\\n\\nAnd while motivation and willpower\\n\\nare linked thematically and mechanistically,\\n\\ntoday we are going to discuss tenacity,\\n\\nthat is, the willingness to persist under pressure\\n\\nand resistance of different kinds, and willpower,\\n\\nwhich has to do with both the motivation to do things\\n\\nand the motivation to resist certain things.\\n\\nToday, you will learn about the psychology and neuroscience\\n\\nof tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nAnd I must tell you, this is a fascinating literature.\\n\\nIn fact, you will learn about a brain structure\\n\\nthat, at least to my knowledge,\\n\\nmost neuroscientists are not even aware of.\\n\\nAnd yet, in researching this episode,\\n\\nI absolutely fell in love with this brain structure\\n\\nbecause of its incredible ability to integrate\\n\\nthe very sorts of information from within\\n\\nand from outside of you\\n\\nto harness and build tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nAnd indeed, today you will learn research-supported tools\\n\\nfor how to enhance your level of tenacity and willpower\\n\\nin any circumstance.\\n\\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\\n\\nthat this podcast is separate from my teaching\\n\\nand research roles at Stanford.\\n\\nIt is, however, part of my desire and effort\\n\\nto bring zero cost to consumer information about science\\n\\nand science-related tools to the general public.\\n\\nIn keeping with that theme,\\n\\nI'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.\\n\\nOur first sponsor is Maui Nui Venison.\\n\\nMaui Nui Venison is the most nutrient-dense\\n\\nand delicious red meat available.\\n\\nI've spoken before on this podcast,\\n\\nin solo episodes and with guests,\\n\\nabout the need to get approximately one gram\\n\\nof high-quality protein per pound of body weight each day\\n\\nfor optimal nutrition.\\n\\nNow, there are many different ways that one can do that,\\n\\nbut a key thing is to make sure that you're not doing that\\n\\nby ingesting excessive calories.\\n\\nMaui Nui Venison has the highest density\\n\\nof quality protein per calorie,\\n\\nand it achieves that in delicious things\\n\\nlike ground meats, venison steaks, jerky, and bone broth.\\n\\nI particularly like the ground venison.\\n\\nI make those into venison burgers\\n\\nprobably five times a week or more.\\n\\nI also like the jerky for its convenience,\\n\\nespecially when I'm traveling\\n\\nor I'm especially busy with work,\\n\\nand know that I'm getting an extremely

unique sleep needs.\\n\\nNow, sleep is the foundation of mental health,\\n\\nphysical health, and performance.\\n\\nWhen we are sleeping well and enough,\\n\\nmental health, physical health, and performance\\n\\nall stand to be at their best.\\n\\nOne of the key things to getting a great night's sleep\\n\\nis to make sure that your mattress\\n\\nis tailored to your unique sleep

to $350 off and two free pillows.\\n\\nOkay, let's talk about tenacity and willpower\\n\\nand how to enhance your level of tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nI will also mention certain cases\\n\\nwhere having too much tenacity and willpower\\n\\ncan be problematic for mental health and physical health.\\n\\nBut for most people, I believe that enhancing one's level\\n\\nof tenacity and willpower would be advantageous.\\n\\nNow, you'll be relieved to know that while there are\\n\\na near infinite number of different circumstances\\n\\nwhere one would need to draw on tenacity and willpower\\n\\nin order to succeed,\\n\\nthere is one major mechanism within the brain,\\n\\nindeed one major mechanism,\\n\\nby which tenacity and willpower are generated.\\n\\nAnd it arrives through the activation\\n\\nof a particular brain center that is a hub.\\n\\nThat is, it lies at the interface\\n\\nof many other neural circuits\\n\\nand has input from all the critical neural circuits\\n\\nthat one would need in order to generate\\n\\ntenacity and willpower.\\n\\nNow, we are going to return to that particular neural circuit\\n\\na little bit later after we talk about\\n\\nthe psychology of willpower,\\n\\nbecause in talking about the psychology of willpower,\\n\\nit will frame up as to why understanding\\n\\nthis one particular brain center or hub of inputs\\n\\nand outputs from different neural structures\\n\\nin the brain and body will indeed allow you\\n\\nto get the most out of the tools\\n\\nthat have been shown in scientific research\\n\\nto enhance your level of tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nIn other words, understanding the psychology\\n\\nof tenacity and willpower while valuable,\\n\\nif it's coupled with an understanding\\n\\nof the underlying neural mechanism,\\n\\nand notice I used the singular neural mechanism,\\n\\nnot mechanisms for generating tenacity and willpower,\\n\\nwill allow you to use and to tailor the specific protocols\\n\\nfor enhancing tenacity and willpower\\n\\nto your unique circumstances.\\n\\nSo this is yet another case\\n\\nwhere certainly life circumstances vary\\n\\nfrom one person to the next.\\n\\nThe need for tenacity and willpower varies tremendously.\\n\\nFor instance, some people may need more tenacity\\n\\nand willpower in order to engage in certain behaviors.\\n\\nOthers of us might need more tenacity and willpower\\n\\nin order to resist certain types of behaviors.\\n\\nToday, you will learn about the brain center\\n\\nthat governs all of that.\\n\\nAnd then you can frame it\\n\\nwithin the psychological understanding\\n\\nof tenacity and willpower\\n\\nso that you can get the most out of the protocols\\n\\nthat we will discuss.\\n\\nLet's start by talking about\\n\\nwhat tenacity and willpower clearly are\\n\\nand separating tenacity and willpower\\n\\nfrom some other psychological constructs\\n\\nthat they often get confused with\\n\\nbecause this will be important\\n\\nin understanding exactly what we are trying to build\\n\\nwhen we say we want to build tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nSo tenacity and willpower can be distinguished\\n\\nfrom habit execution.\\n\\nHabit execution is what you do\\n\\nanytime you wake up in the morning,\\n\\nmaybe you lie there for a bit,\\n\\nmaybe you get out of bed immediately,\\n\\nhopefully you get outside and get some sunlight in your eyes,\\n\\nespecially on cloudy days,\\n\\ngo brush your teeth, use the restroom,\\n\\nengage with others in your home\\n\\nif you live with others, et cetera.\\n\\nAll of those sorts of behaviors,\\n\\nwhile on some days can be a bit more challenging,\\n\\nespecially the get out of bed part,\\n\\nmaybe you didn't get a great night's sleep\\n\\nthe night before, for instance,\\n\\nbut all of those sorts of behaviors\\n\\nare behaviors that you have the neural circuits to generate\\n\\nand that typically you can generate\\n\\nwithout a lot of willpower required.\\n\\nNow willpower, sometimes also referred to as tenacity,\\n\\ngrit or persistence,\\n\\nis a distinctly different phenomenon\\n\\nthan habit execution\\n\\nbecause willpower and tenacity require\\n\\nthat we intervene in our own default neural processes,\\n\\nsuch as habits or particular patterns of thinking,\\n\\nand essentially govern ourselves\\n\\nto do or not do some particular thing.\\n\\nAnd that process requires effort, it requires energy.\\n\\nAnd I think all of us are familiar\\n\\nwith that feeling of effort or energy\\n\\nthat's required in order to engage in a behavior\\n\\nthat we really don't feel like engaging in\\n\\nor avoiding a behavior or a thought\\n\\nthat by default we would naturally just engage in.\\n\\nAnd when I talk about energy in this context,\\n\\nI'm mainly talking about neural energy.\\n\\nRemember that neurons, nerve cells in your brain and body\\n\\nuse chemical and electrical signaling\\n\\nto communicate with one another.\\n\\nThat's what allows you and all of us\\n\\nto do all the things that we do,\\n\\nthink, feel, move, et cetera.\\n\\nNow, of course, that chemical and electrical communication\\n\\nrequires fuel sources that indeed\\n\\ncome from things like glucose, ketones,\\n\\nthe creatine phosphate system,\\n\\nmultiple fuel systems feed the energetics of the brain.\\n\\nBut ultimately, when I talk about energy\\n\\nin today's discussion,\\n\\nI'm talking about the energy required to engage in\\n\\nor to resist in a particular behavior.\\n\\nAnd that level of energy can be quite high\\n\\ndepending on how much resistance we are feeling internally\\n\\nor externally, right?\\n\\nSomebody can be telling us\\n\\nyou're not going to be able to do this,\\n\\nyou can't do it and you can say,\\n\\nno, I have a ton of resolve, I have a ton of tenacity,\\n\\nand I'm going to push past all the barriers\\n\\nthat you are setting up for me on the outside.\\n\\nOftentimes, all too often, I should say,\\n\\nwe experience resistance from the inside\\n\\nwhere we are feeling like we don't want to do something\\n\\nor we really want to do something\\n\\nand we are having trouble either engaging in the thing\\n\\nthat we don't want to do or that we know we should do,\\n\\nbut we just don't feel that level of motivation for,\\n\\nor we are having a hard time resisting the thing\\n\\nthat's pulling us toward it.\\n\\nSo in that context, it's important for us\\n\\nnot to just distinguish tenacity and willpower\\n\\nfrom habit execution,\\n\\nbut also draw out a continuum with tenacity and willpower\\n\\nat their most extreme on one end of that continuum\\n\\nand apathy and yes, depression\\n\\non the other end of that continuum.\\n\\nAnd we will return to the topic of depression\\n\\na little bit later, but I can just cue it up right now\\n\\nby saying that one of the hallmark features\\n\\nof major depression is a lack of positive anticipation\\n\\nabout the future that leads to,\\n\\nthis is important, there's a verb tense here\\n\\nthat leads to a much lower tendency to engage\\n\\nin the specific types of behavior\\n\\nthat would allow one to arrive at a particular new,\\n\\ndifferent and positive future.\\n\\nSo I'm deliberately putting apathy and depression\\n\\nnext to one another at one end of the continuum\\n\\nand I'm putting grit, persistence, tenacity and willpower\\n\\nat the other end of the continuum.\\n\\nAnd a little bit later, it will become very clear to you\\n\\nwhy I put those particular items on the continuum\\n\\nas opposed to other psychological constructs\\n\\nsuch as motivation, because it turns out that motivation\\n\\nis what allows you to move up and down that continuum,\\n\\nbut motivation itself as a verb is distinct\\n\\nfrom what we call tenacity and willpower\\n\\nand motivation itself is distinct\\n\\nfrom what we call apathy and depression.\\n\\nBut motivation is the engine or the motor, the verb\\n\\nthat allows you to move up and down that continuum.\\n\\nAnd today you will learn multiple tools\\n\\nthat will allow you to move toward the tenacity\\n\\nand willpower end of that continuum\\n\\nby engaging a very specific neural circuit.\\n\\nBefore we get into the discussion of neural circuits,\\n\\nI'd like to talk about the psychology of willpower.\\n\\nAnd this is something that really has been considered\\n\\nby psychologists for well over a hundred years.\\n\\nWilliam James wrote about this,\\n\\nthe ancient Greeks wrote about this.\\n\\nThe topic of willpower is certainly not a new one.\\n\\nAnd yet the formal study of willpower\\n\\nin the laboratory context,\\n\\nthat is bringing human subjects into the laboratory\\n\\nand examining what sorts of conditions allow them\\n\\nto engage their willpower and tenacity.\\n\\nWhat sorts of conditions really sap\\n\\nor drain their willpower and tenacity.\\n\\nAnd of course, parallel experiments done\\n\\nin what we call preclinical models,\\n\\nwhich are animal studies have revealed to us a lot\\n\\nabout the sorts of conditions that allow us\\n\\nto generate willpower and the sorts of conditions\\n\\nthat drain our willpower.\\n\\nNow, if we are to throw our arms around\\n\\nthat entire literature,\\n\\nthere is a big batch of that literature,\\n\\nnot the whole batch,\\n\\nbut there's a big batch of that literature\\n\\nthat believed and still believes\\n\\nthat willpower is a limited resource,\\n\\nmuch like fuel in the body or fuel in a car.\\n\\nNow, the idea of willpower as a limited resource\\n\\nis certainly not a new idea,\\n\\nbut again, the formal study of willpower\\n\\nand willpower as a limited resource\\n\\nreally dates back a little over 20, 25 years\\n\\nwhen Roy Baumeister and colleagues\\n\\nstarted to explore the idea\\n\\nthat of course had been kicked around for years,\\n\\nthat with each additional decision\\n\\nthat we have to engage across the day\\n\\nand with each additional bout of willpower\\n\\nthat we have to draw on as a resource,\\n\\nthat we would drain this reservoir of willpower\\n\\nthat we all have within us.\\n\\nNow, Baumeister and colleagues referred to that process\\n\\nas ego depletion.\\n\\nNow, when people hear the word ego,\\n\\nsome people think Freud, ego, super ego, id, and so forth.\\n\\nMost people think ego,\\n\\nlike somebody having a big personality\\n\\nwhere they think a lot of themselves.\\n\\nWhen Baumeister referred to ego depletion,\\n\\nhe was defining ego depletion as a concept of oneself\\n\\nand a concept of outside challenges\\n\\nand the degree of effort required\\n\\nto bridge one's concept of self and those challenges.\\n\\nAnd so ego depletion is really a operational construct\\n\\nwithin the field of psychology.\\n\\nSo we don't want to get too distracted by that word ego.\\n\\nThere's a tendency anytime people hear ego,\\n\\nif they hear narcissism or if they hear gaslighting\\n\\nto immediately assume that they know what that means,\\n\\nwhen in fact, the formal definitions of those\\n\\nquite often differ from the way that they're kicked around\\n\\non social media, the internet,\\n\\nand even in a lot of popular writing about psychology.\\n\\nOkay, so let's just note that ego depletion\\n\\nis the term that Baumeister used to describe\\n\\nthe ability for our willpower to be depleted\\n\\nwith each successive attempt to engage willpower.\\n\\nAnd by extension, our ability to replenish\\n\\nour degree of willpower if we take a break\\n\\nfrom making decisions and engaging our willpower.\\n\\nBut ego depletion itself isn't the focus right now.\\n\\nThe focus right now is whether or not indeed,\\n\\nwillpower is a limited resource\\n\\nand whether or not with each decision that we make\\n\\nand each effort to either engage in an activity\\n\\nthat we prefer not to, at least in that moment,\\n\\nand with each attempt to resist a behavior,\\n\\nthought, et cetera, that is pulling on us\\n\\nor that we feel that we want to engage in by default,\\n\\neither eating the cookie or thinking the thought\\n\\nor engaging in a particular type of behavior of any kind,\\n\\nand we need to resist that,\\n\\nthat it is draining that willpower resource.\\n\\nNow, before I go any further,\\n\\nI know that some of you out there are probably aware\\n\\nthat ego depletion and the Baumeister theory\\n\\nof willpower as a limited resource\\n\\nhas been very contentious, especially in recent years.\\n\\nAnd so today, what I'm going to do\\n\\nis I'm going to first present the Baumeister\\n\\nand colleagues work about willpower as a limited resource.\\n\\nAnd then I'm going to present\\n\\nsome of the conflicting evidence that Carol Dweck,\\n\\nmy colleague at Stanford School of Medicine\\n\\nand researchers elsewhere have carried out meta-analyses\\n\\nand entirely new experiments,\\n\\nwhich indeed in some cases contradict\\n\\nthe findings of Baumeister,\\n\\nbut more often than not contradict the conclusions\\n\\nthat Baumeister drew about willpower.\\n\\nSo if we are to understand the psychology\\n\\nof willpower and tenacity,\\n\\nit's important that we understand the concepts\\n\\nof ego depletion and willpower as a limited resource,\\n\\neven if after hearing all the evidence,\\n\\nyou decide that willpower is not a limited resource.\\n\\nAnd in fact, I'm quite confident\\n\\nthat once you hear about the Baumeister work,\\n\\nand then you hear about the work of Dweck and others,\\n\\nwhich in some ways counters the conclusions of Baumeister,\\n\\nthat you'll have a much firmer\\n\\nand certainly much more complete understanding\\n\\nabout what tenacity and willpower are.\\n\\nAnd perhaps, and here I'm revealing my own leanings\\n\\nwhen having examined the totality of the data,\\n\\nthat tenacity and willpower in some cases\\n\\nis a limited resource that can be replenished\\n\\nby engaging particular processes within the body.\\n\\nThat's right, within the body,\\n\\nbut that willpower and tenacity,\\n\\nand most importantly, how to engage tenacity and willpower,\\n\\nespecially when you have a lot of challenges in front of you,\\n\\nnot just one challenge,\\n\\nbut multiple challenges that need to be carried out\\n\\nthroughout the day, over weeks, over months, et cetera,\\n\\nthat tenacity and willpower can be drawn upon repeatedly\\n\\nwithout them being depleted,\\n\\nif you are clear on your beliefs\\n\\nabout tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nSo I realized that what I just brought up was a controversy\\n\\nabout something that I haven't even discussed yet.\\n\\nSo it might seem like a bit of a swirl of information\\n\\nfor which there's really no context.\\n\\nBut the reason I bring up the controversy\\n\\nat this stage of our conversation\\n\\nis that the moment that the words ego depletion\\n\\nor willpower is a limited resource falls out of my mouth,\\n\\nI can hear those voices out there saying,\\n\\nwait a second, I thought that was all debunked.\\n\\nAnd I want to make very clear,\\n\\nwillpower is a limited resource\\n\\nand ego depletion have not been debunked.\\n\\nIt's simply a controversial area of psychological research.\\n\\nAnd more importantly for today's discussion,\\n\\nwe have to understand the theory of willpower\\n\\nas a limited resource.\\n\\nIf we are to understand the controversy,\\n\\nthat is the counter-argument of what willpower really is\\n\\nthat comes from other groups.\\n\\nSo I really want to give you both sides of the story\\n\\nso that when we get to the underlying neural mechanisms\\n\\nfor tenacity and willpower,\\n\\nand we get to the tools and protocols\\n\\nfor increasing your level of tenacity and willpower\\n\\nand your flexibility of willpower in different contexts,\\n\\nthat you'll be able to get the most out\\n\\nof those tools and protocols.\\n\\nOkay, so let's take a look at the evidence\\n\\nthat willpower is a limited resource.\\n\\nI think most of us are familiar\\n\\nwith what willpower feels like,\\n\\nthat is what it feels like to be tenacious.\\n\\nAnd again, there are two sides to this coin.\\n\\nThere's willpower and tenacity of the sort\\n\\nof trying to engage in a behavior\\n\\nwhen we really don't want to,\\n\\nor when our impulse is not to engage in that behavior.\\n\\nAnd I say when our impulse is not to engage\\n\\nin that behavior, because oftentimes,\\n\\nwe want to engage in the behavior.\\n\\nWe want to study, we want to learn the instrument,\\n\\nwe want to perform well, we want to exercise,\\n\\nwe want the benefits of all those things.\\n\\nSo it's not that we don't want the outcomes\\n\\nor the rewards of those things.\\n\\nAnd in many cases,\\n\\nit's not that we don't enjoy those activities,\\n\\nbut that for whatever reason,\\n\\nwe are feeling a lack of motivation.\\n\\nWe're drifting down that continuum\\n\\ntoward the more apathetic end of things,\\n\\nhopefully not all the way to deep depression and apathy,\\n\\nbut we're drifting that way.\\n\\nOr we're not far enough up the continuum\\n\\nand we're not engaging enough motivation\\n\\nto feel like the desire to do something,\\n\\neither for its own sake or for the rewards\\n\\nand outcomes of that thing are sufficient\\n\\nto allow us to just do that thing.\\n\\nHence the Nike slogan, just do it,\\n\\nwhich is a wonderful slogan,\\n\\nexcept that in the absence of any understanding\\n\\nabout the mechanisms of how we can get ourselves\\n\\nto just do something, oftentimes it falls short.\\n\\nAnd to be honest, anytime I hear about people saying,\\n\\nwell, just eliminate the thinking and just do it,\\n\\nthat is valuable advice until it doesn't work.\\n\\nBecause when it doesn't work, it simply doesn't work.\\n\\nAnd then you need to rely on other tools and mechanisms,\\n\\nwhich are the sort that we will talk about today.\\n\\nSo while I have great respect for the just do it mantra,\\n\\nwhen it doesn't work,\\n\\nit doesn't offer any alternative solutions\\n\\nto engage tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nAnd I do not know anyone on this planet.\\n\\nI don't care if you're David Goggins or Courtney DeWalter,\\n\\nthere will be days when telling yourself just do this\\n\\nor just don't do that is not going to be sufficient\\n\\nfor you to engage in the behaviors\\n\\nor resist the behaviors or thoughts\\n\\nthat you need to engage in or resist.\\n\\nThat's just reality.\\n\\nAnd we should ask ourselves, why is that reality?\\n\\nAnd this is a very important point.\\n\\nAnd in fact, really illustrates the first bucket\\n\\nof tools and protocols for increasing tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nAnd these are the tools and protocols\\n\\nthat I would categorize under the rubric of modulators.\\n\\nI've talked before on this podcast\\n\\nabout the important distinction\\n\\nbetween mediators and modulators.\\n\\nMediators are things,\\n\\neither psychological or biological, et cetera,\\n\\nthat are directly in the mechanisms\\n\\nthat generate some sort of action or emotion.\\n\\nThis could be neurochemicals like dopamine\\n\\nor serotonin and so on.\\n\\nModulators are things that can modulate,\\n\\nthat is, can change our probability\\n\\nof doing something or not doing something,\\n\\nbut they do so indirectly.\\n\\nAnd in the context of tools and protocols\\n\\nto increase our level of tenacity and willpower,\\n\\nI would be completely remiss\\n\\nif one of the sets of tools, that is the protocols,\\n\\nfor increasing the probability\\n\\nthat we can access high levels of tenacity and willpower\\n\\ndidn't include at least some of these modulators.\\n\\nSo I'm just going to spend about three minutes\\n\\non these modulators,\\n\\nbecause what we know for certain\\n\\nis that the regions of the brain that generate tenacity,\\n\\nand again, there is literally a brain hub\\n\\nfor generating willpower and tenacity,\\n\\ngets strong input\\n\\nfrom the so-called autonomic nervous system.\\n\\nThe autonomic nervous system has two major components.\\n\\nThey are referred to as the sympathetic nervous system\\n\\nand the parasympathetic nervous system.\\n\\nKeep in mind,\\n\\nbecause when most people hear the word sympathetic,\\n\\nthey think sympathy, they think emotion,\\n\\nit has nothing to do with that.\\n\\nSympa means together,\\n\\nand the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system,\\n\\nI know that's a mouthful,\\n\\nis responsible for generating states of alertness\\n\\nin our brain and body.\\n\\nEverything from panic to being alert and calm,\\n\\nour tendency to move,\\n\\nor our likelihood of moving under pressure.\\n\\nIt is also responsible for our ability to resist movement\\n\\nwhen we need to resist movement,\\n\\nand therefore it's an active process.\\n\\nSo the sympathetic nervous system\\n\\nis all the things of action,\\n\\nand when it is involved in generating inaction,\\n\\nthose are cases where inaction requires energy, okay?\\n\\nI want to be very clear about this.\\n\\nThe sympathetic nervous system\\n\\nisn't just about moving our body,\\n\\nalthough it has a lot to do with that,\\n\\nit is also responsible for our ability to resist movement\\n\\nor thought or emotion when we need to do that,\\n\\nclamp down on ourselves.\\n\\nThe parasympathetic aspect of our autonomic nervous system\\n\\nis the one that's sometimes referred to\\n\\nas the rest and digest neural circuits and chemicals,\\n\\nand that's true,\\n\\nbut there's a lot more to the parasympathetic component\\n\\nof the autonomic nervous system.\\n\\nIt's also responsible for falling asleep,\\n\\nit's responsible for us feeling relaxed,\\n\\nit is responsible for most of the states of mind and body\\n\\nin which we are quiescent,\\n\\nwhere we don't feel an impulse to move,\\n\\nor when we have a difficult time getting into action.\\n\\nSo the sympathetic and the parasympathetic aspect\\n\\nof the autonomic nervous system\\n\\nare always in a push-pull with one another.\\n\\nThink of them more or less on a teeter-totter.\\n\\nWhen one end goes up, the other end goes down.\\n\\nThey're really in competition with one another,\\n\\nand it's their balance that reflects how alert\\n\\nor how sleepy we happen to be.\\n\\nNow, the reason I'm giving you\\n\\nthis rather geeky nerd-speak nomenclature-filled discussion\\n\\nabout the autonomic nervous system\\n\\nin the context of willpower,\\n\\nis that regardless of whether or not you believe willpower\\n\\nis a limited or an unlimited resource,\\n\\nwe know one thing for sure,\\n\\nand that's that willpower and tenacity ride\\n\\non our current autonomic function.\\n\\nWe can translate that to everyday language\\n\\nby saying that when we are well-rested,\\n\\nfor instance, when we've been getting great sleep\\n\\nof sufficient duration the previous night\\n\\nand the night before that,\\n\\nour level of tenacity and willpower to engage in things\\n\\nthat we would not ordinarily engage in by default,\\n\\nand our ability to resist behaviors and thought patterns\\n\\nthat would otherwise be our default behaviors\\n\\nand thought patterns, is much higher.\\n\\nConversely, when we are not getting enough quality sleep\\n\\non a regular basis,\\n\\nour ability to call on tenacity and willpower is diminished.\\n\\nNow, that series of statements I just made\\n\\nis clearly going to be a duh for most people,\\n\\nbut it is very important to understand\\n\\nthat when we are sleep deprived,\\n\\nwhen we are in physical pain,\\n\\nwhen we are in emotional pain,\\n\\nand or when we are distracted,\\n\\nwhen we are thinking about something else\\n\\naside from what we are trying to engage tenacity\\n\\nand willpower in order to do or not do,\\n\\ntenacity and willpower will be diminished.\\n\\nNow, all of those things together are just a bigger duh.\\n\\nWe all know this.\\n\\nIf you've got a splinter in your foot,\\n\\nit's really hard to think about\\n\\nnot thinking about something else.\\n\\nIf you are extremely hungry,\\n\\nor if you had an argument with somebody\\n\\nthat you really care about\\n\\nand they said something that was particularly vexing to you,\\n\\nand it's looping around in your head,\\n\\nit's going to be very hard to engage in something else\\n\\nthat you need to do because you're going to be distracted.\\n\\nLikewise, if you're sleep deprived,\\n\\nlikewise, if you are a bit sick or run down,\\n\\nor if you're in any kind of physical or emotional pain,\\n\\nyour ability to draw on tenacity and willpower\\n\\nwill be diminished.\\n\\nSo it's an absolute truth that your ability\\n\\nto generate tenacity and willpower rides\\n\\non a reservoir of autonomic function.\\n\\nAnd today we don't really have a way of quantifying\\n\\nthe level of autonomic function or dysfunction\\n\\nin a very simple way.\\n\\nIt's not like resting heart rate,\\n\\nalthough resting heart rate is involved.\\n\\nFor instance, if you haven't slept well for a few nights,\\n\\nor if you're particularly stressed, over-trained,\\n\\nyou'll wake up in the morning\\n\\nwith a significantly elevated heart rate.\\n\\nHowever, there is no simple metric like heart rate\\n\\nor blood pressure, or even cortisol level\\n\\nthat can tell you whether or not\\n\\nyour autonomic function is in balance,\\n\\nthat is the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems\\n\\nof your autonomic nervous system\\n\\nare in the best possible balance\\n\\nto generate tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nWe don't yet have such a metric,\\n\\nalthough there are companies\\n\\nthat are starting to develop devices\\n\\nthat hopefully will give us indices\\n\\nof autonomic function or dysfunction.\\n\\nBut it is important that we acknowledge\\n\\nthat if you're not taking care\\n\\nof the foundational modulators of tenacity and willpower,\\n\\nnone of the subsequent tools and protocols\\n\\nthat we will discuss are going to help you\\n\\nthat much over time.\\n\\nYou might get tenacity and willpower to engage one day\\n\\nwhen you're very sleep deprived,\\n\\nbut it's going to be very difficult\\n\\nto consistently engage tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nFor that reason, if you have any struggles with sleep,\\n\\nthat is getting enough quality sleep\\n\\non a regular basis,\\n\\nplease see the zero cost toolkit for sleep\\n\\nthat we've put at hubermanlab.com.\\n\\nPlease also see the perfect your sleep,\\n\\nmaster your sleep episodes also at hubermanlab.com.\\n\\nAnd please also see the episode with expert guest,\\n\\nDr. Matthew Walker,\\n\\nprofessor of sleep neuroscience and psychology\\n\\nat University of California, Berkeley.\\n\\nWe just revamped the Huberman Lab website.\\n\\nSo if you go to hubermanlab.com\\n\\nand you put something like sleep into the search function,\\n\\nit will take you not just to the toolkit for sleep,\\n\\nbut to the exact timestamps\\n\\nthat will queue up particular topics\\n\\nand protocols around sleep.\\n\\nSo if you were to put sleep and light,\\n\\nit would take you to those particular protocols.\\n\\nIf you were to put sleep and magnesium threonate,\\n\\nit would take you to those particular protocols\\n\\nand so on and so forth.\\n\\nYeah, I don't want to get too far off topic here\\n\\nduring today's discussion,\\n\\nbut if you're not sleeping well,\\n\\nand if you're not managing your stress levels well,\\n\\nit's going to be much harder for you to engage\\n\\ntenacity and willpower,\\n\\nregardless of the tools you happen to use.\\n\\nAnd those tools could be everything from behavioral tools\\n\\nto supplements to prescription drugs.\\n\\nYou need to get those foundational modulators in check.\\n\\nAnd there are a lot of zero cost ways to do that\\n\\nthat are all spelled out very clearly\\n\\nat the resources I just described.\\n\\nLikewise for stress,\\n\\nif you're experiencing challenges with stress,\\n\\nboth short-term, medium-term or long-term stress,\\n\\nif you think you have elevated cortisol levels,\\n\\nwhich by the way, may not be the case,\\n\\nthere are a lot of tools for modulating stress in real time,\\n\\nincreasing your stress threshold, et cetera.\\n\\nSimply go to the hubermanlab.com website\\n\\nand put in stress threshold tools\\n\\nor stress real-time tools,\\n\\nand you'll get a bunch of zero cost tools\\n\\nthat will allow you to do that.\\n\\nIt's also worth mentioning that when we get to our discussion\\n\\nabout the neuroscience of tenacity and willpower,\\n\\nthat you will understand why autonomic health\\n\\nand autonomic function is so important\\n\\nfor our ability to engage tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nI'll just tell you right now,\\n\\nit's because the neural circuits\\n\\nof the autonomic nervous system\\n\\nprovide direct and robust input to this hub in the brain,\\n\\nthis brain location that governs our ability\\n\\nto allocate our mind and body toward particular activities\\n\\nor to resist particular activities.\\n\\nAs many of you know,\\n\\nI've been taking AG1 daily since 2012,\\n\\nso I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.\\n\\nAG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\\n\\nthat's designed to meet\\n\\nall of your foundational nutrition needs.\\n\\nNow, of course, I try to get enough servings\\n\\nof vitamins and minerals through whole food sources\\n\\nthat include vegetables and fruits every day,\\n\\nbut oftentimes I simply can't get enough servings.\\n\\nBut with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals\\n\\nand the probiotics that I need,\\n\\nand it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress.\\n\\nSimply put, I always feel better when I take AG1.\\n\\nI have more focus and energy and I sleep better,\\n\\nand it also happens to taste great.\\n\\nFor all these reasons, whenever I'm asked,\\n\\nif you could take just one supplement, what would it be?\\n\\nI answer, AG1.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try AG1,\\n\\ngo to drinkag1.com slash Huberman to claim a special offer.\\n\\nThey'll give you five free travel packs\\n\\nplus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.\\n\\nAgain, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nOkay, so let's think about the Baumeister data\\n\\non willpower as a limited resource.\\n\\nI'm going to briefly describe one of the first studies\\n\\nthat really said to the field,\\n\\nwillpower is a limited resource.\\n\\nBut I want to be clear that there are other studies like it,\\n\\nand they all generally follow the same contour.\\n\\nAnd that general contour is as follows.\\n\\nBaumeister and colleagues, and now many other laboratories,\\n\\nhave done experiments where they bring human subjects\\n\\ninto the laboratory.\\n\\nAnd those human subjects have to do something\\n\\nthat requires mental effort or energy, AKA willpower.\\n\\nThe classic example of this\\n\\nis you bring people into the laboratory.\\n\\nSome of them might actually be dieting or fasted,\\n\\nalthough not always.\\n\\nAnd there are two platters set out for them.\\n\\nOne platter contains radishes, just plain radishes.\\n\\nBy the way, I hate radishes,\\n\\nunless they're pickled radishes, I don't know why that is.\\n\\nSo these experiments picked my least favorite vegetable.\\n\\nI love many other vegetables.\\n\\nI disdain the radish.\\n\\nThat was just a personal editorial.\\n\\nIn any case, the radishes are set out,\\n\\nand next to them are freshly baked cookies.\\n\\nAnd in the room is the wafting aromas\\n\\nof freshly baked cookies.\\n\\nSo I think it's fair to say that most people,\\n\\nbecause of a hardwired tendency to like sugar and fat,\\n\\nespecially when they are combined,\\n\\nwould prefer to eat the cookies versus the radishes.\\n\\nI know that there are some mutants out there\\n\\nthat are saying, I like radishes more than cookies,\\n\\nbut look, most people like cookies more than radishes.\\n\\nThe subjects in these studies are divided into two groups.\\n\\nOne group is told you have to resist eating the radishes.\\n\\nThe other group is told you have\\n\\nto resist eating the cookies.\\n\\nAnd then the subjects are observed\\n\\nduring this time typically,\\n\\nbut this is really not what the experiment is about per se.\\n\\nThis stage of the experiment is really designed\\n\\nto get people to resist a certain kind of behavior.\\n\\nAnd the assumption, again, this is an assumption\\n\\nbecause there's no brain recordings here.\\n\\nNo one's in an MRI machine looking\\n\\nat what brain areas are activated or not activated.\\n\\nThere's no cortisol being measured,\\n\\nat least not in these early experiments.\\n\\nThese people are either resisting something\\n\\nthat's pretty easy to resist, radishes,\\n\\nor they are being asked to resist something\\n\\nthat for most people is going to be harder\\n\\nto resist than resisting radishes,\\n\\nwhich is resisting freshly baked cookies.\\n\\nAnd that challenge has been made even more difficult\\n\\nby the wafting aromas of freshly baked cookies in the room.\\n\\nAnd in some cases has been made even more difficult\\n\\nbecause these people are dieting.\\n\\nAnd keep in mind that when you calorie restrict\\n\\nor when you put yourself on a diet of any kind,\\n\\nthere is a well-established mechanism in the brain\\n\\nby which the neurons that engage hunger,\\n\\nespecially hunger for fat and sugar,\\n\\nand that respond to things like aromas and tastes\\n\\nare heightened.\\n\\nThat is their activity levels are heightened,\\n\\nwhich means that things that smell really good,\\n\\nsmell really, really good when you're hungry.\\n\\nThings that ordinarily would taste really good,\\n\\ntaste really, really, really good\\n\\nwhen you finally eat them.\\n\\nSo the key component of this stage of the experiment\\n\\nis to engage people's willpower.\\n\\nThe second part of the experiment has all of the subjects\\n\\nseparately engage in another challenging task.\\n\\nAnd the challenging task that they are asked to engage in\\n\\nis to solve a particular puzzle.\\n\\nAnd again, different experiments use different puzzles,\\n\\ndifferent experiments use different contexts,\\n\\nbut the original experiments\\n\\nthat Baumeister and colleagues did\\n\\nhad people try and solve a puzzle that could not be solved.\\n\\nSo it's very, very difficult.\\n\\nIn fact, it's impossible,\\n\\nbut the subjects weren't aware of that.\\n\\nAnd then what was measured was how long subjects persisted\\n\\nin trying to solve this impossible to solve puzzle,\\n\\ndepending on whether or not previously\\n\\nthey had to resist the radishes,\\n\\nwhich is pretty easy to resist,\\n\\nor resist the cookies, which is at least harder to resist.\\n\\nAnd for some people would be very, very hard to resist.\\n\\nNow you can probably already guess what the outcome of this\\n\\nand similar studies was,\\n\\nbecause it birthed this entire belief camp\\n\\nwithin the field of psychology\\n\\nthat willpower is a limited resource.\\n\\nThe outcome was that if people had to resist the cookies,\\n\\nwhich is harder to do than resisting the radishes,\\n\\nthat they would persist for less time\\n\\nwhen they had to try and solve a puzzle\\n\\nthat unbeknownst to them could not be solved.\\n\\nConversely, if people had to resist something\\n\\nthat was pretty easy to resist,\\n\\nsuch as resisting eating radishes,\\n\\nsomething that for me would be very, very easy to resist.\\n\\nWell, when they were subsequently faced\\n\\nwith trying to solve a very difficult,\\n\\nindeed impossible to solve puzzle,\\n\\nthey persisted much longer.\\n\\nOkay, so put very simply,\\n\\nthis study concluded that if you have to resist one thing\\n\\nand it's a hard thing to resist,\\n\\nwell, then you have less air quotes here,\\n\\nresistance in you willpower\\n\\nto engage in another difficult task subsequently.\\n\\nWhereas if you had an easy challenge just prior\\n\\nor no challenge just prior to being faced with a challenge\\n\\nsuch as a very difficult puzzle,\\n\\nwell, then you had more resource,\\n\\nmore willpower to apply to the solving of that puzzle.\\n\\nSo the conclusion that Baumeister and colleagues drew\\n\\nfrom those results was that willpower is a limited resource,\\n\\nbut it didn't specify,\\n\\nnor did they specify exactly what that limited resource is.\\n\\nAnd this was quite an attractive theory\\n\\nbecause it jived well with most people's perception\\n\\nof what willpower and tenacity was for them.\\n\\nThis idea that, yes, there are things that challenge us,\\n\\nboth to do and to resist, but that we can do that.\\n\\nBut when we are asked to do that again and again and again,\\n\\nwhile we may build up some capacity\\n\\nto engage our willpower and tenacity,\\n\\nand of course there are those rare individuals\\n\\nthat we've heard about and some of us know\\n\\nthat seem to have just a kind of bottomless reservoir\\n\\nof willpower and tenacity,\\n\\nmost of us have an intuitive understanding\\n\\nof how hard it is to constantly be in friction with life,\\n\\nto constantly have to push ourselves\\n\\nto do things and to resist things.\\n\\nAnd that while that capacity can expand and grow\\n\\nand we can get better at it,\\n\\nthat there does seem to be something here,\\n\\njust subjectively speaking,\\n\\nthere does seem to be something about engaging tenacity\\n\\nand willpower that, yeah, it can feel good,\\n\\nbut it also requires effort,\\n\\nthis neural energy that we were talking about.\\n\\nSo that raised the question of, okay,\\n\\nif willpower is a limited resource,\\n\\nwhat exactly is that resource at a physiological level?\\n\\nSo Baumeister and colleagues subsequently went on\\n\\nto explore what I think is a really interesting\\n\\nand clever idea.\\n\\nFrankly, I can't confess\\n\\nthat I would have thought of this, but they did.\\n\\nThey said, okay, in some cases,\\n\\npeople are eating the cookie\\n\\nand then they're engaging in this very difficult puzzle.\\n\\nIn other cases, they're eating the radish\\n\\nand engaging in this difficult puzzle.\\n\\nAnd of course, other experiments\\n\\nused non-food challenging choices,\\n\\nbut they came up with an idea,\\n\\nwhich was the brain as one of the most metabolically active\\n\\norgans in our entire body,\\n\\nif not the most metabolically active organ\\n\\nin our entire body, requires a lot of fuel.\\n\\nIt requires a lot of glucose.\\n\\nNow, of course, the brain mainly runs on glucose,\\n\\nbut if you're following a ketogenic diet,\\n\\nyour brain will mainly run on ketones.\\n\\nBut for most people who are omnivores\\n\\nor eating carbohydrates,\\n\\nglucose is the main and preferred fuel source for neurons,\\n\\nfor nerve cells in your brain and body for that matter.\\n\\nBaumeister and colleagues raised the hypothesis\\n\\nthat perhaps glucose availability itself\\n\\nis the resource that's limiting willpower.\\n\\nAnd in a whole set of experiments,\\n\\nthey really showed that if people are asked\\n\\nto do a difficult task, to engage their willpower,\\n\\nand this could be done by resisting a particular behavior\\n\\nor by engaging in a particular behavior.\\n\\nI'll just give you an example\\n\\nof engaging in a particular behavior\\n\\nthat requires willpower or at least focus and mental energy\\n\\nto contrast it with the resisting radishes\\n\\nversus resisting cookies example that I gave earlier.\\n\\nOne common practice within experiments like this\\n\\nis to give people a very long passage of words.\\n\\nSo it's a story.\\n\\nAnd then to give them some sort of rule\\n\\nabout how to edit that passage.\\n\\nMaybe they have to cross out every third E\\n\\nor the E's that arrive in the middle of sentences\\n\\nnext to consonants, but not other vowels.\\n\\nYou know, stuff that takes a lot of energy.\\n\\nSo these are do's as opposed to resisting behaviors\\n\\nlike we were talking about earlier,\\n\\nresisting the radish, resisting the cookies.\\n\\nAlthough in many of these experiments,\\n\\nthere's a command to do something,\\n\\nyou know, cross out certain letter E's in this passage,\\n\\nbut also to resist the reflex to cross out other E's.\\n\\nAnd of course, all of this is under time pressure.\\n\\nAnd oftentimes it's being rewarded or scored.\\n\\nThis is the way that psychology researchers\\n\\nget people to engage in particular experiments\\n\\nand behaviors and resist certain things\\n\\nin the context of a laboratory environment\\n\\nwhen those things frankly are kind of boring\\n\\nand meaningless, they'll pay you more\\n\\nif you do well at the task, they'll give you money\\n\\nand then subtract the money that you're going to get\\n\\nat the end of the experiment,\\n\\nif you make errors and things like that,\\n\\nand they'll do it under time constraint,\\n\\nas I mentioned earlier.\\n\\nSo there were lots of different conditions for,\\n\\nagain, here air quotes,\\n\\ndraining people's willpower and tenacity\\n\\nand certainly draining their mental attention.\\n\\nAnd then they would have them do another subsequent task.\\n\\nSo in many ways, this just mirrors\\n\\nthe first cookie radish experiment\\n\\ndone by Baumeister and colleagues.\\n\\nBut there was an important intervention\\n\\nput between the first and the second hard task.\\n\\nAnd that intervention was to give one group\\n\\na glucose beverage of about 150 calories or so.\\n\\nSo they would drink a glucose beverage\\n\\nto increase levels of blood glucose,\\n\\nthe preferred fuel source for the brain,\\n\\nversus giving them an artificially flavored drink\\n\\nor just water or something that was, of course,\\n\\nmatched for flavor,\\n\\nbut that did not contain any glucose or calories.\\n\\nNow, this is a clever experimental design,\\n\\nif you think about it,\\n\\nbecause at least at a first glance,\\n\\nthe only thing that really seems to be different\\n\\nis the availability of glucose for the brain.\\n\\nAnd you can probably guess\\n\\nwhat the outcome of these studies was.\\n\\nThe outcome of these studies was\\n\\nthat when subjects are given glucose\\n\\nin between a first hard task that required willpower\\n\\nand a second hard task that required willpower,\\n\\nand in some experiments,\\n\\na third hard task that required willpower,\\n\\nthat their levels of willpower were maintained consistently\\n\\nfrom one task to the next,\\n\\nand in some cases increased from one task to the next\\n\\nif they had more glucose available\\n\\nbecause they drank this glucose drink.\\n\\nSo what's really interesting and frankly,\\n\\nreally nice about these studies\\n\\nis that they attempted to bridge a psychological construct\\n\\nlike tenacity and willpower,\\n\\nand to test the argument that willpower\\n\\nis an expendable resource,\\n\\nand yet it's an expendable resource that is replenishable\\n\\nby linking that to a physiological variable,\\n\\nand the physiological variable they linked it to\\n\\nwas glucose availability in the brain.\\n\\nNow, this set the field of psychology,\\n\\nand in fact, the field of pop psychology,\\n\\nthat is the discussion about formal findings\\n\\nin the field of formal psychological research ablaze.\\n\\nPeople were so excited about this.\\n\\nI mean, this set of findings really pointed to the argument\\n\\nthat if you could just keep levels\\n\\nof brain glucose elevated across your day,\\n\\nor at least stable across the day,\\n\\nthat you would have more willpower and tenacity,\\n\\nthis thing that humans have been seeking more of\\n\\nsince the beginning of time.\\n\\nNow, all of that seemed fine and good,\\n\\nand in fact, a lot of products and courses\\n\\nwere born out of that literature.\\n\\nPeople were arguing that you should sip on a glucose drink\\n\\nwhile doing any kind of hard task,\\n\\nthat you should sip on glucose drinks between tasks,\\n\\nthat you should be thinking about literally\\n\\nfuel that you ingest into your body\\n\\nas fuel for psychological processes within your brain\\n\\nthat would allow you to perform better in work,\\n\\nin school, in athletics, in relationships,\\n\\nin all of the domains of life.\\n\\nBut of course, any time there is a prominence\\n\\nor a real excitement about a particular finding\\n\\nin any field of science, but in particular in psychology\\n\\nwhere it feels so applicable,\\n\\nas did the Baumeister results,\\n\\nyou are going to get other groups\\n\\nthat are going to try and replicate those findings\\n\\nand that are going to dig into the findings themselves\\n\\nand look at the statistics, look at how well\\n\\nor poorly powered those studies were.\\n\\nWe don't want to get into a full discussion\\n\\nabout powering studies right now,\\n\\nbut powering studies has a lot to do\\n\\nwith addressing the question of whether or not\\n\\nthere were enough subjects in the study\\n\\nto really draw the conclusions that one drew\\n\\nor whether or not the statistics fell out as,\\n\\nyes, there was a significant effect of glucose ingestion\\n\\non willpower and tenacity,\\n\\nbut if there weren't enough subjects,\\n\\nwell, then there are other variables\\n\\nthat could potentially explain those results.\\n\\nSo there were a lot of meta-analyses and other studies\\n\\ntrying to replicate the work of Baumeister\\n\\nand that's where things got controversial.\\n\\nNow we can take a step back from all of that controversy.\\n\\nAfter all, we don't want to spend too much time\\n\\non the controversy itself.\\n\\nRather, we want to know what the counter interpretation\\n\\nof the Baumeister results was.\\n\\nAnd I want to be very clear.\\n\\nThere was no real dispute as to whether or not Baumeister\\n\\ngot the results that he and his colleagues\\n\\nclaimed to have obtained.\\n\\nThey did get those results.\\n\\nThe question really was about the interpretation.\\n\\nIs willpower a limited resource?\\n\\nAnd if it is, is the physiological resource itself\\n\\nglucose availability to the brain?\\n\\nSo in 2013, a colleague of mine at Stanford, Dr. Carol Dweck\\n\\nin our department of psychology,\\n\\ndid a study in which she examined this idea\\n\\nthat willpower is a limited resource\\n\\nand the idea that the resource that's limited\\n\\nis glucose availability for the brain.\\n\\nSo Dweck and colleagues did an experiment\\n\\nthat in many ways mirrored the overall organization\\n\\nof the experiments done by Baumeister and colleagues.\\n\\nThere was a difficult task.\\n\\nIn some cases, the difficult task was that crossing out\\n\\na particular ease within a passage task\\n\\nfollowed by another difficult task.\\n\\nAnd the difficult task that came second was the Stroop task.\\n\\nThis is a task I've talked about before on this podcast,\\n\\nalthough some episodes ago,\\n\\nso for those of you that are not familiar\\n\\nwith the Stroop task, the Stroop task\\n\\nis where subjects are presented\\n\\nwith words in different colors\\n\\nand they are instructed to either read the word,\\n\\nso to pay attention to the content of the word\\n\\nor to the color in which the font of the word is written.\\n\\nThis might seem pretty easy to most of you, right?\\n\\nIf I put up a card that says apple on it\\n\\nand apple is written in green,\\n\\nyou probably wouldn't have a hard time\\n\\nif you had been instructed to tell me\\n\\nwhat color is the word written in\\n\\nfor you to just say green, okay?\\n\\nBut if I were to hold up a card that said red,\\n\\nbut the font is actually in the color green,\\n\\nit's a little bit harder.\\n\\nAnd if I were to then do that for 100 cards or 300 cards\\n\\nand put you under time pressure\\n\\nwhere you're losing money that you're sure to get\\n\\nif you make mistakes or you will earn money\\n\\nat the end of the experiment, if you get answers correctly,\\n\\nwell, then you start making more mistakes.\\n\\nThat's just the way these experiments work.\\n\\nSo they did a variation on the Stroop task\\n\\nthat isn't exactly the way I just described it.\\n\\nAnd the Stroop task, by the way,\\n\\nis one that's used to probe prefrontal cortex function,\\n\\nthis area of our brain right behind our foreheads\\n\\nthat is responsible for many things,\\n\\nbut in part is responsible for context and strategy setting\\n\\ngiven a particular set of rules.\\n\\nSo if you get onto the bus or get onto the subway\\n\\nversus walk into a black tie dinner,\\n\\nthe context and rules are very, very different\\n\\nas to what you would say or not say,\\n\\nhow you behave, how you address.\\n\\nYour prefrontal cortex is largely, although not entirely,\\n\\nis largely responsible for a lot of the context setting\\n\\nand rule setting from one situation to the next.\\n\\nAnd if you think about the Stroop task,\\n\\nit's really just a context dependent strategy task.\\n\\nYou either have to pay attention to the meaning of the words\\n\\nor the colors in which those words are written.\\n\\nAnd the number of mistakes that you'll make\\n\\ndepends on how much time pressure you're under,\\n\\nwhat sorts of neurologic or psychiatric challenges\\n\\nyou might be facing or not facing, so on and so forth.\\n\\nBut it's a very robust task that's existed\\n\\nin the scientific literature for a long period of time.\\n\\nSo the Dweck experiment, and by the way,\\n\\nthere were actually three experiments in this paper.\\n\\nI won't go through all of them in detail for sake of time,\\n\\nbut I will provide a link to the paper\\n\\nin the show note captions.\\n\\nBut the major focus of the study\\n\\nwas to have people engage in one hard task\\n\\nand then in another hard task,\\n\\nboth of which draw on willpower,\\n\\ntesting the idea that willpower is a limited resource\\n\\nand then providing some of those subjects\\n\\nwith a glucose-rich drink\\n\\nor other subjects with a drink\\n\\nthat was artificially sweetened.\\n\\nSo it had no glucose, no calories, but tasted.\\n\\nYes, they matched them for taste.\\n\\nI know some of you who don't like artificial sweeteners\\n\\nare saying those don't taste exactly like real sugar,\\n\\nbut they managed to match these drinks for taste.\\n\\nBut in one case, the drink would clearly\\n\\nincrease blood glucose.\\n\\nIn the other case, the drink would not raise blood glucose.\\n\\nSo the results of this study are really spectacular\\n\\nin my mind, because what this study found was that,\\n\\nyes, indeed, ingesting glucose can improve performance\\n\\non these multiple challenging willpower-requiring tasks.\\n\\nHowever, the degree to which the glucose-containing drink\\n\\ncould improve performance\\n\\ndepended on whether or not you believed\\n\\nthat willpower was a limited resource\\n\\nand whether or not you believe that resource was glucose.\\n\\nIn other words, if you hear and believe\\n\\nthat willpower is a limited resource,\\n\\nwell then, indeed, with each subsequent task\\n\\nthat you engage in or life event of any kind\\n\\nthat you engage in that requires willpower and tenacity,\\n\\nyou will have less willpower and tenacity to draw on.\\n\\nWhereas if you believe that willpower and tenacity\\n\\nare unlimited and, in fact, are divorced from blood glucose\\n\\nas the physiological source of willpower and tenacity,\\n\\nwell, then you can engage in one challenging task\\n\\nand another challenging task and another challenging task\\n\\nwithout any diminishment in performance.\\n\\nNow that, of course, leaves us all in a very tough position\\n\\nbecause how are we to decide what to believe\\n\\nif we know that willpower can be a limited resource\\n\\nor willpower cannot be a limited resource?\\n\\nAh, well, the results of the DWEK study,\\n\\nand by the way, I should share with you\\n\\nthe title of the study.\\n\\nThe title of the study, not surprisingly,\\n\\nis Beliefs About Willpower Determine the Impact\\n\\nof Glucose on Self-Control.\\n\\nAnd this was a study published in the Proceedings\\n\\nof the National Academy of Sciences.\\n\\nAgain, I'll provide a link to this study\\n\\nin the show note captions.\\n\\nThere are three major experiments in this study,\\n\\nas I mentioned before.\\n\\nI just gave you the major conclusion of all of them,\\n\\nsort of woven together.\\n\\nAnd if it wasn't clear already,\\n\\nthe major conclusions are that, yes,\\n\\ningesting glucose can improve your ability\\n\\nto engage tenacity and willpower,\\n\\naka self-control, from one task to the next,\\n\\nprovided that you believe that glucose\\n\\nis the limiting resource\\n\\nfor engaging tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nIf you don't believe that,\\n\\nwell, then you can engage tenacity and willpower\\n\\nwithout ingesting glucose.\\n\\nAnd that's where the artificially flavored drink comes in.\\n\\nI'll leave it to you to kind of unpack\\n\\nwhat that means experimentally,\\n\\nbut it's a very clever experimental design\\n\\nthat DWEK and colleagues came up with,\\n\\nbecause it argues that, yes, indeed,\\n\\nit's hard to do a challenging thing\\n\\nright after another challenging thing,\\n\\nbut there's no reason to think\\n\\nthat you can't do both of those things\\n\\nwhile engaging the utmost tenacity and willpower\\n\\nif you believe that tenacity and willpower\\n\\nexists within you as a single mechanism\\n\\nthat can be harnessed,\\n\\nand that it's not a single mechanism\\n\\nthat has a reservoir that runs down\\n\\nas you engage in one hard thing to the next.\\n\\nNow, this is very important\\n\\nbecause we are about to transition into our discussion\\n\\nof the physiological, that is the neural underpinnings\\n\\nof tenacity and willpower,\\n\\nwhich as it turns out is one major set of brain circuits.\\n\\nNow, there could be others that are yet to be discovered,\\n\\nbut we know that there is one major set of brain circuits\\n\\nin particular one brain area, believe it or not,\\n\\nthat an entire collection of more than two dozen studies\\n\\nreally points to as the seat,\\n\\nthe origin of what we call tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nBut before we transition to that\\n\\nand the tools and protocols\\n\\nthat that physiological neural understanding\\n\\nset forth for us to all use and apply,\\n\\nI'd be remiss if I didn't mention that Baumeister\\n\\nwasn't about to hear these results from Dweck and colleagues\\n\\nand just say, okay, willpower is not a limited resource.\\n\\nIt's not blood glucose.\\n\\nIt's all what you believe about willpower.\\n\\nIt's all what you believe about blood glucose.\\n\\nRather, Baumeister himself went back to the lab\\n\\nand did subsequent experiments\\n\\nthat in some ways not all counter the Dweck results.\\n\\nSo I'm not trying to confuse anybody,\\n\\nbut I wouldn't be doing my job\\n\\nif I didn't give you both sides of the story.\\n\\nNow, the good news is that the tools and protocols\\n\\nthat we are going to arrive at work\\n\\nregardless of which psychological camp\\n\\nyou happen to be in, the Baumeister camp or the Dweck camp.\\n\\nNow, I don't want to give the impression\\n\\nthat these are warring camps.\\n\\nAnd I also don't want to give the impression\\n\\nthat these are the only two camps of thought\\n\\nand experimentation within the field\\n\\nof tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nThere are many groups working on these subjects.\\n\\nIndeed, there have been meta-analyses\\n\\nthat have confirmed the major theories of Baumeister\\n\\nand there are meta-analyses that have refuted\\n\\nthe major findings of Baumeister.\\n\\nI will provide links in the show note captions\\n\\nto a couple examples of each\\n\\nso that you have those to peruse if you like.\\n\\nBut let's discuss for a moment what Baumeister found\\n\\nwhen they went back and re-researched,\\n\\nI think that's a word, re-researched the idea\\n\\nthat willpower is a limited resource\\n\\nand that glucose is that limiting resource.\\n\\nBaumeister and colleagues looked at the Dweck data\\n\\nand said, okay, fine, the data looked great\\n\\nexcept for the fact that in real life\\n\\nand in many previous experiments\\n\\nthat they and others had done,\\n\\nit wasn't just two hard challenges back to back\\n\\nbut often two or three or four.\\n\\nAnd what Baumeister and others found\\n\\nwas that when subjects are presented\\n\\nnot with just two challenges back to back\\n\\nbut three or more challenges,\\n\\nso back to back to back to back,\\n\\nchallenges that have to engage a lot of neural energy,\\n\\na lot of willpower, tenacity,\\n\\nresistance to do certain things\\n\\nand effort to engage in certain kinds of behaviors\\n\\nand cognitive processes\\n\\nthat when subjects had glucose available to them\\n\\nin the brain by way of ingesting these glucose drinks,\\n\\nsipping those in between the tasks,\\n\\nsometimes even during the tasks,\\n\\nthat their performance, that is their willpower\\n\\nand tenacity to engage in challenges\\n\\nwas maintained across those multiple challenges.\\n\\nAnd they conceded that one's belief about willpower\\n\\ncould indeed dictate whether or not willpower\\n\\nwas or was not a limited resource\\n\\nand whether glucose would or would not\\n\\nenhance one's ability to engage willpower.\\n\\nBut they argued that if one confronts\\n\\nmultiple challenging circumstances,\\n\\nas is very naturalistic as we say,\\n\\nit's very typical of everyday real life,\\n\\nthen the availability of glucose during and between tasks,\\n\\nthe ability for the brain to engage\\n\\nin its external environment\\n\\nand take reads of its internal environment,\\n\\nhow we feel inside relative to what's expected of us\\n\\nwas very valuable in allowing people to engage this thing\\n\\nthat psychologically we describe as tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nI'd like to just take a brief break\\n\\nand thank one of our sponsors, which is Element.\\n\\nElement is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need\\n\\nand nothing you don't.\\n\\nThat means plenty of salt, sodium, magnesium and potassium,\\n\\nthe so-called electrolytes and no sugar.\\n\\nSalt, magnesium and potassium are critical\\n\\nto the function of all the cells in your body,\\n\\nin particular to the function of your nerve cells,\\n\\nalso called neurons.\\n\\nNow people of course have varying levels\\n\\nof requirements for sodium.\\n\\nSo people with hypertension or pre-hypertension\\n\\nprobably shouldn't increase their sodium.\\n\\nHowever, many people are surprised to find\\n\\nthat by increasing their sodium intake,\\n\\nthey are able to function better cognitively and physically.\\n\\nAnd that's because a lot of people,\\n\\nespecially people who are following low carbohydrate\\n\\nor even moderate carbohydrate and really clean diets,\\n\\noftentimes they're excreting a lot of water\\n\\nand electrolytes along with it.\\n\\nAnd simply by increasing their electrolyte intake\\n\\nusing Element, they just feel better and function better.\\n\\nI typically drink Element first thing in the morning\\n\\nwhen I wake up in order to hydrate my body\\n\\nand make sure I have enough electrolytes.\\n\\nAnd while I do any kind of physical training,\\n\\nand certainly I drink Element in my water\\n\\nwhen I'm in the sauna and after going in the sauna\\n\\nbecause that causes quite a lot of sweating.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement.\\n\\nThat's lmnt.com slash Huberman\\n\\nto claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.\\n\\nAgain, that's drinkelementlmnt.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nLet's talk about the physiology of tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nAnd I assure you that the conversation\\n\\nwe are about to have is not going to be\\n\\njust a bunch of nomenclature and mechanistic understanding\\n\\nof the origins of tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nRather, it argues that tenacity and willpower\\n\\nhave a unified source.\\n\\nThat is a specific set of brain areas\\n\\nthat when active engage that feeling of tenacity\\n\\nand willpower regardless of what we are confronted with,\\n\\nregardless of whether or not we are trying to engage\\n\\nin something that reflexively we wouldn't otherwise\\n\\nwant to engage in.\\n\\nAnd regardless of whether or not we are confronted\\n\\nwith something that we have to resist.\\n\\nAnd to me, that's extremely reassuring\\n\\nbecause whether or not you believe that blood glucose\\n\\nis the limiting resource for willpower,\\n\\nwhether or not you believe that your beliefs about willpower\\n\\nand blood glucose impact your level of willpower,\\n\\nwhat we know for sure is that there's a single set\\n\\nof brain circuits.\\n\\nIndeed, there's a single brain area\\n\\nthat seems to be able to largely, if not entirely explain\\n\\nthis phenomenon that we call tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nAnd that should be reassuring because what it means\\n\\nis that tenacity and willpower is the reflection\\n\\nof a neural circuit function that is a skill.\\n\\nIt's an expression of something that we all have within us.\\n\\nWe all have this particular brain area.\\n\\nAnd quite excitingly, this is the third point,\\n\\nthis brain area is highly subject to plasticity.\\n\\nThere are specific things that we can do\\n\\nand there are specific mindsets that we can adopt\\n\\nthat allow us to increase the activity\\n\\nof this particular brain area.\\n\\nIndeed, to increase the size of this particular brain area\\n\\nso that we can call on tenacity and willpower,\\n\\nnot just in one circumstance like school\\n\\nor musical learning or athletic endeavors\\n\\nor relationship endeavors,\\n\\nbut rather that we can call on this brain area\\n\\nin the context of any and all circumstances\\n\\nwhere willpower and tenacity are required.\\n\\nNow we talk about neuroscience a lot on this podcast,\\n\\nbut it's not often that I point to a particular brain area\\n\\nand can confidently say this particular brain area\\n\\nhas an absolutely integral role in something\\n\\nas kind of high level psychological as tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nBut today we can do that.\\n\\nAnd that's because there's a collection\\n\\nof more than two dozen studies\\n\\nthat point to one particular brain area.\\n\\nAnd of course it's connections with other brain areas\\n\\nbecause no single brain area operates in isolation.\\n\\nEvery brain area is operating\\n\\nin the context of neural circuits,\\n\\nother brain areas that it receives inputs from\\n\\nand gives inputs to and so on.\\n\\nBut this one particular brain area\\n\\nreally does seem to underlie\\n\\nwhat we call tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nAnd we know that through several lines of evidence.\\n\\nFirst of all, I'll tell you the name of the brain area,\\n\\nalthough the name itself isn't going to tell you much\\n\\nunless you're a neuroscientist or an anatomist.\\n\\nSo I'll give a little bit of background about it.\\n\\nThe name of the brain area\\n\\nis the anterior mid cingulate cortex.\\n\\nThe anterior mid cingulate cortex\\n\\nis part of a larger brain area called the cingulate cortex.\\n\\nAnd in humans versus animals,\\n\\nit goes by slightly different names, unfortunately.\\n\\nIt's just one of the consequences\\n\\nof different researchers in different labs\\n\\ncalling the same thing different things.\\n\\nIt'd be really frustrating, but we'll make it very simple\\n\\nbecause today we were referred to this area\\n\\nas the anterior mid cingulate cortex,\\n\\nwhich is a subdivision of a larger brain area\\n\\nsimply called the cingulate cortex.\\n\\nThe anterior mid cingulate cortex\\n\\nresides in the frontal lobes.\\n\\nSo it's behind your forehead,\\n\\nalthough that doesn't tell you anything\\n\\nbecause all of your brain is behind your forehead\\n\\nif you think about it.\\n\\nAnd it's about a third of the way back\\n\\ntoward the back of your head.\\n\\nAnd you actually have two of these structures,\\n\\ntwo anterior mid cingulate cortices,\\n\\none on each side of the brain.\\n\\nAnd they receive a lot of inputs\\n\\nfrom a lot of different areas.\\n\\nAnd we'll talk about what those areas are\\n\\nbecause this is extremely important\\n\\nwhen thinking about the different psychological\\n\\nand physiological resources that you can draw upon\\n\\nto engage tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nBut for the time being,\\n\\nlet me just go through the evidence\\n\\nand kind of list format of why we feel so confident\\n\\nthat the anterior mid cingulate cortex\\n\\nis such a vital hub for engaging tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nFor each of these points that I'm about to make,\\n\\nthere is indeed at least one,\\n\\nif not several quality peer reviewed studies in humans.\\n\\nSo there's a lot of data from animals,\\n\\nboth rodents and primate models, et cetera,\\n\\nthat we're not talking about today,\\n\\nbut I should mention all of which supports\\n\\nthe human data and vice versa.\\n\\nThe data I'm going to describe now come from humans\\n\\nand from a variety of different types of studies.\\n\\nSo there are a lot of different ways\\n\\nthat one can consider if a brain area is implicated\\n\\nin a given psychological or physiological phenomenon\\n\\nlike motivation or sadness or visual perception.\\n\\nAnd those include, for instance,\\n\\nif a brain area is active during a given phenomenon.\\n\\nSo one way to explore this is to put\\n\\nliterally wire electrodes down below the skull,\\n\\nrecord the electric activity of neurons\\n\\nand assess whether or not the electrical activity\\n\\nof those neurons changes when a person is, say,\\n\\nviewing faces or feeling a particular way,\\n\\nlike feeling tenacious or feeling bored\\n\\nor feeling aggressive and so on.\\n\\nAnother way of assessing a particular brain area's role\\n\\nin a given physiological or psychological phenomenon\\n\\nis in individuals where that particular brain area\\n\\nis injured, you might expect that a particular phenomenon\\n\\nlike willpower, like the ability to perceive faces,\\n\\nis present or absent, whether or not it's exacerbated\\n\\nor whether or not it's diminished.\\n\\nOther ways of assessing whether or not a given brain area\\n\\nis involved in a given phenomenon\\n\\nis whether or not that brain area literally changes size,\\n\\nwhether or not it changes in volume\\n\\nover the course of some sort of training.\\n\\nSo for instance, if somebody is not able\\n\\nto play a musical instrument, such as myself,\\n\\nand then I or a subject in one of these experiments\\n\\nlearns a musical instrument and the volume,\\n\\nthe size of the particular brain area is assessed\\n\\nacross the learning or simply before and after\\n\\nthat musical learning, and it grows,\\n\\nor perhaps even if it shrinks or changes shape,\\n\\none might determine that it is somehow involved\\n\\nin the process of learning a musical instrument.\\n\\nYou couldn't unequivocally conclude that,\\n\\nbut along with other types of evidence,\\n\\none could perhaps conclude that.\\n\\nSo that's just a partial list of ways\\n\\nto assess brain area function.\\n\\nOther ways include assessing what other areas\\n\\na given brain area gets input from.\\n\\nSo for instance, in the case of the anterior\\n\\nmid-singulate cortex, we will soon discuss the fact\\n\\nthat it gets robust input from the autonomic nervous system,\\n\\nwhich you already learned about.\\n\\nIt gets robust input from reward systems of the brain,\\n\\nsuch as the dopamine and serotonin-based reward systems\\n\\nof the brain, and it gets robust input from the context\\n\\nand strategy setting areas of the brain as well,\\n\\nand many other different brain areas.\\n\\nSo there's a structural logic\\n\\nas to why the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nwould be involved in tenacity and willpower,\\n\\nbut no single anatomical or physiological\\n\\nor lesion-based finding is as compelling\\n\\nas when we consider all of the results\\n\\nabout the anterior mid-singulate cortex together\\n\\nand side by side.\\n\\nSo for instance, recordings by neural imaging\\n\\nof the anterior mid-singulate cortex in an unbiased way,\\n\\nmeaning people are put into a brain scanner\\n\\nand brain activity is examined en masse.\\n\\nAll of the brain areas are looked at\\n\\nand people are presented with either a hard task\\n\\nor an easy task, revealed that the anterior\\n\\nmid-singulate cortex shows elevated levels of activity\\n\\nin the hard versus the easy task.\\n\\nAnd again, I want to point out\\n\\nthat the researchers were not looking for that result.\\n\\nThey simply observed that result.\\n\\nIn addition, if people who exhibit high levels\\n\\nof academic performance across many different subjects\\n\\nare put into a brain scanner that evaluates\\n\\nso-called resting state connectivity, so no task,\\n\\nbut simply levels of activity in different brain areas\\n\\nthat occur spontaneously.\\n\\nSo they're just sitting in the scanner,\\n\\nlooking at a blank screen.\\n\\nThe resting or spontaneous levels of activity\\n\\nin the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nof high achieving individuals is higher\\n\\nrelative to those of lower achieving individuals.\\n\\nIn addition, people that have lesions\\n\\nor disruptions of anterior mid-singulate cortical function\\n\\nshow increased apathy and depression\\n\\nand reduced levels of tenacity\\n\\nand motivation across the board,\\n\\nregardless of what domain of life one is asking about,\\n\\nwhether or not it's athletic or academic, et cetera.\\n\\nIndeed, successful dieters show elevated spontaneous\\n\\nand what's called evoked levels of activity\\n\\nin the anterior mid-singulate cortex.\\n\\nSo spontaneous, again, just at rest,\\n\\nthey have higher levels of activity\\n\\nin the anterior mid-singulate cortex.\\n\\nAnd for those that are presented with food\\n\\nand they have to resist that food\\n\\nand they have to resist the smell of that food\\n\\nand the potential taste of that food,\\n\\nthe activity of the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\ngoes up even further,\\n\\nespecially in those individuals who can resist,\\n\\nthat is who can engage willpower\\n\\nto not eat the delicious food item.\\n\\nConversely, individuals that have failed\\n\\nto exert sufficient willpower to lose their desired weight,\\n\\nand this was for medical reasons\\n\\nrelated to trying to achieve medical health,\\n\\nas well as people who are obese\\n\\nseem to have diminished levels of activity\\n\\nin the anterior mid-singulate cortex.\\n\\nIn addition, people who are depressed,\\n\\nwho express a lot of apathy,\\n\\nand here we're talking about clinically diagnosed\\n\\nmajor depression, show reduced levels of activity\\n\\nin the anterior mid-singulate cortex.\\n\\nHumans that express a lot of what's called\\n\\nlearned helplessness, that is they've adopted the belief\\n\\nand the actions associated with the belief\\n\\nthat no matter what they do,\\n\\nthe outcomes are not going to be what they desire,\\n\\nexpressed lower levels of neural activity\\n\\nin the anterior mid-singulate cortex.\\n\\nSo you can see this list goes on and on,\\n\\nbut it in fact gets even more interesting.\\n\\nRemember earlier, I mentioned that successful dieters\\n\\nhave elevated levels of neural activity\\n\\nin the anterior mid-singulate cortex.\\n\\nNow that might seem like a good thing,\\n\\nand indeed it can be a good thing,\\n\\nbut there's a pathologic condition associated with dieting\\n\\nand one's ability to engage willpower and resist food,\\n\\nand that's in the case of eating disorders\\n\\nsuch as anorexia nervosa.\\n\\nNow I've done a Huberman Lab podcast solo episode\\n\\nabout anorexia nervosa, and on that podcast,\\n\\nI made the point that I'll make again now,\\n\\nwhich is that anorexia nervosa is the most deadly\\n\\nof all the psychiatric conditions,\\n\\nleading to death in a very large percentage\\n\\nof people that have it.\\n\\nNow, fortunately there are treatments\\n\\nand more emerging all the time,\\n\\nbut it's a very serious psychological\\n\\nand physiological condition that is extremely deadly.\\n\\nIndividuals with anorexia nervosa exhibit heightened levels\\n\\nof activity in their anterior mid-singulate cortex,\\n\\nboth at rest and when presented with food.\\n\\nAnd I don't want to go on a full tangent about anorexia\\n\\nbecause we covered anorexia\\n\\non the previous podcast episode about anorexia,\\n\\nwhich by the way, you can find at hubermanlab.com,\\n\\nsimply search anorexia or eating disorders\\n\\nwithin the search function.\\n\\nBut one of the clear symptoms of anorexia nervosa\\n\\nis that the reward pathways of the brain,\\n\\nwhich we know feed into, that is send direct connections\\n\\nto the anterior mid-singulate cortex,\\n\\nseem to be activated under conditions\\n\\nin which people with anorexia avoid food\\n\\nas opposed to eat food.\\n\\nAnd then there's a very interesting and positive literature\\n\\nabout so-called super-agers.\\n\\nSo what we know for sure is that as people age,\\n\\nin particular between the ages of 60 and 90,\\n\\nthere's a reduction in the size of many brain areas,\\n\\nbut the anterior mid-singulate cortex in particular,\\n\\nunless certain things are done to offset that,\\n\\nwe are going to talk about\\n\\nwhat those particular things are in just a few minutes.\\n\\nBut there's a particular category of humans\\n\\nthat's alive now and that live a very long time.\\n\\nThese are the people that stand the greatest chance\\n\\nof becoming centenarians,\\n\\nand many of them are centenarians, so-called super-agers,\\n\\nbut also within the category of super-agers\\n\\nare people who are 60 years old or more,\\n\\nbecause not all of them have reached 80, 90 yet,\\n\\nand have the cognition of 40-year-olds, 30-year-olds,\\n\\nand often even of people in their mid-20s.\\n\\nNow, there are a lot of things that are different\\n\\nabout these super-agers, super-agers in the sense\\n\\nthat they are maintaining very youthful levels of cognition.\\n\\nBut one of the things that's become very apparent\\n\\nfrom the neuroimaging data\\n\\nis that super-agers maintain a volume,\\n\\na size of the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nthat is significantly greater\\n\\nthan their age-matched cohorts.\\n\\nSo the exciting thing is\\n\\nthat there are many, many lines of evidence\\n\\npointing to the fact that the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nat least has something to do\\n\\nwith our ability to generate tenacity and willpower,\\n\\nand that it, when active,\\n\\nmoves us up that continuum away from apathy and depression\\n\\ntoward states of being able to engage in\\n\\nor resist particular types of behaviors.\\n\\nSo what I just described is a bunch of neuroimaging,\\n\\nstructural volume data, blood uptake data,\\n\\nlesion studies, and so on and so forth.\\n\\nBut we can simplify all of that,\\n\\nand in fact, address something\\n\\nthat perhaps I should have said earlier,\\n\\nwhich is that when we were talking about tenacity\\n\\nand willpower, we're really talking about one of two things.\\n\\nWe are either talking about that sense within us\\n\\nthat has us saying, I will, no matter what you tell me,\\n\\nno matter what you put in front of me,\\n\\nno matter what is rolled my way, I will blank.\\n\\nNow, the other expression of tenacity and willpower\\n\\nis that within us, within you, within me,\\n\\nwhen tenacity and willpower are active,\\n\\nwe have that sense within us, that feeling in our body,\\n\\nand that thought pattern, AKA feeling in our brain,\\n\\nthat no matter what you say, no matter what you do,\\n\\nno matter what you put in front of me, I won't.\\n\\nSo really willpower is either an expression of I will,\\n\\nor I absolutely will, is perhaps a better way to state it,\\n\\nor I absolutely won't.\\n\\nNow, that might seem like just a simple subjective\\n\\nreordering of a bunch of physiological data\\n\\nand psychology studies, but it's not.\\n\\nIt's actually far more important for us to understand this,\\n\\nI absolutely will, and I absolutely won't aspect\\n\\nof willpower, because if indeed there is a single brain area\\n\\nthat can govern willpower, and willpower is not one,\\n\\nbut is at least two things, the sense of I absolutely will,\\n\\nno matter what you say, do, et cetera,\\n\\nor I absolutely won't, no matter what you say, do, et cetera,\\n\\nwell, then this brain area can't be a simple switch.\\n\\nIt can't be willpower on, willpower off,\\n\\nwillpower on, willpower off.\\n\\nIt can't be absolute, as we say, it must be graded,\\n\\nit must have levels, so it's more like a slider\\n\\non a light switch than an on versus off light switch.\\n\\nIn addition to that, if there is truly one brain area\\n\\nthat plays a critical role in generating tenacity\\n\\nand willpower, and tenacity and willpower is something\\n\\nthat's required from us in a lot of different contexts\\n\\nwhere we have to say, I absolutely will, yes, this,\\n\\nI absolutely won't know that.\\n\\nI absolutely will also, yes, this, et cetera, et cetera,\\n\\nright, because life is complex.\\n\\nEven just the simple thing of say dieting\\n\\nor trying to get a particular degree\\n\\nor trying to navigate even a simple illness,\\n\\nlike I'm going to get through this week\\n\\ndespite feeling lousy, I'm going to take good care of myself.\\n\\nAll of these things in some sense require tenacity\\n\\nand willpower, and the behaviors we need to engage in\\n\\nand avoid engaging in is very dynamic,\\n\\ndepending not just on who we are\\n\\nand what we're trying to do or not do,\\n\\nbut also where we are that day, that moment.\\n\\nWell, that means that the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nalso needs access to information about context.\\n\\nIt needs to understand what's rewarding or non-rewarding\\n\\nin the context of what we're trying to accomplish,\\n\\nnot just what feels good in the moment.\\n\\nNow, fortunately, there've been a number of studies\\n\\nexploring not just the activity levels\\n\\nof the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nor the size of the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nand the various conditions we talked about before,\\n\\ndepression, obesity, successful dieters,\\n\\nsuccessful students, successful athletes, et cetera,\\n\\nbut a lot of anatomical tracing studies,\\n\\nboth from fixed, that is from dead brain tissue,\\n\\nso post-mortem brain tissue in humans,\\n\\nbut also nowadays there are certain types of neuroimaging,\\n\\nparticular something called diffusion tensor imaging\\n\\nthat allows one to examine the flow of information\\n\\nin and out of different brain areas\\n\\nthrough so-called white matter tracks,\\n\\ntracks meaning T-R-A-C-T-S, tracks.\\n\\nSo these are the wires that connect neurons\\n\\nare called axons and those axons are in sheaths\\n\\nwith a fatty substance called myelin\\n\\nand that in sheathment with myelin allows them\\n\\nto transmit information very quickly.\\n\\nYou'll see where I'm going with all this in just a moment.\\n\\nAnd what we know is that the anterior mid-singulate cortex,\\n\\nagain, of which you have one on each side of the brain,\\n\\nabout a third of the way back from your forehead\\n\\nto the back of your brain approximately,\\n\\nright above the so-called corpus callosum,\\n\\nthis very robust collection of white matter tracks\\n\\nthat connects the two sides of the brain.\\n\\nWell, it gets input and sends input\\n\\nto a number of different brain areas,\\n\\nincluding, but not limited to the following,\\n\\nautonomic centers that control, for instance,\\n\\ncardiovascular function, increases or decreases in heart rate,\\n\\nrespiration, how fast and how deeply you breathe\\n\\nor how shallowly and slowly you breathe,\\n\\nimmune system, inputs and outputs with the spleen,\\n\\nnot directly, but through a couple of different stations\\n\\nwith the very organs in your body\\n\\nthat can release B cells and T cells\\n\\nand immune molecules that can combat bacterial viral\\n\\nand fungal infections and that can repair physical wounds.\\n\\nAnd it communicates with the endocrine system\\n\\nwith the systems of the brain and body\\n\\nthat release, for instance, estrogen and testosterone,\\n\\nwhich by the way are present in both males and females.\\n\\nAnd on a previous episode of the Huberman Lab podcast\\n\\nwith Robert Sapolsky as my guest,\\n\\nwe talked about, for instance, the role of testosterone\\n\\nand many people think,\\n\\noh, testosterone is all about aggression.\\n\\nTestosterone is all about attack.\\n\\nTestosterone is all about mating.\\n\\nThat is completely false.\\n\\nWhile it can be involved in those different processes,\\n\\nwhat Dr. Sapolsky and I discussed\\n\\nis that one of the major functions of testosterone\\n\\nin the brain is to make effort feel good.\\n\\nAnd you can see, and we'll talk a little bit more\\n\\nabout how that links up very directly\\n\\nwith this concept of tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nSo the first point is that the anterior\\n\\nmid-singulate cortex is in direct communication\\n\\nwith all of the areas of the brain\\n\\nand through a couple of other stations,\\n\\nthe body that modulate our sense of tenacity and willpower,\\n\\nwhich we talked about earlier, the need for sleep,\\n\\nthe need for pain or lack of pain\\n\\nor emotional comfort or discomfort\\n\\nto modulate our level of tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nThe anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nis also directly linked up with premotor centers.\\n\\nThese are the centers of the brain\\n\\nthat organize particular patterns of behavior\\n\\nand indeed that can suppress\\n\\nparticular patterns of behavior.\\n\\nAs I tell you that, you're probably filling in the blanks.\\n\\nThis is engaging in a behavior or resisting a behavior.\\n\\nThe anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nis also directly wired in\\n\\nwith the reward pathways of the brain.\\n\\nIt can trigger the release of dopamine.\\n\\nIt can also respond to the release of dopamine\\n\\nand that dopamine release could be generated behaviorally.\\n\\nIt could be generated through some sort of food reward.\\n\\nIt could be pharmacologic.\\n\\nThere are a number of different ways\\n\\nthat the dopamine system can communicate\\n\\nwith the anterior mid-singulate cortex.\\n\\nThe point here is that it is in direct communication\\n\\nwith the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nand the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nis in direct communication with the dopamine system.\\n\\nAnd what I just gave you is frankly just a partial list\\n\\nof the different areas of the brain\\n\\nthat are communicating robustly\\n\\nwith the anterior mid-singulate cortex.\\n\\nIt gets information about interoception,\\n\\nour readout of how we feel in our body.\\n\\nIt also has robust inputs and outputs\\n\\nwith the areas of the brain\\n\\nthat are associated with exteroception,\\n\\nour perception of what is out around us.\\n\\nSo all of that provides a logical basis\\n\\nfor the neuroimaging data, the lesion data,\\n\\nthe volumetric data that we talked about a few minutes ago\\n\\nin the context of depression, anxiety,\\n\\nhigh performance, anorexia and so on.\\n\\nBut one of the most important arguments\\n\\nthat's ever been made in favor\\n\\nof the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nbeing a major seat for tenacity and willpower\\n\\ncomes from Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett,\\n\\nwho is soon to be a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast.\\n\\nWe've actually recorded that episode already\\n\\nand it should be out very soon.\\n\\nLisa's laboratory is well known\\n\\nfor pioneering research on emotion and affect.\\n\\nI strongly encourage you to listen to that episode\\n\\nonce it comes out.\\n\\nAnd it was actually Lisa herself that cued me\\n\\nto the importance of the anterior mid-singulate cortex.\\n\\nAnd Lisa and colleagues have written\\n\\nseveral spectacular reviews\\n\\nabout the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nand its role in tenacity and motivation.\\n\\nI will provide links to a few of those\\n\\nin the show note captions.\\n\\nThe one that I'm particularly excited about,\\n\\nthe one that I've spent now an immense amount of time with\\n\\nis entitled, The Tenacious Brain,\\n\\nHow the Anterior Mid-Singulate Cortex\\n\\nContributes to Achieving Goals.\\n\\nSo if you have a background in biology,\\n\\neven if you don't,\\n\\nI think you'll find that review to be very interesting.\\n\\nAnd it further substantiates a lot of the points\\n\\nthat I made a few moments ago\\n\\nabout the different scenarios and types of individuals\\n\\nthat seem to be able to engage\\n\\ntheir anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nunder different conditions\\n\\nand to a greater or lesser extent than others.\\n\\nSo hats off to Lisa for cuing me\\n\\nto this incredibly interesting brain structure.\\n\\nI had known that it existed,\\n\\nafter all I teach neuroanatomy to medical students\\n\\nat Stanford and I taught neuroanatomy for many, many years,\\n\\nbut I don't think enough people\\n\\nand indeed very few professional neuroscientists\\n\\ncould tell you what the anterior mid-singulate cortex does,\\n\\nbut it has this apparently incredible function\\n\\nin generating tenacity and motivation.\\n\\nAlong those lines,\\n\\none of the most incredible and important studies\\n\\nabout the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nand its capacity to generate feelings of tenacity\\n\\nand willpower comes from one of my colleagues at Stanford,\\n\\nJoe Parvizzi, who essentially went into human beings\\n\\nwho needed brain surgery for other reasons\\n\\nand stimulated particular brain areas\\n\\nwith a very high degree of precision.\\n\\nThe title of the paper that I'm referring to\\n\\nwas published in 2013 in the journal,\\n\\nNeuron Cell Press Journal, excellent journal,\\n\\nand it's entitled,\\n\\nThe Will to Persevere Induced by Electrical Stimulation\\n\\nof the Human Singulat Gyrus.\\n\\nNow you'll notice the title said human cingulate gyrus,\\n\\nnot anterior mid-singulate gyrus,\\n\\nbut because they had electrodes\\n\\nand a stimulation technique\\n\\nthat would allow them to stimulate in very small regions,\\n\\nextending as little as five millimeters,\\n\\nbut no more away from the stimulation site.\\n\\nThey were able to march the stimulation\\n\\naround different sub-regions of the cingulate gyrus\\n\\nof humans while those people were awake,\\n\\nand then ask those people, how do you feel?\\n\\nWhat are you experiencing in this moment?\\n\\nIn addition to that,\\n\\nthey were recording various autonomic parameters\\n\\nfrom those people, so heart rate, breathing,\\n\\nin addition to brain wave activity.\\n\\nSo what the subjects report\\n\\nwhen their anterior mid-singulate cortex was stimulated\\n\\nis that in their words, something was about to happen.\\n\\nThey felt as if there was some sort of pressure upon them\\n\\nfrom the outside, not physical pressure,\\n\\nbut that something was about to happen.\\n\\nIn fact, one of the subjects described the sensation as,\\n\\nit's as if there's a storm off in the distance,\\n\\nbut I know I need to go into the storm\\n\\nand I know I can make it through the storm.\\n\\nAnother subject described the experience\\n\\nof having their anterior mid-singulate cortex stimulated\\n\\nas, okay, something not necessarily good is going to happen,\\n\\nbut I know that I need to marshal resources and resist,\\n\\nand I'm confident that I can push through.\\n\\nNow, because Parvesi and colleagues\\n\\nare excellent scientists,\\n\\nthey of course did control experiments\\n\\nwhere they would tell the person,\\n\\nokay, we're stimulating that same brain area\\n\\nthat a moment ago you told me created this feeling\\n\\nof some pressure upon you that you have to resist,\\n\\nsome sense of fight or urgency to push back.\\n\\nBut in reality, during certain control conditions,\\n\\nthey were not stimulating those brain areas.\\n\\nAnd the subjects then reported,\\n\\nI don't feel like anything's about to happen.\\n\\nYeah, I don't feel anything at all.\\n\\nIn other words, it was the stimulation\\n\\nof the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nand only the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nthat created the sensation within people\\n\\nthat there was something to resist,\\n\\nthat there was something putting pressure on them,\\n\\nagain, not physical pressure, but psychological pressure,\\n\\nand that they were going to have to marshal resources\\n\\nin order to push back upon.\\n\\nIn fact, they reported feeling as if their body\\n\\nwas getting ready to do something.\\n\\nOne subject said something along the lines of,\\n\\nI feel like I'm about to do something,\\n\\nI'm about to go someplace or do something\\n\\nto resist this foreboding sense that's now coming over me.\\n\\nSo this is very interesting, and of course is in line\\n\\nwith all of the data that we discussed before\\n\\nabout neural activity patterns,\\n\\nboth spontaneous and evoked,\\n\\nabout brain volume changes\\n\\nin the anterior mid-singulate cortex, so on and so forth.\\n\\nAnd it really points to the idea\\n\\nthat the anterior mid-singulate cortex is a hub,\\n\\na hub that receives information\\n\\nfrom a diversity of brain areas\\n\\nthat we talked about a few minutes ago,\\n\\nand that generates a particular sense within us\\n\\nthat we are going to be forward center of mass,\\n\\nthat we are going to resist something,\\n\\nand that perhaps we are going to move or act\\n\\nin some particular way, or as we've been discussing\\n\\nall along, resist action in some particular way,\\n\\nbut that it requires that we marshal resources,\\n\\nwhich takes us back, of course,\\n\\nto the studies of Baumeister and indeed of Dweck,\\n\\nwhere they explored willpower as a limited resource,\\n\\nperhaps, glucose perhaps as that limited resource,\\n\\nbeliefs about willpower and glucose,\\n\\nprobably with a high degree of certainty,\\n\\nare going to be involved there too.\\n\\nBut regardless of that controversy,\\n\\nit's clear that there's an energy required.\\n\\nThere's an activation state of engagement\\n\\nor resistance to a particular behavior or thought pattern\\n\\nthat we all associate with this phenomenon\\n\\nof tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nAnd in a kind of miraculous way,\\n\\nas a neuroscientist, we're generally taught nowadays\\n\\nthat individual brain areas\\n\\ndon't really trigger individual functions\\n\\nand perceptions of the brain.\\n\\nThere are a few exceptions to that.\\n\\nYou have a fusiform face area\\n\\nthat really does seem to be involved\\n\\nin the perception of faces.\\n\\nAnd when lesioned, you can't recognize faces.\\n\\nBut outside of just a few limited contexts,\\n\\nit's very rare that one comes across a literature\\n\\nthat cross all of the studies involved,\\n\\npoint to a single brain structure and its networks\\n\\nas giving rise to something as complex and flexible\\n\\nas tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nBut in the case of the intermidsingulate cortex,\\n\\nit really does seem to meet those criteria\\n\\nas the brain hub responsible for tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nNow, a key idea that Dr. Feldman Barrett has contributed\\n\\nto studies of the intermidsingulate cortex\\n\\nas a structure that helps us generate\\n\\nwhat we call tenacity and willpower\\n\\nto help us achieve different types of goals\\n\\nis this idea of allostasis.\\n\\nMost of you have perhaps heard of homeostasis,\\n\\nwhich is the idea that all of our cells, all of our organs,\\n\\nindeed our entire body and psychology\\n\\nare always seeking homeostasis,\\n\\nthe perfect balance of sleep and activity,\\n\\nof food and burning fuels,\\n\\nof oxygen and carbon dioxide and so on and so forth.\\n\\nAnd while homeostasis certainly exists\\n\\nand is a valid phenomenon,\\n\\nthere's also a concept that we hear far less about,\\n\\nbut that is equally important,\\n\\nwhich is the concept of allostasis.\\n\\nAllostasis is the idea that much of what our brain\\n\\nand body need to do, but especially our brain,\\n\\nis to allocate, right, allostasis,\\n\\nto allocate resources to particular functions\\n\\ndepending on our motivational goals\\n\\nand the challenges upon us.\\n\\nAnd in every way, what we understand about the structure\\n\\nand function of the anterior midsingulate cortex\\n\\nis that it is doing just that.\\n\\nIt is deciding how much glucose\\n\\nshould a given brain area consume,\\n\\nperhaps a brain area that's involved in visual perception\\n\\nbecause you're involved in a motivational task\\n\\nwhere in order to succeed,\\n\\nyou need to pay careful visual attention\\n\\nto particular things,\\n\\nor you're involved in a task\\n\\nwhere you have to listen to particular things,\\n\\nor perhaps you are involved in a physical foot race\\n\\nwhere you don't want to allocate a lot of energy\\n\\ntowards thinking about your stride or your step\\n\\nunless that's necessary,\\n\\nand you actually want to shut down your brain activity\\n\\nas much as possible,\\n\\nexcept for the brain areas that are required\\n\\nto get you to continue to run.\\n\\nIn that sense, the anterior midsingulate cortex\\n\\nas a sort of a dial on how much fuel is consumed,\\n\\nnot by the brain and body as a whole,\\n\\nbut by individual brain and body parts,\\n\\nmeets all the criteria of what you would want\\n\\nfor a brain area that controls things\\n\\nlike tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nBecause even for those individuals\\n\\nwho seem to just have an endless supply\\n\\nof tenacity and willpower,\\n\\nthey too have to go into habitual behavior.\\n\\nThey can't simply lean into every aspect of life\\n\\nwith the kind of resistance from outside\\n\\nand the resistance against those outside forces,\\n\\nor even resistance to internal forces,\\n\\nvoices in their head, et cetera, on a constant basis.\\n\\nThey still need to sleep.\\n\\nThey still need to be functional\\n\\nin that expression of tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nThey need to be able to strategy switch,\\n\\nand they need to be able to come off the gas, as we say,\\n\\nnot because tenacity and willpower\\n\\nare necessarily a limited resource,\\n\\nbut because for so many aspects of life,\\n\\nengaging tenacity and willpower is not advantageous.\\n\\nHence the example I gave earlier about eating disorders,\\n\\nwhere an apparently hardwired function of our brain\\n\\nto be able to generate some sort of reward\\n\\nfor resisting a given behavior goes too far\\n\\nand then can actually threaten one's own health\\n\\nor even life.\\n\\nSo the concept of allostatic load, allostatic balance,\\n\\nand allostatic function is something that we get into\\n\\nin a fair amount of detail in the discussion\\n\\nwith Dr. Feldman Barrett in that episode,\\n\\nwhich is coming out soon.\\n\\nBut in the meantime,\\n\\nif you were to think about the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nas having a single function,\\n\\nthe function that Dr. Feldman Barrett has ascribed to it\\n\\nas controlling how much energy different brain\\n\\nand body areas should get in a given context,\\n\\nwell, that makes a lot of sense to me,\\n\\nand I think it's the one that best describes\\n\\nall of the functional data,\\n\\nindeed includes or jives with all the anatomical data\\n\\nabout the anterior mid-singulate cortex as well.\\n\\nOne of the really important twists in all of this\\n\\nis that the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nis not just sitting there to allocate\\n\\nand dole out different amounts of energy\\n\\nand activation to different brain areas.\\n\\nIt is also receiving input from both the brain and body.\\n\\nAnd in sort of a beautiful twist on the whole story\\n\\nof what the anterior mid-singulate cortex does,\\n\\nwe know that when we move our body,\\n\\nwe are activating the anterior mid-singulate cortex.\\n\\nAnd we know that when we move our body,\\n\\nbecause we in some way forced ourselves\\n\\nor encouraged ourselves to do it,\\n\\nwe activate the anterior mid-singulate cortex more.\\n\\nSimilarly, and because the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nis so flexible in the different contexts\\n\\nin which it can be activated,\\n\\nif we are simply reading\\n\\nor we are listening to something\\n\\nthat we're supposed to learn\\n\\nor trying to learn a piece of music\\n\\nor trying to do anything for that matter,\\n\\nthe anterior mid-singulate cortex, yes, will be activated,\\n\\nbut that its levels of activation are far greater\\n\\nwhen we experience a lot of resistance\\n\\nthat we have to overcome.\\n\\nRemember the earlier results,\\n\\nand by the way, I'll provide a link\\n\\nin the show note captions to this particular study\\n\\nor set of studies.\\n\\nThere are about two, one really spectacular one\\n\\nand a couple of others\\n\\nthat tangentially points to the same finding\\n\\nthat when people engage in a hard task,\\n\\nnot an easy task, but a hard task\\n\\nthat the anterior mid-singulate cortex activity is elevated.\\n\\nSo the way to think about the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nis that it's not just sitting there as a hub\\n\\nthat you have to reach into and activate,\\n\\nit's also receiving inputs that can activate it.\\n\\nAnd that's what allows us to now talk\\n\\nabout the tools and protocols\\n\\nthat don't just allow us to engage\\n\\nour anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nand access more tenacity and willpower,\\n\\nbut that allow us to exercise,\\n\\nnot necessarily in the context of physical exercise,\\n\\nalthough it could be that too,\\n\\nbut to exercise our anterior mid-singulate cortices ability\\n\\nto engage not just in that challenging context,\\n\\nbut in other challenging contexts as well.\\n\\nIn fact, I'll just tell you right now\\n\\nthat studies in non-human primates\\n\\nand to a limited extent in humans,\\n\\nbut here we think there's a strong analog\\n\\nbetween the non-human primate data and the human data,\\n\\nthe anterior mid-singulate cortex is chock-a-block full\\n\\nof the expression of molecules such as chem kinase II,\\n\\nreceptors to various neurotrophins,\\n\\nparticular types of NMDA and methyl deaspartate receptors,\\n\\nall of which, if none of those names mean anything to you,\\n\\njust know that all of them refer to different aspects of,\\n\\nand a capacity for synaptic plasticity,\\n\\nwhich is the ability for connections in the brain to change.\\n\\nThey can get stronger, you can actually grow new connections.\\n\\nIn other words, the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\ncan be built up as a structure\\n\\nto engage tenacity and willpower\\n\\nby activating it through one or a limited number\\n\\nof different types of behaviors,\\n\\nmeaning engagement in behaviors\\n\\nthat frankly we would rather not engage in,\\n\\nas well as not engaging in behaviors\\n\\nthat reflexively we really want to,\\n\\nthat we're sort of drawn to engage in.\\n\\nBoth of those contexts that I absolutely will,\\n\\neven though frankly I don't want to,\\n\\nor you're telling me I can't,\\n\\nas well as the I absolutely won't,\\n\\neven though you're tempting me to do that\\n\\nor that's tempting me to do that,\\n\\nor even I'm tempted to do that,\\n\\nthat buildup of the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nhas extensive carryover into other domains of life\\n\\nbecause it's the same structure\\n\\nthat is then used for other types of behaviors\\n\\nand learning that require tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nSo that's incredibly reassuring.\\n\\nIn fact, it's downright exciting\\n\\nbecause as I mentioned earlier,\\n\\nwhile there are a near infinite number\\n\\nof different circumstances\\n\\nwhere we each and all need tenacity and willpower,\\n\\nit seems that there's a very generic mechanism\\n\\nfor generating tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nAnd that means that if we can build up our capacity\\n\\nfor tenacity and willpower\\n\\nby engaging in particular types of behaviors\\n\\nand resisting particular types of behaviors,\\n\\nwell, then it's going to carry over\\n\\nin a very functional way to the other aspects of life\\n\\nthat we find challenging\\n\\nand that we may find challenging in the future.\\n\\nOkay, so by now I like to think that I've convinced you\\n\\nbecause frankly the data are very convincing\\n\\nthat the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nis a vital hub within your brain\\n\\nfor allocating energy and resources\\n\\nto generating tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nAnd perhaps it's taken you a lot of tenacity and willpower\\n\\nto get this far through the episode,\\n\\nwaiting with bated breath presumably\\n\\nto learn how exactly you can improve\\n\\nthe functioning of your anterior mid-singulate cortex.\\n\\nNow, fortunately, there are published peer-reviewed data\\n\\nthat explain how to do that.\\n\\nIn fact, there's a study that was published in 2006\\n\\nby Colum and colleagues entitled,\\n\\naerobic exercise training increases brain volume\\n\\nin aging humans.\\n\\nAnd before you go run off literally\\n\\nand engage in cardiovascular exercise,\\n\\nI'm just going to describe to you the contour of this study\\n\\nand what specifically was done\\n\\nso that you can best implement the best protocols\\n\\nfor your particular circumstances.\\n\\nThis was a study exploring why and how\\n\\ncertain brain areas and brain volume generally decreases\\n\\nas we age.\\n\\nIt's well known, as I mentioned earlier,\\n\\nthat individuals aged really 50 and older\\n\\nand maybe as early as 30 and older\\n\\nexperience a decrease in brain volume\\n\\nwith particular brain areas shrinking faster than others.\\n\\nBut of course, there are other people\\n\\nthat include the super-agers that we talked about earlier\\n\\nand many, many other people who are not super-agers\\n\\nwho don't experience the same decrease in brain volume.\\n\\nSo why is it that they maintain the same brain size\\n\\nthat they did when they were younger\\n\\nor undergo less decrease in brain size?\\n\\nThat's what the researchers for this study\\n\\nwere initially interested in understanding.\\n\\nAnd they did come to some really interesting conclusions\\n\\nabout that, but they also came to some interesting conclusions\\n\\nthat relate to today's discussion on tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nThis study involved having individuals\\n\\nwho were 60 to 79 years old\\n\\ndivided into one of two groups.\\n\\nOne group did cardiovascular exercise.\\n\\nThe other group did more calisthenics\\n\\nslash stretching type exercise.\\n\\nBoth groups did one hour of exercise three times per week.\\n\\nThe group that did cardiovascular training\\n\\ninitially started off by doing,\\n\\nand by the way, they just simply called it aerobic training,\\n\\nbut this could be rowing on the rower,\\n\\nthis could be running, this could be cycling.\\n\\nI think for sake of understanding\\n\\napplication of tools and protocols,\\n\\nyou would want to pick any kind of activity\\n\\nthat you could do consistently without injuring yourself.\\n\\nThat's what's really important.\\n\\nAnd that gets your heart rate elevated.\\n\\nThey started off these individuals\\n\\nwith relatively low intensity\\n\\ncardiovascular exercise for that hour,\\n\\ngetting their heart rate up to about 50%\\n\\nof their maximum heart rate,\\n\\nbut very quickly had those individuals increase the intensity\\n\\nof those cardiovascular training sessions.\\n\\nSo they were doing, again, three one hour sessions per week,\\n\\ngetting their heart rate up to about 75%\\n\\nof their maximum heart rate, sometimes a little less,\\n\\n60%, sometimes a little bit more,\\n\\nbut in that general range.\\n\\nSo for those of you that think about\\n\\ndifferent zones of cardio,\\n\\nthis is probably in the area of zone three,\\n\\nnot quite zone two cardio, maybe zone three cardio.\\n\\nSo where one can not carry out a conversation very easily,\\n\\nbut where one is not completely gasping for air\\n\\nas one would if they went to their maximum heart rate\\n\\nor near maximum heart rate.\\n\\nOkay, so three one hour episodes\\n\\nof cardiovascular training per week\\n\\nat a moderately high intensity.\\n\\nThe other group simply doing calisthenics and stretching\\n\\nfor the equivalent amount of time.\\n\\nAnd they had another group within the study\\n\\nthat were much younger,\\n\\nthat did similar activities or no activity\\n\\nsimply as a control for the brain imaging data.\\n\\nNow I'm summarizing the study with a fairly broad brush,\\n\\nboth for sake of time.\\n\\nAnd of course I'll provide a link to the study\\n\\nin the show note caption\\n\\nso you can access it and peruse in more detail if you like.\\n\\nBut I wouldn't be talking about this study\\n\\nif it were simply a study about cardiovascular training\\n\\nand brain volume.\\n\\nI'm talking about this study\\n\\nbecause the specific brain areas that maintained\\n\\nor in some cases increased in volume\\n\\nas a consequence of doing these three hours per week\\n\\nof moderate intensity cardiovascular training\\n\\nincluded of course, the anterior mid-singulate cortex.\\n\\nThat was actually the primary location\\n\\nin which the maintenance of brain volume was observed.\\n\\nAnd in some cases,\\n\\nincreases in brain volume were observed, right?\\n\\nThis is a group of people who normally would be losing\\n\\nvolume size of their anterior mid-singulate cortex,\\n\\nbut for which three hours a week\\n\\nof moderate intensity cardiovascular training\\n\\nmaintained the volume,\\n\\nthe size of that anterior mid-singulate cortex.\\n\\nAnd in some cases increased the volume,\\n\\nthe size of anterior mid-singulate cortex.\\n\\nAnd they also observed a maintenance or increase\\n\\nin the size of the anterior white matter tracts.\\n\\nRemember, T-R-A-C-T-S.\\n\\nI didn't spell that out before just to spell it out for fun,\\n\\nalthough that is the sort of thing that I would probably do.\\n\\nThose white matter tracts are the communication routes\\n\\nby which different brain areas communicate\\n\\nand this anterior white matter tract that maintained size\\n\\nin the people that did cardiovascular training\\n\\nas compared to those that simply did\\n\\nthe calisthenics training and stretching\\n\\nis the very white matter tracts that connects\\n\\nthe two sides of the brain, the frontal lobes,\\n\\nthat allows the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\non one side of the brain\\n\\nand the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\non the other side of the brain\\n\\nas well as other brain structures\\n\\nto communicate with one another.\\n\\nSo this is really spectacular.\\n\\nI mean, the authors of the study\\n\\ndidn't embark on the study to find\\n\\nor even look for increases or maintenance\\n\\nin the volume of the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nand the communication routes\\n\\nin and out of the anterior mid-singulate cortex.\\n\\nIt just so happened that cardiovascular training\\n\\ndone three times per week for an hour at a time\\n\\nat moderate intensity increased the size\\n\\nof the anterior mid-singulate cortex.\\n\\nAnd as I mentioned, the white matter tracts\\n\\nwhich allow information to go in and out\\n\\nof the anterior mid-singulate cortex.\\n\\nNow we should all be asking ourselves,\\n\\nwhy would that be the case?\\n\\nI mean, somebody gets on a stationary bike and pedals\\n\\nor goes out on a road bike or runs.\\n\\nIs there something inherent to running or cycling\\n\\nor rowing or swimming or an aerobics class,\\n\\ndancing, et cetera, that gets the heart rate up\\n\\nthat directly feeds into the anterior mid-singulate cortex?\\n\\nAfter all, is the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nresponsible for generating the activity of running\\n\\nor cycling or swimming?\\n\\nNo, rather the interpretation is that\\n\\nin order to engage in this one hour,\\n\\nthree times per week set of sessions\\n\\nof cardiovascular training, they had to allocate resources.\\n\\nThey had to get up out of a chair.\\n\\nThey had to get off the couch.\\n\\nThey had to say no to other potential obligations,\\n\\nsocial engagements, meals, et cetera,\\n\\nand get to these exercise classes or sessions\\n\\nthat they did with others or alone.\\n\\nNow an interesting and in fact important aspect\\n\\nof the study is that the compliance\\n\\nwith this three hours per week\\n\\nof cardiovascular training was very high.\\n\\n85% of individuals engaged in these sessions\\n\\nacross the six month period of the study.\\n\\nI should have mentioned that earlier.\\n\\nThe study was carried out over the course of six months.\\n\\nThey did not have the opportunity to do neuroimaging\\n\\nafter say a week or two weeks.\\n\\nSo they imaged these people's brains before\\n\\nand they imaged these people's brains\\n\\nafter the six month period.\\n\\nIt's anybody's guess as to whether or not\\n\\nthey would have observed the same\\n\\nor maybe even greater increases\\n\\nat the one month interval, et cetera.\\n\\nWe simply don't know.\\n\\nIt was a great cost, both energetic and financial\\n\\nto doing these kinds of studies.\\n\\nSo they looked at a six month period.\\n\\nBut setting all of that aside,\\n\\nthis is a very important study\\n\\nin the context of today's discussion\\n\\nbecause what it means is that\\n\\nif we acknowledge that the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nand the volume of anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nis related to one's ability to generate tenacity\\n\\nand willpower for any number of different endeavors,\\n\\nwell, then having access to a tool or a protocol\\n\\nthat can increase the size of one's\\n\\nanterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nis going to be extremely valuable.\\n\\nSo what's the takeaway from this study?\\n\\nThe takeaway from the study is not necessarily\\n\\nthat you should be doing three one hour bouts\\n\\nof cardiovascular training per week for six months\\n\\nto maintain or increase the size\\n\\nof your anterior mid-singulate cortex.\\n\\nI do think that's the case\\n\\nif you're not already doing sufficient amounts\\n\\nof cardiovascular training\\n\\nand what constitutes sufficient amounts?\\n\\nWell, I think there's general agreement now\\n\\nboth between the material that I've covered\\n\\nin our foundational fitness protocol\\n\\nand in the series on exercise physiology\\n\\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin\\n\\nand in various discussions with Dr. Peter Atiyah.\\n\\nThe general agreement is that everyone should be getting\\n\\nsomewhere between 150 to 200 minutes\\n\\nof so-called zone two low intensity\\n\\ncardiovascular exercise per week.\\n\\nBut the results of this study really points to the idea\\n\\nthat we should all be doing perhaps three hours,\\n\\nbut certainly we should all be doing\\n\\nsome form of physical exercise.\\n\\nBut for any of us that are interested\\n\\nin increasing tenacity and willpower across domains,\\n\\nboth for cognitive and physical endeavors,\\n\\nemotional endeavors too, for that matter,\\n\\nthat we should be engaging in some exercise.\\n\\nAnd again, we're going to talk about\\n\\ncognitive exercise in a moment,\\n\\nbut that we should be engaging in some exercise\\n\\nthat we are not already doing.\\n\\nNow that of course will lead many people to think,\\n\\nwait, I'm already doing 200 minutes per week\\n\\nof zone two cardio.\\n\\nHow can I add three hours more of cardio?\\n\\nThat's not what I'm saying.\\n\\nWhat's important to understand\\n\\nabout this whole discussion about tenacity and willpower\\n\\nis that the ability to engage the anterior mid-singulate\\n\\ncortex and to build up its volume literally\\n\\nand increase its activity,\\n\\nrelies on one critical feature,\\n\\nwhich is that you have to be in some degree of resistance,\\n\\nsome lack of desire,\\n\\nor I should say lack of reflexive desire\\n\\nor ability to engage in that behavior, okay?\\n\\nThis is super important\\n\\nif you're thinking about tools and protocols\\n\\nto increase your level of tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nIf for instance, you love cold showers and ice baths,\\n\\nwell, then it's very unlikely that taking cold showers\\n\\nor getting into an ice bath is going to increase\\n\\nyour level of tenacity and willpower further.\\n\\nIt might reinforce the tenacity and willpower\\n\\nthat you've already built,\\n\\nbut it's not going to increase it further.\\n\\nYou need to add something or subtract something\\n\\nthat makes it harder, not easier,\\n\\nto engage in or resist a behavior.\\n\\nOkay, I want to be really clear about this.\\n\\nIn the study that I just described from Coleman colleagues,\\n\\nthey took individuals\\n\\nthat were not exercising prior to the study,\\n\\nand those people had to therefore generate\\n\\nsignificant amounts of motivation\\n\\nin order to regularly engage\\n\\nin these three one hour per week episodes\\n\\nof cardiovascular training.\\n\\nOkay, now the fact that there was no comparable increase\\n\\nin the volume of the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nor anterior white matter tracts in the group\\n\\nthat did the calisthenics and stretching is also important\\n\\nbecause it implies that activities\\n\\nthat are easier to carry out\\n\\nthat don't get the heart rate elevated as much\\n\\nare not going to create changes in this brain structure\\n\\nthat is associated with tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nAnd there's a nice confirmation of that in the study,\\n\\nin fact, because they observed, as one would expect,\\n\\na significant increase in VO2 max in the individuals\\n\\nthat were assigned to the group\\n\\nthat did cardiovascular training,\\n\\nbut they did not observe a significant increase in VO2 max\\n\\nin the individuals that did three one hour per week sessions\\n\\nof calisthenics and stretching across the six month period.\\n\\nOkay, so the important point here is,\\n\\nif you're already doing, let's say,\\n\\nan hour a week of moderate to high intensity\\n\\ncardiovascular training or resistance training\\n\\nfor that matter, you're going to need to add something\\n\\nin order to get further activation of this brain hub\\n\\nfor tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nAnd of course, the idea here,\\n\\nor else we wouldn't be talking about it,\\n\\nis that that activation and that increase in volume\\n\\nin the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nwould then be applicable to other endeavors,\\n\\nfor instance, academics or some aspect\\n\\nof your professional life or relationship life,\\n\\nthat you can build up tenacity and willpower\\n\\nas a capacity within you,\\n\\nor we should say within your anterior mid-singulate\\n\\ncortices, but that the route to activating\\n\\nand increasing the robustness\\n\\nof your anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nrequires that you engage in something\\n\\nthat you don't really want to do\\n\\nand certainly not something\\n\\nthat you're regularly engaging in already.\\n\\nRemember, way back at the beginning of today's episode,\\n\\nwe compared willpower and tenacity to habit execution, right?\\n\\nWell, this is a simple case\\n\\nwhere if you're already doing something,\\n\\nsimply continuing to do it\\n\\nmight maintain what you've already got,\\n\\nbut it's not going to further build up\\n\\nyour tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nSo along those lines, I don't want you to simply\\n\\ntake the three one-hour cardiovascular sessions per week\\n\\nprotocol that they use within this study\\n\\nand expect it to increase your levels\\n\\nof tenacity and willpower,\\n\\nunless, of course, you're currently only doing\\n\\none hour of cardiovascular training\\n\\nat moderate to high intensity per week,\\n\\nin which case, increasing to two hours\\n\\nmay very well increase your anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nand overall level of tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nAnd certainly doing three hours per week\\n\\nwould be expected to do it even further.\\n\\nAnd I should mention that we can extrapolate\\n\\nfrom this study in a meaningful way,\\n\\nI think in a grounded way that's related to mechanism\\n\\nand say, well, if you, for instance, like me,\\n\\ncan't play a musical instrument\\n\\nor are not bilingual in language,\\n\\nthat taking on the challenge, if indeed it's a challenge,\\n\\nand for me, it would be a challenge,\\n\\nperhaps for you as well,\\n\\nto learn an instrument as an adult\\n\\nor to learn a second or maybe a third language.\\n\\nIf that's challenging, and in fact,\\n\\nthat's something that you're resisting doing,\\n\\nwell, then great, it's going to provide\\n\\nan even greater opportunity to engage the activity\\n\\nof the anterior mid-singulate cortex.\\n\\nRemember that study that showed that hard tasks,\\n\\nhard challenges are what activate\\n\\nthe anterior mid-singulate cortex.\\n\\nEasy challenges don't, okay?\\n\\nHabits that are reflexive simply do not.\\n\\nSo you have to pick something hard.\\n\\nYou have to pick something that's either physically\\n\\nand or psychologically hard.\\n\\nAnd of course, we want to highlight the fact\\n\\nthat you never want to engage in anything physical\\n\\nor cognitive, emotional or otherwise\\n\\nthat is psychologically or physically damaging to you, right?\\n\\nBecause this is something that you're going to want\\n\\nto maintain or carry out for some period of time.\\n\\nNow, along those lines,\\n\\nwe could imagine a huge number of different protocols\\n\\nthat one could engage in,\\n\\nbut I think there are a couple of key things\\n\\nthat extend across all of those opportunities.\\n\\nFirst of all, it's clear now based on our understanding\\n\\nof the anatomical inputs\\n\\nto the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nthat while exercise is great\\n\\nand certainly movement of the body\\n\\nwhen we don't want to move our body,\\n\\nAKA running, AKA weightlifting,\\n\\nAKA learning a new skill like dancing or gymnastics\\n\\nor something of that sort,\\n\\nis going to engage this hub for tenacity and willpower,\\n\\nthe anterior mid-singulate cortex.\\n\\nBut there are a number of other opportunities to do that.\\n\\nAnd we can think of those in a kind of playful context,\\n\\nbut one that is both playful\\n\\nand highly functional and applicable.\\n\\nSo for instance, if you already resistance train\\n\\nand you're doing what we now generally agree as a field\\n\\nis the minimum of six hard working sets per muscle group\\n\\nper week in order to maintain\\n\\nor build muscle size and strength.\\n\\nSome of you don't want to build muscle size,\\n\\nbut everyone should be trying to maintain muscle strength.\\n\\nThere's a very high correlation.\\n\\nWe now know between muscle strength and cognitive function,\\n\\nespecially as one gets past 40 years of age,\\n\\nbut even younger.\\n\\nSo maintaining neuromuscular function\\n\\nand strength is very, very important.\\n\\nEven if you don't want to increase muscle size,\\n\\nyou can learn how to do that by the way.\\n\\nWe have zero cost protocols.\\n\\nThey're all listed out by going to hubermanlab.com.\\n\\nCheck out the series that I did with Dr. Andy Galpin.\\n\\nCheck out the key toolkit takeaways from that series.\\n\\nAlso available at hubermanlab.com.\\n\\nJust put exercise protocols into the search function.\\n\\nBut let's say you're already resistance training.\\n\\nYou're already doing cardiovascular training.\\n\\nWhat can you do to build up your tenacity and willpower\\n\\nfor application in not just that endeavor,\\n\\nbut other endeavors?\\n\\nWell, pick something that you don't want to do.\\n\\nThese are what I call in a very non-scientific way,\\n\\nmicro sucks.\\n\\nThese things suck, but they suck a little bit\\n\\nand they're safe, right?\\n\\nYou have to pick things that are safe for you.\\n\\nBut they suck enough that they require some effort.\\n\\nThey require getting over some friction,\\n\\nengaging in something\\n\\nthat you don't reflexively want to do.\\n\\nSo for instance, that might be one extra set\\n\\nat the end of a round of three to five sets\\n\\nof a given exercise.\\n\\nOr it could be, for instance,\\n\\na hundred jumping jacks at the end\\n\\nof what you consider a hard run.\\n\\nIt could be, for instance,\\n\\nfinishing out that language lesson\\n\\nand then deciding to do five minutes of sitting still,\\n\\nthinking about the material that you learned\\n\\nwhen you so desperately want to just jump on your phone,\\n\\nright?\\n\\nPick circumstances where the degree of resistance\\n\\nis very high,\\n\\nwhere the degree of impulse to do something else,\\n\\nthen the thing that you know you need to do is very high.\\n\\nAnd then start applying those on a regular basis.\\n\\nIt could be after every workout.\\n\\nIt could be in the middle of the workout.\\n\\nFor instance, some people have a really hard time\\n\\nnot looking at their phone during a workout.\\n\\nI like to listen to podcasts or music during a workout,\\n\\nbut I really try and resist text messaging\\n\\nand reading email and things of that sort while working out.\\n\\nSo the harder that becomes, the more I think about it\\n\\nand the more I resist it,\\n\\nthe more presumably activation\\n\\nof the enter mid-singulate cortex I'm getting\\n\\nand that you would get as well.\\n\\nSo these little micro sucks,\\n\\nlike it sucks not to look at the phone right now.\\n\\nIt sucks to do a hundred jumping jacks at the end of a run.\\n\\nOf course, if you're excited due to the hundred jumping jacks\\n\\nat the end of the run,\\n\\nthat's not going to be a good avenue\\n\\ninto activating and increasing the volume\\n\\nof your enter mid-singulate cortex.\\n\\nEverything we've talked about up until now\\n\\nsupports the statement I just made.\\n\\nEasy tasks, desirable tasks, don't do it.\\n\\nIt's the thing you don't want to do.\\n\\nSo imparting these little micro sucks can be very useful.\\n\\nYou'll have to think about what particular micro sucks\\n\\nyou incorporate into your exercise routines,\\n\\nyour cognitive routines and your daily routines\\n\\nand how often.\\n\\nI don't think you need to go completely berserk on this\\n\\ndoing them all day long,\\n\\nbut keep in mind that these are the sorts of behaviors\\n\\nand resistance of behaviors,\\n\\nbecause again, certain micro sucks might be,\\n\\nif you're somebody who practices intermittent fasting,\\n\\nwe don't want to send you into the realm\\n\\nof eating disorder,\\n\\nbut maybe you really do wait an extra 15 minutes\\n\\nbefore your usual first meal time,\\n\\nwhich for me would really suck.\\n\\nThat might even move from micro suck into macro suck\\n\\nbecause I like to eat when I'm hungry,\\n\\nbut waiting a few extra minutes for no other reason\\n\\nthan allowing oneself to activate\\n\\nthat anterior mid-singulate cortex circuitry\\n\\nwould be one way to try and build up\\n\\none's tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nSo at some level, this should all seem pretty logical.\\n\\nIt actually doesn't even require a firm understanding\\n\\nof the underlying neuroscience for it to make sense.\\n\\nYou want to do something, you resist doing it.\\n\\nThat's building up tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nYou don't really want to do something, you do it.\\n\\nThat's building up tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nWell, I do believe in fact,\\n\\nthere's a lot of data to support the fact\\n\\nthat our understanding of the mechanisms\\n\\nunderneath things like tenacity and willpower\\n\\ncan be very advantageous when trying to carry out\\n\\nthese different types of behaviors\\n\\nto increase tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nWell, today we learned that there's a huge variety\\n\\nof contexts in which one can activate\\n\\nthe anterior mid-singulate cortex,\\n\\nwhich means that it's not cardiovascular exercise per se.\\n\\nIt's not resisting the cookie per se.\\n\\nIt's not waiting 15 more minutes to eat\\n\\nor making sure that you sit still\\n\\nand don't look at your phone at the end of a learning ballot\\n\\nand really think about what you learned a little bit more.\\n\\nYou know, it really, really sucks to do that.\\n\\nIt's really hard, it creates a lot of agitation.\\n\\nIt's not about any one of those protocols, if you will,\\n\\nper se, rather it's about deliberate engagement\\n\\nin the behaviors that we least want to do in a given moment.\\n\\nOr if you're trying to build up willpower and tenacity\\n\\nto not engage in certain types of behaviors,\\n\\nit's about our ability to suppress behavioral action.\\n\\nNow, I do want to highlight the potential hazards\\n\\nof this type of approach to building up tenacity\\n\\nand willpower and indeed to life.\\n\\nAnd we can call on the earlier example\\n\\nof eating disorders as a very salient one, right?\\n\\nThere is a way in which all of this can run amok\\n\\nand we can get so heavily into stoicism,\\n\\nwe can get so heavily into the idea\\n\\nof building up tenacity and willpower\\n\\nthat it takes us into realms that are unhealthy\\n\\nfor us psychologically, emotionally, and or physically.\\n\\nAnd that's certainly not the goal here.\\n\\nAnd I certainly don't want to motivate\\n\\nthat type of behavior or resistance of behavior.\\n\\nWe should all be seeking a relationship with life\\n\\nand with goals, et cetera, that involves, yes,\\n\\nI believe some degree of activating tenacity and willpower,\\n\\nreally finding that fight within us\\n\\nthat Parvizzi and colleagues found\\n\\nwhen they stimulated the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nof people, right?\\n\\nAnd suddenly they're like, yup, I'm driving into a storm\\n\\nor there's something about to happen\\n\\nand I'm going to have to resist.\\n\\nI'm either going to have to do something\\n\\nor resist doing something,\\n\\nbut there's something activated inside of me.\\n\\nI think it's very important that we are all able\\n\\nto garner those resources and to activate those states\\n\\nwithin us voluntarily.\\n\\nBut I also know from experience and from observing others\\n\\nand indeed from the literature\\n\\non the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nas it relates to eating disorders\\n\\nand other aspects of neurologic and psychiatric challenges\\n\\nis that we also need to learn how to turn that off.\\n\\nWith that said, the little microsucks that we discussed,\\n\\nthe addition of a hundred jumping jacks\\n\\nat the end of a cardiovascular training session\\n\\nwhen you would much rather just shower up and go home.\\n\\nGetting into the cold shower or cold plunge\\n\\nwhen you absolutely don't want to do it,\\n\\nwell, provided you can do it safely,\\n\\nthat's going to be the best time to do it\\n\\nif your goal is to build up tenacity and willpower\\n\\nto say nothing else of the known benefits\\n\\nof things like deliberate cold exposure\\n\\nand exercise like jumping jacks, et cetera.\\n\\nThere are also entire landscapes of life and academics\\n\\nand sport that afford us the opportunity\\n\\nto build up tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nI, for instance, can recall taking my so-called\\n\\nqualifying exams in graduate school\\n\\nwhere they ask you questions until you say, I don't know,\\n\\nuntil you don't know the answer.\\n\\nIt's just like that puzzle in the Baumeister study.\\n\\nThey're taking you to the point\\n\\nwhere you basically can't win.\\n\\nAnd that turns out to be a very important lesson\\n\\nthat extends beyond the information\\n\\nthat they're asking you about.\\n\\nAnd of course, every student\\n\\nat the end of their qualifying exam runs off\\n\\nand figures out the answer to the question\\n\\nthat they couldn't get the right answer to.\\n\\nSometimes there is a right answer.\\n\\nSometimes they're not.\\n\\nIf the committee is pretty diabolical,\\n\\nthey'll give you an impossible to answer question\\n\\nbecause there's no answer.\\n\\nBut the point being that whether or not it's in martial arts,\\n\\nwhether or not it's in sports,\\n\\nwhether or not it's in music,\\n\\nwhether or not it's in academics,\\n\\nwhether or not it's in relating to others,\\n\\nthere is some value to getting to that point\\n\\nwhere you can't solve the puzzle.\\n\\nAnd I think that's an important message\\n\\nfor us to understand and maybe to incorporate\\n\\ninto our tools and protocols\\n\\nthat there are some endeavors that have no end point, right?\\n\\nThere's no winning.\\n\\nThere's no finish line.\\n\\nAnd those type of endeavors are extremely important,\\n\\nextremely important for continually building up\\n\\nour tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nSo much so that we can even take a somewhat 3000 mile view\\n\\nfrom the top down onto everything we've talked about today\\n\\nand think about those superagers.\\n\\nThose superagers that somehow are able to maintain\\n\\nthe cognitive function of a much younger person.\\n\\nAnd if you look at the data on superagers\\n\\nand people similar to them,\\n\\nyou'll find are always engaged\\n\\nin some activity that's hard for them.\\n\\nThey're always trying to learn something\\n\\nand they have a sort of playfulness about it,\\n\\nbut they seek out those friction points,\\n\\nboth resistance of certain behaviors, right?\\n\\nTrying to not do certain things,\\n\\nbut perhaps more often doing certain things,\\n\\nlearning a new skill, learning pottery, learning music,\\n\\nplacing themselves into novel environments\\n\\nthat are a little uncomfortable or a lot uncomfortable\\n\\nprovided that it's safe.\\n\\nSo from that standpoint,\\n\\none could even entertain the idea\\n\\nthat because these people are living much longer\\n\\nthan everybody else,\\n\\nin addition to maintaining the cognitive function\\n\\nof much younger individuals,\\n\\nthat perhaps the intermidsingulate cortex\\n\\nin its ability to allocate resources\\n\\nto different parts of our brain and body\\n\\nto meet certain motivational goals\\n\\nis actually associated with this thing\\n\\nthat we call the will to live.\\n\\nNow, the concept of the will to live\\n\\nis certainly getting a little bit squishy\\n\\nfor scientists like me who, yes,\\n\\nI'm happy to entertain discussions\\n\\nthat relate to psychological constructs\\n\\nsuch as tenacity and willpower,\\n\\nbut as you've probably noticed,\\n\\nI'm very comfortable with and very excited about the idea\\n\\nthat, okay, maybe it's related somehow\\n\\nto brain energetics and glucose, maybe not.\\n\\nCertainly, I'm on board the idea\\n\\nthat beliefs impact our physiology\\n\\nand physiology impacts our beliefs,\\n\\na la Dr. Ali Krum, who was a guest on this podcast previously,\\n\\ntalked about belief and mindset effects,\\n\\nwhich are very powerful.\\n\\nThey change our physiology literally\\n\\nand the DWEK data that we talked about today,\\n\\nbut of course also that there are brain areas\\n\\nand circuits that underlie these things\\n\\nthat we call tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nSo when we get into a discussion\\n\\nabout tenacity and willpower and then find ourselves,\\n\\nas we are now, talking about the will to live,\\n\\nI don't think it's going too far to say\\n\\nthat when one looks at the data on longevity,\\n\\nboth physical and psychological longevity,\\n\\nit's very clear that there are underlying\\n\\nphysiological explanations,\\n\\nnot the least of which is likely to be the maintenance,\\n\\nif not growth, over the lifespan\\n\\nof this anterior mid-singulate cortex,\\n\\nbut also that the people that are achieving that\\n\\nare continually foraging in their environment.\\n\\nThey're continually looking for new environments.\\n\\nThey're continually exploring.\\n\\nThey are not becoming complacent.\\n\\nThey are not becoming sedentary.\\n\\nThey are not existing down at that end of the continuum\\n\\nthat we call apathy and depression,\\n\\nbut that they're not existing down there.\\n\\nAnd they are existing up toward the end of the continuum\\n\\nthat we call tenacity and willpower\\n\\nand engaging motivation to get there.\\n\\nOkay, motivation, again, as a verb.\\n\\nBut in doing that, that they're reinforcing\\n\\nthe very circuits that give rise to tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nThis is what in engineering terms\\n\\nis referred to as a closed loop.\\n\\nIt's like you do A, which leads to B,\\n\\nwhich leads to C, which feeds back onto A\\n\\nand it makes A that much more likely to occur.\\n\\nIt's like turning the little A into a capital A\\n\\nand then turning into a boldface capital underline A,\\n\\nthe buildup of neural circuits.\\n\\nSo while today we focused a lot on an individual brain area,\\n\\nanterior mid-singulate cortex,\\n\\nand in many ways I presented it\\n\\nas if it's the be all end all of tenacity and willpower,\\n\\nit is not the be all end all of tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nIt's our ability to engage the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nthat allows us to express tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nBut in this closed loop fashion,\\n\\nit's our ability to express tenacity and willpower\\n\\nthat then feeds back onto that circuit\\n\\nand makes it more robust and more likely\\n\\nto be accessible in the future\\n\\nwhen we encounter something that we don't want to do\\n\\nor that we have to resist very strongly\\n\\nin order to not engage in some sort of behavior\\n\\nor thought pattern.\\n\\nSo the big takeaway is that if you want to increase\\n\\nyour tenacity and willpower, you absolutely can.\\n\\nYou can do that by triggering activation\\n\\nof this incredible hub within the brain,\\n\\nthe anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nfor which there is now a very large amount of evidence\\n\\nis at least central to the whole process\\n\\nof generating tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nI absolutely will do that.\\n\\nAnd the, no, I absolutely won't do that.\\n\\nIt's the resistance hub.\\n\\nIt's the thing that's allocating resources\\n\\nto do the thing that we don't want to do\\n\\nor that someone's trying to prevent us from doing.\\n\\nIt's also the brain area that's allowing us\\n\\nto resist doing the thing that we want to do\\n\\nor that someone else wants us to do\\n\\nwhen we decide that's not good for us.\\n\\nWe can really be certain based on the psychology literature,\\n\\nbased on the neuroscience literature,\\n\\nand really based on this beautiful literature\\n\\nthat's now emerging that includes the column study,\\n\\nbut some other studies as well\\n\\nthat perhaps we'll talk about in a future episode\\n\\nthat we really can build up our capacity\\n\\nfor tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nIt's a real thing.\\n\\nAnd as a final point to this,\\n\\nand indeed as a final protocol,\\n\\nI was very excited to look into the early release\\n\\nof peer-reviewed papers out from Neuron just this last week\\n\\nand to see that there was a study,\\n\\nalbeit in a preclinical model, in an animal model,\\n\\nthat explored what is called stress relief\\n\\nas a natural resilience mechanism.\\n\\nAnd I won't go into this study in full detail,\\n\\nespecially not now,\\n\\nlate into a slightly long episode such as this one.\\n\\nBut what the study showed is that\\n\\nwhen an animal is in a state of despair or a hedonia,\\n\\na lack of pleasure, when it's under stress,\\n\\nand then that stress is removed,\\n\\nthere's a sense of reward.\\n\\nThere's a sense of wellbeing\\n\\nthat accompanies that release of stress.\\n\\nAnd that's pretty obvious.\\n\\nThat's something that we've known about\\n\\nfor a very long time.\\n\\nBut what's interesting about this study,\\n\\nand they actually talk about this\\n\\nin terms of its applicability potentially to humans,\\n\\nis that when we are able to withstand a stress,\\n\\nmaybe that stress is school,\\n\\nmaybe that stress is a particular relationship.\\n\\nAgain, you never want to do these things\\n\\nin a way that's unhealthy or dangerous.\\n\\nBut when we are able to do that,\\n\\nthe relief that we feel afterwards\\n\\nis its own form of reward that serves to reinforce\\n\\nthat whole process of tenacity and willpower\\n\\nthat got us through the stressor.\\n\\nAnd an interesting thing about this study\\n\\nis that they went on to compound that reward.\\n\\nThey showed that rewarding oneself\\n\\nfor having gotten through a stressful episode\\n\\nactually serves to increase the capacity\\n\\nto get through stressful episodes in the future.\\n\\nIn other words, if you decide to develop certain tools\\n\\nand protocols to increase your levels of tenacity\\n\\nand willpower, which frankly,\\n\\nI hope that you will at least consider,\\n\\nagain, provided you do it safely,\\n\\nthis seems like a very good thing to do for all of us,\\n\\nespecially as we age.\\n\\nAnd guess what?\\n\\nWe're all aging from the time we're born.\\n\\nIf you decide to do that,\\n\\npick something that's challenging,\\n\\novercome that challenge.\\n\\nAgain, this could be the requirement\\n\\nto engage in a particular behavior when you don't want to\\n\\nor to resist a particular behavior\\n\\nthat you would otherwise want to engage in.\\n\\nBut also when you've successfully completed that resistance,\\n\\nwhen you've engaged that tenacity and willpower\\n\\nand you've activated that anterior mid-singulate cortex,\\n\\nwell then occasionally, not always,\\n\\nbut occasionally providing yourself with a reward\\n\\nof something that you like.\\n\\nAnd here it's highly subjective.\\n\\nYou'll just have to pick something that you like,\\n\\nagain, something that's hopefully health promoting,\\n\\nnot health diminishing,\\n\\ncan serve to further reinforce the behavior\\n\\nthat you just engaged in,\\n\\nwhich was to increase your tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nAnd if you listen to the episodes that I've done\\n\\non dopamine motivation and drive\\n\\nor on dopamine more generally,\\n\\nyou will know that I am not a fan\\n\\nof rewarding oneself for wins\\n\\nor for engaging tenacity or willpower for that matter\\n\\non a regular basis or certainly every time.\\n\\nThis is the sort of thing that just randomly\\n\\nevery once in a while when you've done the hard thing\\n\\nor if you've resisted the thing that was pulling on you\\n\\nthat you should reward yourself,\\n\\nbut of course reward yourself in healthy and safe ways.\\n\\nFor those of you that are interested in learning more\\n\\nabout how to reward the actions of tenacity and willpower,\\n\\nI'll provide a link to the recently published paper\\n\\nNeuron in the show note captions.\\n\\nI will also be doing a toolkit episode\\n\\nthat relates to what we covered today\\n\\nas well as some additional tools gleaned from other papers\\n\\nand resources in the not too distant future.\\n\\nThank you for joining me for today's discussion\\n\\nall about tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nWe talked about the idea gleaned from research\\n\\nin the field of psychology,\\n\\nthat tenacity and willpower are limited resources\\n\\nand that perhaps, again, perhaps they relate\\n\\nto this concept of ego depletion\\n\\nthat relates to this idea that what is depleted\\n\\nor what's limited in our ability to engage\\n\\ntenacity and willpower somehow relates to brain energetics\\n\\nand fuel consumption, namely glucose.\\n\\nI also talked about the conflicting data\\n\\nthat argues that if we believe tenacity and willpower\\n\\nare limited and that glucose is the thing that limits them,\\n\\nwell, then that's exactly what happens.\\n\\nSo I talked about that controversy\\n\\nand some of the data that actually reconcile\\n\\na bit of the differences there.\\n\\nSo in the absence of new data,\\n\\nyou'll have to decide for yourself what you believe\\n\\nabout tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nHowever, it's very important to acknowledge\\n\\nthe universal truth, which is that our tenacity\\n\\nand willpower rides on the tide of autonomic function.\\n\\nThat is when we are sleep deprived,\\n\\nwhen we are in pain, when we are in emotional pain,\\n\\nor when we are distracted,\\n\\nour tenacity and willpower is diminished,\\n\\nwhich calls upon all of us to make sure\\n\\nthat we're taking care of our autonomic functions\\n\\nthrough viewing morning sunlight, getting sufficient sleep,\\n\\nadequate nutrition, social connections,\\n\\nthings that I've covered extensively on previous episodes.\\n\\nThen we talked about the neural underpinnings\\n\\nof tenacity and willpower\\n\\nand this absolutely incredible brain structure\\n\\nthat we'll call a hub,\\n\\nbecause it's not operating in isolation,\\n\\nbut rather it's getting inputs\\n\\nfrom lots of different brain areas relate to reward,\\n\\nexecutive function, autonomic function,\\n\\nmotor planning, goal seeking, et cetera,\\n\\nthat we call the anterior mid-singulate cortex,\\n\\nthis phenomenally interesting brain area\\n\\nthat seems to be able to generate this thing\\n\\nthat we call tenacity and willpower\\n\\nand that when we engage or express tenacity and willpower\\n\\nby doing the thing that we least want to do,\\n\\nby not doing the thing that we most want to do\\n\\nin a given moment,\\n\\nthat we actually can build up our anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nand thereby build up our future capacity\\n\\nto engage the anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nwhen we need to call on tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nAnd then we talked about some of the peer-reviewed data\\n\\nthat shows how that actually can be done,\\n\\nwhere these individuals who were not previously exercising\\n\\ndid a challenging three one-hour sessions per week\\n\\nof cardiovascular training\\n\\nand indeed their anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nand the connections to and away from it\\n\\nincreased in a way that set them apart\\n\\nfrom their age-related cohorts.\\n\\nThat is their brains stayed younger,\\n\\nmaybe even got younger,\\n\\nwhereas those that did not do the hard thing, right?\\n\\nThat didn't engage tenacity and willpower\\n\\ndid not experience the same effect.\\n\\nAnd then we talked about how those data could be extended\\n\\ninto a number of different realms,\\n\\nsuch as cognitive learning, learning languages,\\n\\nlearning math, learning art,\\n\\nlearning any number of different things\\n\\nor in the physical realm,\\n\\nengaging in certain types of exercise\\n\\nthat one is not already engaging in,\\n\\nadding in a little bit of additional exercise,\\n\\nspecifically at a time in which you least want to do that\\n\\nor extending your fasting period,\\n\\nif that's something that you're doing\\n\\nand that you can do healthfully,\\n\\nsimply because it allows you to exercise\\n\\nyour anterior mid-singulate cortex,\\n\\nAKA tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nAnd of course, we highlighted that all of that\\n\\nneeds to be done in the context of psychological\\n\\nand physical safety.\\n\\nWe don't want anyone to do things\\n\\nthat are going to be physically damaging to themselves.\\n\\nBut if one simply takes the stance of,\\n\\nokay, what's something that I can do in a moment\\n\\nthat will allow me to build up tenacity and willpower?\\n\\nWell, it's going to be the thing\\n\\nthat I least want to do in that moment\\n\\nor the thing that I least want to resist doing\\n\\nin that moment, to periodically add in those little,\\n\\nwhat I refer to as micro-sucks,\\n\\na very non-scientific, frankly, non-psychological term,\\n\\nbut I think we all understand what it means.\\n\\nLittle things that we don't want to do,\\n\\nbut that if we do them,\\n\\nyou can be sure that you're activating\\n\\nthe anterior mid-singulate cortex\\n\\nand thereby increasing the probability,\\n\\nthe likelihood that you can access tenacity and willpower\\n\\nmore readily in the future.\\n\\nSo what I've done today is explain the scientific studies\\n\\nin the realm of psychology and neuroscience\\n\\nthat explain what tenacity and willpower are\\n\\nand what allows us to build up our tenacity\\n\\nand willpower over time.\\n\\nAnd then it's really up to all of us,\\n\\nto you and to me and everybody else\\n\\nto figure out in which particular domains\\n\\nand with which frequency we're going to decide\\n\\nto build up our tenacity and willpower.\\n\\nSo it's clear that tenacity and willpower\\n\\nare not just resources that we need to call upon\\n\\nfrom time to time in order to overcome things,\\n\\nbut then indeed calling on our ability\\n\\nand building up our ability for tenacity and willpower\\n\\ncan allow us a much richer enjoyment of life\\n\\nand perhaps can even extend our life\\n\\nby engaging the will to live.\\n\\nThank you for joining me for

       " Document(page_content=\"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\n\\nwhere we discuss science\\n\\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\\n\\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\\n\\nand I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology\\n\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\n\\nToday, we're discussing alcohol,\\n\\none of the most commonly consumed substances\\n\\non the planet Earth.\\n\\nShe mentioned that both humans\\n\\nand non-human animals consume alcohol,\\n\\neither for recreational purposes,\\n\\nbecause they like the feeling that it gives them,\\n\\nor for medicinal purposes,\\n\\nor for other purposes that we'll discuss.\\n\\nWe are, of course, going to discuss the effects of alcohol\\n\\non our biology,\\n\\nranging from its effects on individual cells,\\n\\non organs and organ systems in our brain and body.\\n\\nWe are also going to discuss\\n\\nthe effects of the effects of alcohol.\\n\\nThat is what being inebriated really does\\n\\nto our thinking and our behavior and how it does it.\\n\\nAnd we are going to address\\n\\nwhat seems to be one of the more common questions out there,\\n\\nwhich is whether or not low to moderate amounts of drinking\\n\\nare better for our health\\n\\nthan zero alcohol consumption at all.\\n\\nAnd of course, we will talk about severe alcohol intake,\\n\\nbinge drinking.\\n\\nWe will also talk about hangover\\n\\nand what science says about ways\\n\\nto reduce the effects of hangover,\\n\\neither by doing things that are inoculatory,\\n\\nmeaning before you drink or while you drink,\\n\\nas well as things to do if you happen to have a hangover.\\n\\nWe will discuss some of the genetic differences\\n\\nfor alcohol and alcoholism.\\n\\nAnd we will discuss alcohol consumption in young people\\n\\nand how that can be especially detrimental\\n\\nfor reasons that I think are going to be quite surprising\\n\\nto most of you.\\n\\nMy goal is that by the end of today's episode,\\n\\nyou will have a thorough understanding\\n\\nof what alcohol does to your brain and body,\\n\\nand that you will be able to make informed decisions\\n\\nas to whether or not you should be consuming zero,\\n\\nabsolutely no alcohol, small to moderate amounts of alcohol.\\n\\nAnd again, we'll define exactly what that means,\\n\\nsmall to moderate amounts.\\n\\nAnd if you or somebody else that you know\\n\\nis consuming excessive amounts of alcohol\\n\\nthat are clearly detrimental to your health,\\n\\nsome of the better routes and resources that you can use\\n\\nin order to remove that dependence and or consumption.\\n\\nI'd like to preface all of that\\n\\nby saying that today's discussion is really geared\\n\\ntoward giving you information.\\n\\nIt is not about judging alcohol intake\\n\\nor lack of alcohol intake.\\n\\nI just want you to be able to make the most informed decision\\n\\nabout alcohol possible.\\n\\nI'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab podcast\\n\\nis now partnered with Momentus Supplements.\\n\\nWe partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.\\n\\nFirst of all, they ship internationally\\n\\nbecause we know that many of you are located\\n\\noutside of the United States.\\n\\nSecond of all, and perhaps most important,\\n\\nthe quality of their supplements is second to none,\\n\\nboth in terms of purity and precision\\n\\nof the amounts of the ingredients.\\n\\nThird, we've really emphasized supplements\\n\\nthat are single ingredient supplements\\n\\nand that are supplied in dosages\\n\\nthat allow you to build a supplementation protocol\\n\\nthat's optimized for cost,\\n\\nthat's optimized for effectiveness,\\n\\nand that you can add things and remove things\\n\\nfrom your protocol in a way\\n\\nthat's really systematic and scientific.\\n\\nIf you'd like to see the supplements\\n\\nthat we partnered with Momentus on,\\n\\nyou can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nThere you'll see those supplements,\\n\\nand just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding\\n\\nthe library of supplements available through Momentus\\n\\non a regular basis.\\n\\nAgain, that's livemomentus.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nBefore we get into today's content in detail,\\n\\nI just want to answer a commonly asked question\\n\\nabout alcohol consumption and the brain.\\n\\nAnd the question that so often comes up\\n\\nis whether or not low to moderate amounts of alcohol,\\n\\nso maybe one drink a day\\n\\nor one or two drinks a day kind of thing,\\n\\nwhether or not that is bad for your brain,\\n\\nin particular, whether or not it causes degeneration\\n\\nof neurons or nerve cells.\\n\\nNow, the reason that question comes up so often\\n\\nis because for many years,\\n\\nit's been known that high levels of alcohol consumption,\\n\\nso 12 to 24 drinks per week or more,\\n\\nis certainly causing neurodegeneration,\\n\\nin particular of the so-called neocortex,\\n\\nthe outer layers of the brain\\n\\nthat house associative memories,\\n\\nthat house our ability to think and plan,\\n\\nthat house our ability to regulate our more primitive drives\\n\\naccording to context, et cetera.\\n\\nSo to make very clear, drinking a lot,\\n\\nso having three or four drinks per night\\n\\nevery night of the week is clearly bad for the brain.\\n\\nA recent study, however,\\n\\nfinally addressed the question of whether or not\\n\\nlow to moderate amounts of alcohol consumption\\n\\ncan cause brain degeneration.\\n\\nThe title of the study is\\n\\nAssociations Between Alcohol Consumption\\n\\nand Gray and White Matter Volumes in the UK Biobank,\\n\\nthe United Kingdom Biobank.\\n\\nFirst of all, gray matter are the neurons,\\n\\nit's the so-called cell bodies\\n\\nthat house the genome of the cells, et cetera,\\n\\nand white matter is the connections, the fibers,\\n\\nthe so-called axons of neurons,\\n\\nand it's called white matter\\n\\nbecause that tissue is surrounded by a fatty tissue\\n\\ncalled myelin, which allows nerve cells\\n\\nto communicate with each other very quickly.\\n\\nSo what this study did is it looked at the brains,\\n\\nboth the gray matter and the white matter,\\n\\nof more than 30,000, indeed more than 35,000,\\n\\ngenerally healthy middle-aged and older adults\\n\\nin the United Kingdom\\n\\nwho were drinking various amounts of alcohol.\\n\\nWhat they found was that even for people\\n\\nthat were drinking low to moderate amounts of alcohol,\\n\\nso one or two drinks per day,\\n\\nthere was evidence of thinning of the neocortex,\\n\\nso loss of neurons in the neocortex and other brain regions.\\n\\nAnd I don't say this in order to cause alarm,\\n\\nI tell you this because they are important data\\n\\nbecause they reveal and indeed answer the question\\n\\nthat has been burning for so long\\n\\nwhether or not chronic alcohol intake\\n\\ncan disrupt the brain,\\n\\neven if the chronic intake is very low.\\n\\nNow we should talk about what the word chronic means\\n\\nbecause many people, when they hear the word chronic,\\n\\nthink high levels of whatever intake, okay?\\n\\nSo they think five drinks a night or 10 drinks a night\\n\\nor people drinking every night.\\n\\nNow in this study, they looked at people who on average\\n\\nwere drinking one or two drinks per night.\\n\\nSo that could be 14 drinks on the weekend,\\n\\nit could be one drink per night,\\n\\nit could be seven drinks on Friday.\\n\\nIn other words, on average, one or two drinks per night.\\n\\nAnd I think many people out there are drinking\\n\\nsomewhere between one and two drinks per night\\n\\nor day of the week on average.\\n\\nSo that would be seven to 14 drinks per week.\\n\\nSo this is an important study because it says\\n\\nthat if you're consuming even just seven glasses of wine\\n\\nacross the week, it's likely that there is going to be\\n\\nsome degeneration of your brain\\n\\nin response to that alcohol intake.\\n\\nAlthough, as mentioned earlier,\\n\\nwe will talk about some of the things that can inoculate\\n\\nagainst some of that neuronal loss.\\n\\nFor those of you that are interested in reading the study\\n\\nin more detail, we've put a link to it\\n\\nin the show note captions.\\n\\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast\\n\\nis separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.\\n\\nIt is however, part of my desire and effort\\n\\nto bring zero cost to consumer information about science\\n\\nand science related tools to the general public.\\n\\nIn keeping with that theme,\\n\\nI'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.\\n\\nOur first sponsor is Levels.\\n\\nLevels is a program that lets you see\\n\\nhow different foods affect your health\\n\\nby giving you real-time feedback on your diet\\n\\nusing a continuous glucose monitor.\\n\\nOne of the most important features\\n\\nof our immediate feelings of wellbeing\\n\\nand our ability to focus and think and move and have energy\\n\\nas well as our long-term health are our blood glucose levels.\\n\\nThat is our blood sugar levels.\\n\\nAnd that's because all the cells and tissues of our body\\n\\nand especially neurons, nerve cells,\\n\\nrely on glucose for fuel.\\n\\nI realize some of you out there are ketogenic\\n\\nand yes, you can use ketones for fuel,\\n\\nbut the vast majority of people are using glucose\\n\\nfor fuel in their cells.\\n\\nIf you want to maintain energy and focus throughout the day,\\n\\nyou want to keep that blood glucose steady\\n\\nand you don't want it ever to spike or to drop too much.\\n\\nSo you need to understand how different foods\\n\\nand indeed how different activities\\n\\nimpact your blood glucose.\\n\\nI started using Levels about a year ago\\n\\nas a way to understand how different foods\\n\\nand exercise and supplements and combinations of food\\n\\nand exercise and even sequencing, like when I do what,\\n\\nhow that affects my blood glucose levels.\\n\\nIt's been tremendously informative.\\n\\nIt's completely reshaped when I exercise, how I exercise,\\n\\nwhen I eat relative to exercise, et cetera.\\n\\nSo if you're interested in learning more about Levels\\n\\nand trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself,\\n\\ngo to levels.link slash Huberman.\\n\\nAgain, that's levels.link slash Huberman.\\n\\nToday's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.\\n\\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling,\\n\\nheating and sleep tracking capacity.\\n\\nI've talked many times on the podcast about the fact\\n\\nthat getting a great night's sleep is the foundation\\n\\nof mental health, physical health\\n\\nand all forms of performance.\\n\\nAnd one of the key variables in getting a great night's sleep\\n\\nis making sure that your sleeping environment\\n\\nis the right temperature.\\n\\nIndeed, your brain and body have to drop\\n\\nby one to three degrees in order to get into sleep\\n\\nand to stay in deep sleep throughout the night.\\n\\nIf your room is too hot or if you're running too warm,\\n\\nyou will wake up.\\n\\nIn fact, that is why you wake up in the morning.\\n\\nWith Eight Sleep, you can adjust the temperature\\n\\nof your mattress and your overall sleeping environment\\n\\nand customize that to you.\\n\\nI started using Eight Sleep some time ago\\n\\nand it's just been a total game changer.\\n\\nI program mine so that there's a subtle drop\\n\\nin the temperature of my mattress\\n\\nat the beginning of the night\\n\\nand then it gets progressively cooler\\n\\nand then it heats up toward morning.\\n\\nEven has this nice little vibrate feature.\\n\\nSo it wakes me up by vibrating the mattress a little bit.\\n\\nAnd of course that mattress is warming\\n\\nand warming is the way that we wake up.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try Eight Sleep,\\n\\ngo to eightsleep.com slash Huberman,\\n\\ncheck out their pro prod cover\\n\\nand save up

episode is also brought to us by Roca.\\n\\nRoca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\\n\\nthat are of the absolute highest quality\\n\\nand they also have some unique characteristics.\\n\\nThe company was founded by two all-American swimmers\\n\\nfrom Stanford and everything about Roca eyeglasses\\n\\nand sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.\\n\\nRoca eyeglasses and sunglasses can be worn while running\\n\\nor cycling.\\n\\nIf you get sweaty, they won't fall off your face\\n\\nand they're extremely lightweight.\\n\\nIn fact, most of the time,\\n\\nI can't even remember that I'm wearing them.\\n\\nI wear Roca eyeglasses when I read at night,\\n\\nso I wear their readers\\n\\nand I wear sunglasses at various times throughout the day.\\n\\nThe great thing about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses\\n\\nis that even though they were designed\\n\\nfor athletic performance, they have a terrific aesthetic.\\n\\nSo unlike a lot of so-called performance glasses\\n\\nthat make people look like cyborgs, in my opinion,\\n\\nRoca eyeglasses and sunglasses are the sort\\n\\nthat you could wear out to dinner,\\n\\nthat you could wear to work.\\n\\nThey have a terrific aesthetic.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,\\n\\nyou can go to roca, that's R-O-K-A.com\\n\\nand enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order.\\n\\nAgain, that's roca, R-O-K-A.com\\n\\nand enter the code Huberman at checkout.\\n\\nLet's talk about alcohol.\\n\\nAnd let's just acknowledge that human beings\\n\\nhave been consuming alcohol for thousands of years.\\n\\nIf you look at the archeological evidence from Mesopotamia,\\n\\nyou'll find that 5,000 years ago, people had wine vessels.\\n\\nOr if you want to know\\n\\nwhen people first started distilling alcohol,\\n\\nmuch to people's surprise,\\n\\nthat did not first take place in Ireland.\\n\\nAnd that's not a joke about the Irish,\\n\\nthat you'll see a lot of claims online\\n\\nthat the Irish were the first to distill alcohol,\\n\\nbut in fact, they were not.\\n\\nIt was the Chinese that were the first to distill alcohol.\\n\\nAnd that took place in China in the first century.\\n\\nAlcohol has been used for nutritional purposes.\\n\\nSo there are cultures that believe,\\n\\nand indeed still believe,\\n\\nthat the calories in alcohol are useful,\\n\\nalthough later we'll talk about how alcohol calories\\n\\nare indeed empty calories\\n\\nand what an empty calorie really is, why it's called empty.\\n\\nAlcohol has been used for medicinal purposes\\n\\nbecause indeed it does kill bacteria.\\n\\nAnd as you'll soon find out, the fact that it kills bacteria\\n\\nbecause that is absolutely true,\\n\\nit also kills the good bacteria in your gut\\n\\nand the destruction of that good bacteria in your gut\\n\\ncan lead to things like leaky gut syndrome\\n\\nand has all sorts of issues\\n\\nand there are ways to deal with those issues\\n\\nand we'll talk about those.\\n\\nSo alcohol has been used for medicinal purposes.\\n\\nIt's been used to clean surfaces.\\n\\nIt's used in my laboratory in order to make up\\n\\nso-called reagents to do our experiments.\\n\\nBut most humans have been consuming alcohol\\n\\nin order to change their internal state,\\n\\nin order to feel differently than they would otherwise.\\n\\nThat feeling of being drunk or inebriated\\n\\nor tipsy or lightheaded is something that many, not all,\\n\\nbut many humans seem to enjoy and pursue,\\n\\neven though typically it leads to a feeling\\n\\nof being less happy, less motivated, more stressed, et cetera,\\n\\nwhen the alcohol wears off.\\n\\nThat's pretty incredible, right?\\n\\nI mean, we're talking about a substance\\n\\nthat people have been highly motivated to pursue\\n\\nthat are still highly motivated to pursue,\\n\\nto create and to consume, that they'll spend money on.\\n\\nAnd that's despite the fact that it makes them feel good\\n\\nand then it makes them feel lousy.\\n\\nNow, some of you might be saying,\\n\\nwell, I drink, but I don't drink to excess\\n\\nand therefore I don't feel lousy.\\n\\nI feel good when I drink and then it wears off\\n\\nand it allows me to get through my evening\\n\\nand then the next morning I'm ready to go.\\n\\nOkay, that very well may be true.\\n\\nI believe those people.\\n\\nAnd as I mentioned at the beginning of the episode,\\n\\nI'm not here to demonize alcohol in any way,\\n\\nbut I do want to point out what alcohol is\\n\\nand how it creates the effects that it does.\\n\\nAnd then I want to talk about what those effects are\\n\\nwhen you engage in consuming alcohol,\\n\\neven as often as one or two nights per week,\\n\\nor let's say you're just somebody who has a drink\\n\\nor two on Friday, maybe a few more on Saturday,\\n\\nor maybe you're somebody who consumes all your alcohol\\n\\none night per week or one night per month.\\n\\nWe'll talk about how that's affecting your biology.\\n\\nSo let's address what alcohol is\\n\\nand how it affects the cells and tissues\\n\\nand organs of your body.\\n\\nThen we'll take a look at some of the epidemiology,\\n\\nthat is how many people are consuming alcohol\\n\\nand how much they're drinking.\\n\\nAnd then you'll be able, I think,\\n\\nto get a good sense of how the alcohol that you're drinking,\\n\\nif you're drinking any at all,\\n\\nis impacting your brain and body\\n\\nand the choices you might want to make\\n\\nabout how and when to drink alcohol,\\n\\nor even if you want to eliminate alcohol altogether.\\n\\nOkay, so some basic chemistry and biology of alcohol.\\n\\nAnd again, I'll make this very clear.\\n\\nEven if you don't have a chemistry and biology background,\\n\\nbecause of the structure of alcohol,\\n\\nit is what's called both water-soluble and fat-soluble.\\n\\nTranslated into what's meaningful for you,\\n\\nwhat that means is when you drink alcohol,\\n\\nit can pass into all the cells and tissues of your body.\\n\\nIt has no trouble just passing right into those cells.\\n\\nSo unlike a lot of substances and drugs\\n\\nthat actually attach to the surface of cells,\\n\\nto receptors, as they're called, little parking spots,\\n\\nand then trigger a bunch of downstreams,\\n\\nlike domino cascades of effects,\\n\\nalcohol actually has its own direct effects on cells\\n\\nbecause it can really just pass into those cells.\\n\\nSo it's water and fat-soluble.\\n\\nAnd the fact that it can pass into so many organs and cells\\n\\nso easily is really what explains its damaging effects.\\n\\nI should mention that there are three main types of alcohol.\\n\\nThere's isopropyl, methyl, and ethyl alcohol.\\n\\nAnd only the last one, ethyl alcohol or ethanol,\\n\\nis fit for human consumption.\\n\\nHowever, it is still toxic, okay?\\n\\nIt produces substantial stress and damage to cells.\\n\\nI'd love to be able to tell you otherwise,\\n\\nbut that's just a fact.\\n\\nEthanol produces substantial damage to cells.\\n\\nAnd it does that because when you ingest ethanol,\\n\\nit has to be converted into something else\\n\\nbecause it is toxic to the body.\\n\\nAnd there's a molecule inside of all of us called NAD,\\n\\nand you may have heard of NAD because it's quite popular.\\n\\nThere's a lot of discussion about NAD\\n\\nin the longevity literature right now.\\n\\nNAD is present in all our cells from birth until death.\\n\\nThe levels of NAD tend to go down across the lifespan.\\n\\nThere are ideas that increasing levels of NAD\\n\\nmay extend lifespan.\\n\\nA lot of that is still controversial,\\n\\nor at least we should say is ongoing\\n\\nin terms of the research.\\n\\nBut nonetheless, when you ingest ethanol,\\n\\nNAD and related biochemical pathways\\n\\nare involved in converting that ethanol\\n\\ninto something called acetylaldehyde.\\n\\nIt's broken down into acetylaldehyde.\\n\\nAnd if you thought ethanol was bad,\\n\\nacetylaldehyde is particularly bad.\\n\\nAcetylaldehyde is poison.\\n\\nIt will kill cells.\\n\\nIt damages and kills cells, and it is indiscriminate\\n\\nas to which cells it damages and kills.\\n\\nNow, that's a problem, obviously,\\n\\nand the body deals with that problem\\n\\nby using another component of the NAD biochemical pathway\\n\\nto convert acetylaldehyde into something called acetate.\\n\\nAcetate is actually something\\n\\nthat your body can use as fuel.\\n\\nAnd that process of going from ethanol to acetylaldehyde\\n\\nto acetate does involve the production\\n\\nof a toxic molecule, right?\\n\\nAgain, acetylaldehyde is really toxic.\\n\\nAnd NAD, and if we want to get technical,\\n\\nit's the NAD to NADH ratio.\\n\\nAnd that chemical step is the rate-limiting step\\n\\nto ethanol's metabolism.\\n\\nWhat does that mean for you?\\n\\nWhat that means is that if your body can't do\\n\\nthis conversion of ethanol to acetylaldehyde\\n\\nto acetate fast enough,\\n\\nwell, acetylaldehyde will build up in your body\\n\\nand cause more damage.\\n\\nSo it's important that your body be able\\n\\nto do this conversion very quickly.\\n\\nAnd the place where it does that is within the liver.\\n\\nAnd cells within the liver are very good\\n\\nat this conversion process.\\n\\nBut they are cells, and they are exposed\\n\\nto the acetylaldehyde in the conversion process.\\n\\nAnd so cells within the liver really take a beating\\n\\nin the alcohol metabolism events.\\n\\nSo the key thing to understand here\\n\\nis that when you ingest alcohol,\\n\\nyou are, yes, ingesting a poison,\\n\\nand that poison is converted\\n\\ninto an even worse poison in your body.\\n\\nAnd some percentage of that worst poison\\n\\nis converted into a form of calories\\n\\nthat you can use to generate energy, generate ATP.\\n\\nAnd the reason why alcohol is considered empty calories\\n\\nis because that entire process is very metabolically costly,\\n\\nbut there's no real nutritive value\\n\\nof the calories that it creates.\\n\\nYou can use it for immediate energy,\\n\\nbut it can't be stored in any kind of meaningful\\n\\nor beneficial way.\\n\\nIt doesn't provide any vitamins.\\n\\nIt doesn't provide any amino acids.\\n\\nIt doesn't provide any fatty acids.\\n\\nIt's truly empty calories.\\n\\nI know some people talk about sugar is empty calories,\\n\\nbut sugar actually is a far better fuel source\\n\\nthan alcohol or acetate.\\n\\nBut nonetheless, when you ingest alcohol,\\n\\nsome percentage is being shuttled into a worse poison\\n\\nand some is being shuttled into a fuel source.\\n\\nNow, the important thing to understand\\n\\nis that it is the poison, the acetal aldehyde itself,\\n\\nthat leads to the effect of being inebriated or drunk.\\n\\nI think most people don't realize that,\\n\\nthat being drunk is actually a poison-induced disruption\\n\\nin the way that your neural circuits work.\\n\\nAnd so we should ask ourselves\\n\\nwhich neural circuits, what brain areas,\\n\\nwhat body areas involved in feeling drunk or inebriated.\\n\\nNow, in thinking about this state of being tipsy or happy\\n\\nor really drunk or a little bit drunk,\\n\\nI want to mention something\\n\\nI think most people aren't aware of.\\n\\nAnd that's the fact that for people that are regular drinkers\\n\\nor that have a genetic predisposition to alcoholism,\\n\\nwhen they drink, they tend to feel very energized\\n\\nand very good for longer periods of time.\\n\\nAgain, people who have a genetic predisposition to alcohol\\n\\nor people who are chronic drinkers or even just,\\n\\nif you recall, chronic doesn't have to mean a ton of alcohol\\n\\nbut they're drinking one or two per night\\n\\nor they're every other night type drinkers\\n\\nor Thursday through Sunday drinkers.\\n\\nThose people typically experience an increase\\n\\nin alertness and mood when they drink,\\n\\nwhereas occasional drinkers will have a briefer,\\n\\nmeaning less long-lasting period\\n\\nof feeling good when they drink\\n\\nand then more quickly transition into a state\\n\\nin which they're tired or they start losing motor skills,\\n\\nthey start slurring their speech.\\n\\nI also want to emphasize this is distinct from tolerance.\\n\\nWe'll talk about tolerance later\\n\\nand exactly what tolerance means.\\n\\nBut I really want to highlight the fact\\n\\nthat when people ingest this poison,\\n\\nbecause indeed it is poison,\\n\\nthe range of effects is very different\\n\\nand you can reliably predict who are the people\\n\\nwith a predisposition to alcoholism\\n\\nand who are the people who are more regular drinkers\\n\\nby the contour, the timing of the different effects.\\n\\nAnd again, people who tend to feel more alert\\n\\nand excited every time they drink,\\n\\nthey tend to get a real lift.\\n\\nThey become kind of the life of the party\\n\\nand that lasts a long while.\\n\\nThose people are the ones that really have to be careful\\n\\nabout predisposition for alcoholism.\\n\\nAnd those people also need to be careful\\n\\nabout their drinking and the amount of drinking\\n\\nthat they're doing,\\n\\neven if they're not full-blown alcoholics.\\n\\nNow, of course, people who are ingesting alcohol,\\n\\nwho are not accustomed to drink alcohol\\n\\nhave to be concerned about drinking alcohol\\n\\nfor other reasons,\\n\\nbecause it can impair motor function and judgment, et cetera.\\n\\nBut in thinking about the biochemical effects of alcohol\\n\\nand what it's doing to the body,\\n\\nwhat it's doing in all cases is it's consumed into the gut,\\n\\ngoes into the stomach.\\n\\nThe liver immediately starts this conversion\\n\\nthat we talked about before\\n\\nof ethanol to acetaldehyde to acetate.\\n\\nAnd some amount of acetaldehyde and acetate\\n\\nare making it into the brain.\\n\\nIt crosses the blood-brain barrier.\\n\\nAgain, the brain has this fence around it\\n\\nthat we call the blood-brain barrier or the BBB.\\n\\nMany things, most things, thankfully,\\n\\ncan't pass across the blood-brain barrier,\\n\\nbut alcohol, because it's water and fat soluble,\\n\\njust cruises right across this fence\\n\\nand into the milieu, the environment of the brain,\\n\\nwhich is made up of a couple of different major cell types,\\n\\nneurons, nerve cells, and so-called glial cells,\\n\\nwhich are in between the nerve cells.\\n\\nAnd we'll talk about the effects on each of those soon.\\n\\nSo what happens when alcohol gets into the brain\\n\\nthat makes us feel tipsy or drunk,\\n\\nand in some people makes people feel really,\\n\\nespecially energized and happy?\\n\\nWell, alcohol is indiscriminate\\n\\nin terms of which brain areas it goes to.\\n\\nAgain, it doesn't bind to particular receptors,\\n\\nbut it does seem to have a propensity or an affinity\\n\\nfor particular brain areas that are involved\\n\\nin certain kinds of thinking and behavior.\\n\\nSo one of the first things that happens\\n\\nis that there's a slight,\\n\\nat least after the first drink or second drink,\\n\\nthere's a slight suppression in the activity of neurons\\n\\nin the prefrontal cortex.\\n\\nThis is an area of your neocortex\\n\\nthat's involved in thinking and planning,\\n\\nand perhaps above all, in suppression of impulsive behavior.\\n\\nSo if you go to a party and they're serving alcohol\\n\\nand people are consuming drinks,\\n\\nwhat you'll notice is that a few minutes into that party,\\n\\nthe volume of people's voices will increase.\\n\\nAnd that's because people are simply not paying attention\\n\\nto their voice modulation.\\n\\nAs other people start speaking more loudly,\\n\\nother people are speaking more loudly.\\n\\nWe've all had this experience of going to a party\\n\\nand then you step outside for a moment and you go,\\n\\noh my goodness, I was shouting.\\n\\nYou come home the next day, you've got a sore throat.\\n\\nIt might be that you picked up some sort of bug,\\n\\nsome virus or something,\\n\\nbut oftentimes it's just the fact\\n\\nyou've been shouting all night just to be heard\\n\\nbecause as the prefrontal cortex shuts down,\\n\\npeople stop modulating their level of speech quite as much.\\n\\nAlso notice that people start gesticulating more.\\n\\nPeople will start standing up and sitting down more.\\n\\nThey'll start walking around more.\\n\\nIf there's music on,\\n\\npeople might spontaneously start dancing.\\n\\nAll of this is because these areas\\n\\nof the prefrontal cortex normally are providing\\n\\nwhat's called top-down inhibition.\\n\\nThey are releasing a neurotransmitter called GABA\\n\\nonto various parts of the brain.\\n\\nThey're involved in impulsive motor behavior\\n\\nand thought patterns.\\n\\nAnd as you shut down the prefrontal cortex,\\n\\nthat GABA-ergic suppression of impulses\\n\\nstarts to be released.\\n\\nSo people will say things that they want to say\\n\\nwithout so much forethought about what they're saying.\\n\\nOr they might do things that they want to do\\n\\nwithout really thinking it through quite as much\\n\\nor they might not even remember thinking it through at all\\n\\nor experience, I should say, thinking it through at all.\\n\\nWe haven't talked about blacking out yet\\n\\nand the effects of alcohol on memory.\\n\\nBut as long as we're there,\\n\\nI'll just tell you that alcohol has a very strong effect\\n\\nin suppressing the neural networks\\n\\nthat are involved in memory formation and storage.\\n\\nThis is why oftentimes we forget the events\\n\\nof a night out if we've been drinking.\\n\\nOne of the more important things to know\\n\\nabout the effects of alcohol in the brain\\n\\nis this disruption in top-down inhibition,\\n\\nbut also that areas of the brain\\n\\nthat are involved in flexible behavior,\\n\\nsort of considering different options.\\n\\nLike I could do A or I could do B.\\n\\nI could say this to them or I could say that.\\n\\nI could say it in that way or I could say it in this way.\\n\\nThis might be a little more tactful.\\n\\nThose brain areas basically shut down entirely\\n\\nand people just tend to say what they want to say.\\n\\nSo the key thing to understand is that when people drink,\\n\\nthe prefrontal cortex and top-down inhibition is diminished.\\n\\nThat is habitual behavior\\n\\nand impulsive behavior starts to increase.\\n\\nNow, what's interesting is this is true in the short term.\\n\\nSo after people have one or two,\\n\\nmaybe three or four drinks,\\n\\nbut it's also true that the more often that people drink,\\n\\nthere are changes in the very circuits\\n\\nthat underlie habitual and impulsive behavior.\\n\\nOkay, this is really important to highlight\\n\\nso much so that I want to drill into it\\n\\na little bit more deeply.\\n\\nFor the person that drinks say every Thursday night\\n\\nor every Friday night or goes out only on Saturdays,\\n\\nbut every Saturday,\\n\\nthere's evidence that there are changes\\n\\nin the neural circuits of the brain\\n\\nthat control habitual behavior and impulsive behavior.\\n\\nAnd they are modified and strengthened\\n\\nin ways that make those people more habitual\\n\\nand more impulsive outside the times\\n\\nin which they are drinking.\\n\\nAnd when they drink,\\n\\nimpulsive and habitual behavior\\n\\ntends to increase even further.\\n\\nThis is something that's not often talked about\\n\\nwhen discussing the effects of alcohol.\\n\\nAnd we all know the effects of being drunk can be bad,\\n\\ncan be bad in terms of judgment, motor coordination,\\n\\ncertainly driving drunk is a terrible thing,\\n\\nget you or other people killed and so on.\\n\\nBut rarely do we hear about the changes in neural circuits\\n\\nfrom just one or two nights of regular drinking.\\n\\nAgain, chronic drinking doesn't necessarily mean\\n\\nevery day and every night.\\n\\nIt could be the person that simply drinks every Thursday\\n\\nor every Friday or just once a week\\n\\nhas three or four drinks or maybe even a few more.\\n\\nThat person is going to experience a decrease\\n\\nin this top-down inhibition.\\n\\nSo an increase in impulsivity and habitual behavior\\n\\nbecause the break on those behaviors\\n\\nhas been removed while they're drinking,\\n\\nbut also changes in the very neural circuits\\n\\nthat allow habitual and impulsive behavior\\n\\nto occur more readily even when they're not drinking.\\n\\nAnd if you want to know the actual substrate for that,\\n\\nthe seller substrate, I can briefly describe it.\\n\\nIt's really interesting.\\n\\nAgain, you don't need to know any biology\\n\\nto understand this.\\n\\nWhat it does is it increases the number of synapses,\\n\\nthe actual points of connection in the neural circuits\\n\\nthat control habitual behavior.\\n\\nSo there's literally a growth of the neural circuits\\n\\nin your brain that lead to existing habit execution, right?\\n\\nThe performance of things you already know\\n\\nhow to do and a reduction in the neural circuits,\\n\\nor I should say a reduction in the number of synapses\\n\\nof the contacts within the neural circuits\\n\\nthat are controlling behavior.\\n\\nSo this again is a not often discussed aspect\\n\\nof alcohol intake.\\n\\nFortunately, it is reversible.\\n\\nSo in animals or humans that undertake a period\\n\\nof abstinence of anywhere from two to six months,\\n\\nthese neural circuits return to normal,\\n\\nexcept in cases where people have been chronically drinking\\n\\nlarge volumes of alcohol for many, many years.\\n\\nAnd in those cases,\\n\\nwhile there is some recovery of brain circuitry\\n\\nafter people get sober, meaning completely sober,\\n\\nthey stop drinking entirely,\\n\\nthere is evidence of long lasting impact\\n\\nof heavy alcohol usage throughout the lifespan.\\n\\nBut of course, this doesn't mean that anyone\\n\\nthat's suffering from alcoholism or that used to\\n\\nshould not continue to focus on their health.\\n\\nYou absolutely should, all is not lost.\\n\\nBut for people that have been drinking for a lot of years,\\n\\nmaybe you went to college and you drank a lot in those years\\n\\nand your neural circuits change.\\n\\nIf there's a period in which you don't drink alcohol,\\n\\nagain, from two to six months and ideally longer,\\n\\nthose neural circuits can then be remodified\\n\\nback to their original state.\\n\\nSo let's consider some of the other neurochemical effects\\n\\nof alcohol in the brain and body.\\n\\nAnd again, for right now,\\n\\nwe're confining the conversation to people that are drinking\\n\\non average one or two drinks per night.\\n\\nNow, some people might think that two drinks per night\\n\\nis a lot, and a lot of that will depend on body weight.\\n\\nSo for instance, people who weigh 110 pounds,\\n\\nfor them to ingest two alcoholic drinks\\n\\nis going to be substantially different\\n\\nin terms of the biochemical effects\\n\\nthan somebody who weighs 220 pounds.\\n\\nOf course, tolerance will also factor into this.\\n\\nGenetic background will also factor into this.\\n\\nAnd indeed, whether or not people have eaten\\n\\nwill factor into this.\\n\\nSo there are a lot of factors, and we'll talk about that.\\n\\nFor the time being, if you're curious about how food impacts\\n\\nthe effects of alcohol and your feelings of being drunk,\\n\\nyou may have heard, for instance,\\n\\nthat if somebody's inebriated and they want to sober up,\\n\\nthey should eat something.\\n\\nTurns out that does not work.\\n\\nHere's how it does work, however.\\n\\nIf you eat something prior to drinking alcohol\\n\\nor while ingesting alcohol,\\n\\nit will slow the absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream.\\n\\nIn other words, you won't feel as drunk as fast.\\n\\nFor many of you, this probably comes as no surprise.\\n\\nIn particular, if that meal includes carbohydrates,\\n\\nfats, and proteins, okay?\\n\\nThe inclusion of all three major macronutrients\\n\\nseems to slow the absorption of alcohol\\n\\ninto the bloodstream far more than having any one of those\\n\\nor two of those macronutrients present.\\n\\nNow, if you are already inebriated\\n\\nor you've had a glass of wine or a beer\\n\\nand you eat something,\\n\\nchances are that alcohol has already made it\\n\\ninto your bloodstream\\n\\nbecause it moves into the bloodstream so quickly.\\n\\nAgain, it's fat-soluble and water-soluble.\\n\\nSo within minutes, if you have an empty stomach,\\n\\nwithin five to 10 minutes,\\n\\nthat alcohol is going to be within your bloodstream\\n\\nand distributed throughout your body,\\n\\nmaybe even faster depending on the type of alcohol\\n\\nand your metabolism.\\n\\nBut if you're already drunk and you eat something,\\n\\nit's not going to sober you up more quickly,\\n\\nbut it certainly will blunt the effects\\n\\nof any additional alcohol that you might consume.\\n\\nAnd if you're somebody who is concerned\\n\\nabout getting too drunk too quick,\\n\\neven from a small amount of alcohol,\\n\\nhaving some food in your gut can certainly be beneficial.\\n\\nNow, that's food and alcohol and the absorption of alcohol,\\n\\nbut let's go back to talking about the biochemical\\n\\nand neurochemical effects of alcohol in the brain.\\n\\nWe talked about top-down inhibition\\n\\nand we talked about habitual\\n\\nand impulsive behavior circuitry.\\n\\nThere are also dramatic changes\\n\\nin the activity of neurons that control the release\\n\\nof so-called serotonin.\\n\\nSerotonin is a neuromodulator.\\n\\nIt changes the activity of neural circuits\\n\\nand many neural circuits,\\n\\nin particular those involved in mood\\n\\nand feelings of wellbeing.\\n\\nRecently, there's been a lot of interest in serotonin\\n\\nbecause of a study that was released\\n\\nthat showed pretty conclusively\\n\\nthat serotonin levels can't really explain depression\\n\\nand depression-like symptoms.\\n\\nI want to make it very clear\\n\\nthat although that study did show that serotonin levels\\n\\nare not necessarily associated with depression,\\n\\nthe study was interpreted by many to mean\\n\\nthat SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,\\n\\nwhich have the net effect of increasing serotonin.\\n\\nThese are things like Prozac, et cetera,\\n\\nthat those drugs are somehow not helpful\\n\\nbecause they increase serotonin\\n\\nand serotonin isn't involved in depression.\\n\\nThat logic doesn't really hold together\\n\\nso I'm going to use this as an opportunity\\n\\nto just clarify what really occurred there\\n\\nand then we'll talk about how serotonin relates\\n\\nto alcohol consumption in things\\n\\nlike feeling good and in depression.\\n\\nThe key thing is this,\\n\\nSSRIs can help alleviate depression.\\n\\nThat's right, SSRIs can help alleviate depression.\\n\\nThey are often not always associated with side effects,\\n\\ndosage is very important, et cetera,\\n\\nbut they probably support relief from depression\\n\\nby changing neural circuits,\\n\\nnot necessarily by increasing serotonin itself.\\n\\nThat is, increasing serotonin with these drugs\\n\\nlikely change the neural circuits involved in mood,\\n\\nallowing people to feel better\\n\\nthrough so-called neuroplasticity,\\n\\nwhich is the brain's ability to change itself\\n\\nin response to experience.\\n\\nSo there's a bit of confusion\\n\\nand again, I'm using this episode on alcohol\\n\\nto highlight some of the confusion\\n\\nbecause I think it's timely\\n\\nbecause the study just came out\\n\\nand there's a lot of chatter about this out there\\n\\nthat when people are depressed,\\n\\nit's not necessarily because serotonin levels are low.\\n\\nHowever, if serotonin levels are increased\\n\\nwith things like Prozac, Zoloft and other SSRIs,\\n\\noftentimes there is, yes, a relief from depression,\\n\\nbut that's probably not\\n\\nbecause of restoring serotonin levels per se,\\n\\nit's probably because serotonin facilitates\\n\\nthe changes in neural circuits that need to occur\\n\\nin order for people to feel elevated mood, okay?\\n\\nSo again, that's a bit of a tangent and a side,\\n\\nbut I do think it's a vital one for people to know about.\\n\\nAgain, if you're thinking about taking SSRIs,\\n\\nyou're currently taking them and you've heard this news,\\n\\ndefinitely talk to your doctor.\\n\\nAgain, there is great utility for some of these SSRIs\\n\\nand also in conditions like OCD,\\n\\nthey've been shown to be very beneficial.\\n\\nSo we really don't want to throw SSRIs out\\n\\nas a potentially valuable treatment.\\n\\nGetting back to the effects of alcohol on serotonin,\\n\\nit's very clear beyond any doubt\\n\\nthat many of the circuits in the brain\\n\\nthat are involved in mood and feelings of wellbeing\\n\\nand also sort of self-image in how we see ourselves\\n\\nemploy the neuromodulator serotonin and alcohol\\n\\nwhen we ingest it and it's converted into acetylalbohyd,\\n\\nit goes and that acetylalbohyd acts as a toxin\\n\\nat the very synapses,\\n\\nthe connections between the serotonergic neurons\\n\\nand lots of other neurons.\\n\\nIn other words, when we ingest alcohol,\\n\\nthe toxic effects of alcohol disrupt those mood circuitries\\n\\nat first making them hyperactive.\\n\\nThat's right, making them hyperactive.\\n\\nThis is why people become really talkative.\\n\\nPeople start to feel really good after a few sips of alcohol,\\n\\nat least most people do.\\n\\nAnd then as they ingest more alcohol\\n\\nor as that alcohol wears off,\\n\\nserotonin levels and the activity of those circuits\\n\\nreally starts to drop.\\n\\nAnd that's why people feel less good.\\n\\nAnd typically what they do, they go and get another drink\\n\\nand they attempt to kind of restore that feeling\\n\\nof wellbeing and mood.\\n\\nNow, typically what happens is that as people ingest\\n\\nthe third and fourth, maybe even the fifth drink,\\n\\nthere's an absolute zero chance of them recovering\\n\\nthat energized mood, right?\\n\\nMost people as they drink more and more\\n\\nwill now start to feel more and more suppressed.\\n\\nThe forebrain is now shutting down quite a lot.\\n\\nA lot of the motor cortical areas\\n\\nthat control coordinated movement\\n\\nand deliberate movement start to shut down.\\n\\nSo people start to slur their speech.\\n\\nPeople start to shuffle their feet.\\n\\nPeople forget their posture.\\n\\nPeople start to lean on things.\\n\\nPeople start passing out on couches.\\n\\nThere's a great depression,\\n\\nnot depression of the psychiatric depression sort,\\n\\nbut a depression of alertness and arousal.\\n\\nAnd eventually people will pass out.\\n\\nNow, I said most people because there's a subset of people\\n\\nthat have gene variants or who are chronic drinkers\\n\\nor who are chronic drinkers and have gene variants\\n\\nthat as they ingest the third and fourth and fifth drink,\\n\\nwhat happens?\\n\\nThey become more alert.\\n\\nThey start talking more.\\n\\nThey feel great.\\n\\nThey have all sorts of ideas\\n\\nabout the fun they could have that night.\\n\\nAnd they're the ones that if you've ever fallen asleep\\n\\nat a party for whatever reason,\\n\\nor you're getting tired and you're yawning\\n\\nand you're looking around the room\\n\\nand like these people are still drinking and partying\\n\\nand they're having what seems to be this amazing time,\\n\\noften not always,\\n\\nthose are the future alcoholics in the room,\\n\\nor those are the people\\n\\nthat have a genetic predisposition for alcoholism,\\n\\nor those are the chronic drinkers,\\n\\nthe people who have built up enough of a tolerance\\n\\nor who have the chemical genetic makeup\\n\\nsuch that increasing amounts of alcohol\\n\\nmake them feel better and better and better.\\n\\nAnd of course, they too have a threshold\\n\\nbeyond which their nervous system will start to get diminished\\n\\nand they'll pass out and fall over, et cetera.\\n\\nBut that threshold is way, way higher\\n\\nthan it is for most people.\\n\\nNow, this is important to understand.\\n\\nAnd it's important to understand\\n\\nbecause I think everyone should know\\n\\nand recognize their own predisposition\\n\\nand kind of risk in terms of developing alcoholism.\\n\\nIt's also important to understand\\n\\nbecause it relates to the phenomenon of blackout.\\n\\nMany people think that blacking out is passing out,\\n\\nbut blackout drunk is when people drink\\n\\nand they're talking and doing things.\\n\\nSometimes sadly, or tragically,\\n\\nthey'll often drive home or walk home\\n\\nor they'll hop on a bicycle and ride home\\n\\nor they'll go swimming in the ocean,\\n\\nall of course, very dangerous activities\\n\\nto do when people are really drunk\\n\\nor even a little bit drunk in some cases.\\n\\nSo these people will do these sorts of things\\n\\nand they do them because they have the energy to do them\\n\\nand they feel good while doing them,\\n\\nbut they are doing them while the activity of neurons\\n\\nin the hippocampus, which is involved in memory formation,\\n\\nare completely shut off.\\n\\nAnd this is why the next day you tell them,\\n\\nhey, maybe we should talk about what happened last night.\\n\\nLike, what happened last night?\\n\\nYou said, well, do you remember going to the party?\\n\\nYeah, no, it was great.\\n\\nWe did this, we did this, and then what?\\n\\nAnd it's very clear all of a sudden\\n\\nthat they have no recollection\\n\\nof all the things they were doing despite being awake.\\n\\nNow, I wish I could tell you\\n\\nthat there's some sort of blood test or other biomarker,\\n\\neven a fingerprint test that would allow you\\n\\nto determine whether or not you have a propensity\\n\\nto be one of these drinkers\\n\\nthat has a predisposition for alcoholism.\\n\\nAnd if you've ever been blackout drunk,\\n\\nand certainly if you've been blackout drunk\\n\\nmore than a few times, you should be quite concerned.\\n\\nAnd as we talk more about the more chronic effects\\n\\nand long-lasting effects of alcohol consumption\\n\\na little bit later in the episode,\\n\\nI think it will become clear\\n\\nas to why you should be concerned.\\n\\nBut in any case, there is something that can tell you\\n\\nwhether or not you might be in that category\\n\\nversus likely not in that category.\\n\\nAnd I alluded to this a couple of times already,\\n\\nbut I want to be really clear that when people drink,\\n\\nno matter who you are,\\n\\ninitially there's that shutting down\\n\\nof those prefrontal cortical circuits.\\n\\nThere's a gradual shutting down of the circuits\\n\\nthat control memory,\\n\\nbut then people divide into these two bins.\\n\\nAnd these two bins are the people\\n\\nwho after more than a couple of drinks\\n\\nstart to feel sedated,\\n\\nand the people who after more than a few drinks\\n\\ndo not start to feel sedated.\\n\\nNow, of course, there's going to be differences\\n\\ncreated by how quickly people are drinking,\\n\\nwhether or not they're combining different types of alcohol,\\n\\nthe types of alcohol, et cetera.\\n\\nBut in general, that can predict whether or not\\n\\nyou're somebody who has a predisposition\\n\\nfor alcoholism or not.\\n\\nOne also very interesting finding\\n\\nis that alcohol changes the relationship\\n\\nbetween what's called the hypothalamus\\n\\nand the pituitary gland and the adrenals.\\n\\nNow, the hypothalamus is a small collection of neurons\\n\\nabout the size of a large gumball\\n\\nsits above the roof of your mouth,\\n\\nand it houses neurons that are responsible\\n\\nfor some incredible aspects of our behavior and our mindset.\\n\\nThings like rage, things like sex drive,\\n\\nthings like temperature regulation,\\n\\nvery primitive functions,\\n\\nincluding appetite, thirst, et cetera.\\n\\nAlcohol, because it can go anywhere in the brain,\\n\\nremember it's water and fat-soluble,\\n\\nhas effects on the hypothalamus.\\n\\nThe hypothalamus normally provides very specific signals\\n\\nto what's called the pituitary gland.\\n\\nThis is a little gland\\n\\nthat actually sticks out of the brain,\\n\\nbut it receives instructions from the hypothalamus.\\n\\nAnd then the pituitary releases hormones\\n\\ninto the bloodstream that go and talk to your adrenals.\\n\\nYour adrenal glands sit right above your kidneys\\n\\nin your lower back.\\n\\nAnd the adrenals release, as the name suggests,\\n\\nadrenaline, also called epinephrine,\\n\\nand also a molecule called cortisol,\\n\\nwhich is involved in the kind of longer-term stress response\\n\\nand has some healthy effects too on the immune system.\\n\\nOkay, so the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis,\\n\\nI know that's a mouthful,\\n\\nyou don't need to remember the names,\\n\\nbut the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis\\n\\nmaintains your physiological balance\\n\\nof what you perceive as stressful\\n\\nand what you don't perceive as stressful.\\n\\nPeople who drink regularly,\\n\\nso this again could be just one or two drinks per night,\\n\\nor it could be somebody that drinks just on Fridays\\n\\nor just on Saturdays or maybe just on the weekend,\\n\\ntwo to four drinks.\\n\\nWell, those people experience changes\\n\\nin their hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis\\n\\nthat result in more cortisol,\\n\\nmore of this so-called stress hormone\\n\\nbeing released at baseline when they are not drinking.\\n\\nThis is really important.\\n\\nPeople who drink a bit, and when I say a bit,\\n\\nI don't mean one or two sips\\n\\nor even a glass of wine every once in a while.\\n\\nI mean, again, people that are maybe having\\n\\none drink a night with dinner\\n\\nand maybe on the weekend a few more.\\n\\nAgain, I offer a bunch of different patterns\\n\\nto explain how it could also be two or three drinks\\n\\non Friday or six drinks only on Saturday.\\n\\nWell, all of those groups experience increases\\n\\nin cortisol release from their adrenal glands\\n\\nwhen they are not drinking.\\n\\nAnd as a consequence, they feel more stressed\\n\\nand more anxiety when they aren't drinking.\\n\\nThis is a seldom talked about effect of alcohol\\n\\nbecause so often we hear about\\n\\nthe immediate effects of alcohol, right?\\n\\nAnd we've been talking about some of those effects.\\n\\nEffects like reducing the amount of stress.\\n\\nI mean, how many times have we heard somebody say,\\n\\noh, I need a drink.\\n\\nAnd then they have a drink and they're like, calm down.\\n\\nNow they can shake off the thoughts about the day's work.\\n\\nThey can start to think about things\\n\\nin a maybe more grounded or rational way,\\n\\nor at least they believe that,\\n\\nor they can somehow just relax themselves.\\n\\nWell, while that very well may be true\\n\\nthat it can relax them when they are not drinking,\\n\\nthat level of cortisol that's released at baseline\\n\\nhas increased substantially.\\n\\nAgain, this relates to a defined neural circuit\\n\\nbetween brain and body.\\n\\nAnd it has to do with the ratio of cortisol\\n\\nto some of the other hormones\\n\\ninvolved in the stress response.\\n\\nWe'll provide a reference to the study\\n\\nthat describes how all of this works\\n\\nfor those of you that really want to delve into it.\\n\\nBut let's go back to this issue\\n\\nof those who are prone to alcoholism\\n\\nversus those who are not.\\n\\nRemember, there are people who have genetic variants\\n\\nthat meaning genes that they inherited from their parents\\n\\nthat make it more likely that they will become alcoholics.\\n\\nBut there are also people who drink often\\n\\nwho start to experience this increase in alertness\\n\\nthe longer they drink across the night.\\n\\nPart of that effect we think is because of changes\\n\\nin this hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.\\n\\nSo alcohol is kind of a double hit in this sense.\\n\\nIt's causing changes in our brain circuitry\\n\\nand neurochemistry that at the time\\n\\nin which we're inebriated are detrimental.\\n\\nAnd it's causing changes in neural circuitry\\n\\nthat persist long past the time\\n\\nin which we're experiencing the feeling\\n\\nof being tipsy or drunk.\\n\\nNow, again, I don't want to demonize alcohol.\\n\\nI'm not saying, oh, you know,\\n\\nif you have a glass of wine now and again,\\n\\nor you drink a beer now and again,\\n\\nor even have, you know, a mixed drink now and again,\\n\\nor a shot, that that's necessarily terrible for you.\\n\\nI certainly do not want that to be the message.\\n\\nWhat I'm saying is that\\n\\nif people are ingesting alcohol chronically,\\n\\neven if it's not every night,\\n\\nthere are well-recognized changes in neural circuits,\\n\\nthere are well-recognized changes\\n\\nin neurochemistry within the brain,\\n\\nand there are well-recognized changes\\n\\nin the brain-to-body stress system\\n\\nthat generally point in three directions,\\n\\nincreased stress when people are not drinking,\\n\\ndiminished mood and feelings of wellbeing\\n\\nwhen people are not drinking,\\n\\nand as you'll soon learn,\\n\\nchanges in the neural circuitry\\n\\nthat cause people to want to drink even more\\n\\nin order to get just back to baseline\\n\\nwhere the place that they were\\n\\nin terms of their stress modulation\\n\\nand in terms of their feelings of mood\\n\\nbefore they ever started drinking in the first place.\\n\\nSo again, I don't want to demonize alcohol,\\n\\nbut I do want to emphasize\\n\\nthat there are long-term plastic changes,\\n\\nmeaning changes in neural circuitry and hormone circuitry\\n\\nthat across a period of several months\\n\\nand certainly across a period of years\\n\\nof the sorts of drinking patterns I described,\\n\\nwhich I think for most people\\n\\nare going to sound like pretty typical, right?\\n\\nI mean, nothing that I described so far\\n\\nwas about drinking a case a night\\n\\nor about binging on alcohol\\n\\nin the way that we often hear about it in the news.\\n\\nThese are pretty common patterns of alcohol consumption.\\n\\nI mean, all you have to do is board a transatlantic flight\\n\\nor actually go to an airport on a Sunday afternoon\\n\\nin a sunny area of the US,\\n\\nand people are having three, four, five, six beers, et cetera.\\n\\nAgain, personal choice is personal choice.\\n\\nI'm not telling you what to do,\\n\\nbut it's very clear that those sorts of drinking patterns\\n\\nare changing neural circuitry\\n\\nand they're changing hormone circuitry.\\n\\nAnd I'd love to be able to tell you\\n\\nthat they're changing them for the better,\\n\\nbut they simply are not.\\n\\nThey're actually changing them for the worse.\\n\\nAnd worse is defined as making people\\n\\nless resilient to stress,\\n\\nhigher levels of baseline stress, and lower mood overall.\\n\\nBefore we continue with today's discussion,\\n\\nI'd like to just briefly acknowledge our sponsor,\\n\\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1.\\n\\nAthletic Greens, AKA AG1,\\n\\nis an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink\\n\\nthat also has adaptogens and digestive enzymes.\\n\\nI've been taking Athletic Greens since way back in 2012,\\n\\nso I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.\\n\\nThe reason I started taking Athletic Greens\\n\\nand the reason I still drink Athletic Greens twice a day\\n\\nis that it supplies total foundational coverage\\n\\nof my vitamin mineral needs,\\n\\nand it supplies important nutrients that I need\\n\\nto support my gut microbiome.\\n\\nThe gut microbiome, as many of you know,\\n\\nsupports the immune system.\\n\\nIt also supports the so-called gut brain axis,\\n\\nwhich is vital for mood, for energy levels,\\n\\nfor regulating focus, and many other features\\n\\nof our mental health and physical health\\n\\nthat impact our daily performance and high performance\\n\\nin any endeavors we might be involved in.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\\n\\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman\\n\\nand claim a special offer.\\n\\nThey're giving away five free travel packs\\n\\nplus a year supply of vitamin D3K2 with every order.\\n\\nAnd of course, vitamin D3K2 are vital\\n\\nfor all sorts of things like hormone health\\n\\nand metabolic health,\\n\\nand K2 for cardiovascular health and calcium regulation.\\n\\nAgain, you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman\\n\\nto claim that special offer.\\n\\nNow, I've been talking a little bit\\n\\nabout genetic predisposition,\\n\\nbut there are a couple of important points\\n\\nI'd like to make about that.\\n\\nFirst of all, what sorts of genes are involved\\n\\nin setting someone down the path of alcoholism or not?\\n\\nWell, it should come as no surprise\\n\\nthat the genes that chronic alcohol usage modifies,\\n\\nthey tend to fall primarily in the pathways\\n\\nrelated to genetic control over serotonin receptors,\\n\\nGABA receptors, remember that top-down inhibition\\n\\nand the involvement of GABA, and no surprise,\\n\\nthe HPA, the hypothalamic pituitary axis.\\n\\nAll of those, of course, combine with environment,\\n\\nthey combine with patterns of abuse, right?\\n\\nWe know that if you're in a social setting\\n\\nwhere a lot of people are drinking,\\n\\nthe likelihood that you're going to drink is much higher,\\n\\nsocial pressures, trauma, right?\\n\\nSome people will use alcohol to self-medicate\\n\\nto try and turn off their thinking\\n\\nor to deal with trauma, et cetera.\\n\\nSo they combine with the environment,\\n\\nbut the genes that are in the serotonin synthesis\\n\\nand receptor synthesis pathway, GABA and HPA axis,\\n\\ncombine with environmental pressures\\n\\nto give rise to alcohol use disorders.\\n\\nSo there's a fairly coherent picture\\n\\nthat we have here, right?\\n\\nThis is not a case where, for instance,\\n\\npeople that have a lot of the enzyme\\n\\nfor metabolizing alcohol,\\n\\nwhich we'll talk about in a minute, alcohol dehydrogenase,\\n\\nit's not like they are necessarily the people\\n\\nthat become alcoholics,\\n\\nwhereas certainly in certain cultures,\\n\\ncertain Asian cultures in particular,\\n\\nthere are gene differences that lead them\\n\\nto have low levels of alcohol dehydrogenase.\\n\\nThere are actually people who have so little alcohol\\n\\ndehydrogenase that when they ingest alcohol,\\n\\nthey get very red and they just feel sick.\\n\\nSo if you're somebody that has a sip of alcohol\\n\\nand you just feel horrible, it makes you feel nauseous.\\n\\nChances are you have gene variants\\n\\nthat create a situation where you're not making\\n\\nvery much alcohol dehydrogenase.\\n\\nYou just simply can't metabolize alcohol.\\n\\nSo you just get a rapid buildup\\n\\nof the toxic effects of alcohol, the acetyl aldehyde.\\n\\nYou're not converting it into those empty calories.\\n\\nBut in cultures where you have a lot of genetic variants\\n\\nand genes expressed in people\\n\\nwhere they have a lot of alcohol dehydrogenase,\\n\\nsure, they can drink more\\n\\nand they're converting more of that alcohol\\n\\nfrom its toxic form to a non-toxic form.\\n\\nAnd yes, of course, you will observe more alcoholism\\n\\nin those communities because they're drinking more.\\n\\nBut I do want to emphasize that the environmental factors\\n\\nare playing a strong role there too,\\n\\nbecause if you can drink more, you're likely to drink more.\\n\\nIf you're somebody that feels sick immediately\\n\\nfrom drinking, it's likely that you're not going to engage\\n\\nin alcohol consumption,\\n\\nespecially if these things are genetically related.\\n\\nAnd of course, genes and culture and location\\n\\nin the world tend to run together.\\n\\nSo do you have the gene for alcoholism?\\n\\nWell, there isn't one single gene.\\n\\nChances are if you have an immediate relative\\n\\nwho's a chronic abuser of alcohol\\n\\nor several relatives who are chronic abusers of alcohol,\\n\\nwell, that's going to predispose you to be an alcoholic.\\n\\nBut since you don't know which genes you express,\\n\\nunless you do genetic testing and those things are available,\\n\\nbut most people aren't doing that,\\n\\nthis assay, if you will,\\n\\nit's not an assay, as we say,\\n\\nan assay is a test that you run in the lab\\n\\nto determine something.\\n\\nAnd it's not one that I recommend\\n\\nthat you go drink in order to do.\\n\\nBut if you've noticed that you or somebody else\\n\\nis somebody who can drink a lot throughout the night\\n\\nand have increased energy,\\n\\nyou can just drink and drink and drink.\\n\\nAnd especially if there's blackout episodes,\\n\\nnot remembering things the next day,\\n\\ndespite being alert throughout the entire night and so on,\\n\\nwell, then I would be very concerned\\n\\nthat you might actually have a genetic variant\\n\\npredisposing you to alcoholism.\\n\\nThe other thing that predisposes people\\n\\nto abuse of alcohol is age.\\n\\nPeople who start drinking at younger ages\\n\\nare greatly predisposed to developing alcohol dependence,\\n\\nregardless of your family history of alcoholism.\\n\\nOkay, so I'm going to repeat that.\\n\\nPeople who start drinking younger\\n\\nare at great risk for developing alcoholism,\\n\\neven if they don't have alcoholism in their family.\\n\\nNow, of course, you don't have to be an epidemiologist\\n\\nto understand that if you grow up in a family of drinkers\\n\\nand alcohol is everywhere,\\n\\nand especially if there's peer pressure or lack of oversight,\\n\\nthen there's going to be a higher tendency\\n\\nor a higher probability, I should say,\\n\\nthat you will start drinking at a younger age.\\n\\nHowever, even people that grow up\\n\\nnowhere near their relatives,\\n\\nif they start drinking at a young age,\\n\\nso for instance, at 13 or younger or 14 or 15,\\n\\nthere's a much higher probability\\n\\nthat they're going to develop\\n\\na long-lasting dependence on alcohol.\\n\\nPeople who take their first sip of alcohol later,\\n\\n15, 16, or one would hope even later,\\n\\nI can say one would hope,\\n\\nbecause I'm now of that age and generation\\n\\nwhere you think about all the things that young people do\\n\\nand you go, oh gosh, if they only would wait,\\n\\nor if they only would abstain, you know,\\n\\nso it's what happens.\\n\\nI don't know, there's some neural circuit for that\\n\\nthat I can't explain yet.\\n\\nBut people who, for instance,\\n\\ndrink only once they reach legal age of drinking,\\n\\nwhich in the US, I believe in every state is 21 years old,\\n\\nif they take their first drink at 21,\\n\\nthe probability that they'll go on\\n\\nto develop full-blown alcohol dependence\\n\\nor alcohol use disorder, as it's called, AUD, is very low.\\n\\nNow, a subset of them will\\n\\nbecause they have such a strong genetic predisposition\\n\\nwhere maybe life circumstances create a pattern\\n\\nin which they become a chronic drinker.\\n\\nBut I found this very interesting.\\n\\nGenes matter, but also the age\\n\\nin which somebody starts drinking really matters.\\n\\nNow, whether or not that's because there are changes\\n\\nin neural circuitry as a consequence of that drinking,\\n\\nthat make people want to seek out more and more alcohol,\\n\\nor whether or not there's some other effect,\\n\\nmaybe it's a change in hormones, et cetera,\\n\\nthat predisposes those young drinkers\\n\\nto become chronic drinkers or even full-blown alcoholics,\\n\\ncertainly developing alcohol use disorder.\\n\\nThere's definition for that.\\n\\nWe can talk about it.\\n\\nIt involves the amount of drinking\\n\\nover a certain period of time, et cetera.\\n\\nSo it's very clear that drinking early in life\\n\\ncreates a propensity for the development\\n\\nof alcohol use disorder later in life.\\n\\nAnd while there is a genetic component\\n\\nto developing alcohol use disorder,\\n\\nI find it very interesting that if people\\n\\nwho have those gene variants delay their onset of drinking,\\n\\nwell, then the probability that they'll develop\\n\\nfull-blown alcohol use disorder drops as well.\\n\\nSo again, it's genes and environments,\\n\\nnot an either or, and there's no single gene for alcoholism.\\n\\nWell, I promise you I will also talk about\\n\\nsome of the documented positive effects of alcohol,\\n\\nalthough they are very few and far between.\\n\\nThey do exist.\\n\\nBut before I do that, I would be remiss\\n\\nif I didn't emphasize some more of the terrible things\\n\\nthat alcohol does and the way that it does it.\\n\\nAnd for those of you that enjoy alcohol,\\n\\nagain, I really like to say I feel guilty\\n\\nabout telling you this because I know how much\\n\\nsome people enjoy a good drink every once in a while.\\n\\nAnd I say a good drink because some people\\n\\ndo like the taste of alcohol.\\n\\nI suppose I lucked out in that I don't really like\\n\\nthe taste of alcohol and that just puts me to sleep,\\n\\nbut I know that people do enjoy it.\\n\\nAnd I do want to point out that there is zero evidence\\n\\nthat provided somebody is of drinking age\\n\\nor certainly not in the stage of brain development\\n\\nthat having one drink or two drinks every now and again,\\n\\nmeaning every three or four weeks or once a month,\\n\\nthat is not going to cause major health concerns\\n\\nor major health issues for most people.\\n\\nI suppose if you have zero or very little alcohol\\n\\ndehydrogenates, it might make you feel sick,\\n\\nbut then you're probably not the kind of person\\n\\nthat's going to be drinking at all.\\n\\nSo again, if you enjoy alcoholic drinks,\\n\\nI'm not trying to take them away from you by any means,\\n\\nbut you should know what drinking does\\n\\nif you're consuming it in this kind of typical\\n\\nchronic pattern as we can now refer to it,\\n\\nwhich is that one or two a night or a few stacked up\\n\\non Friday and maybe three or four on Saturday,\\n\\nthis kind of pattern of drinking, which is quite common.\\n\\nAnd one of the more serious effects\\n\\nthat we should think about is the impact\\n\\non the so-called gut-brain axis,\\n\\nor for sake of today's discussion,\\n\\nthe gut-liver-brain axis.\\n\\nI don't think the gut-liver-brain axis\\n\\nhas ever been discussed on this podcast,\\n\\nmaybe any podcast, although at the moment I say that,\\n\\nI'm going to, you know, the gut-liver-brain axis,\\n\\npeople are going to come after me with,\\n\\nI suppose, gut-liver-brain and brains.\\n\\nIn any event, you have a brain, you have a gut,\\n\\nthat gut runs from your throat\\n\\ndown to the end of your intestine.\\n\\nYour gut and your brain communicate by way of nerve cells,\\n\\nneurons and nerve connections,\\n\\nthe vagus nerve in particular,\\n\\nand by way of chemical signaling.\\n\\nYour gut also communicates by way of chemical signaling,\\n\\nand believe it or not,\\n\\nby way of neural signaling to your liver.\\n\\nAnd as we talked about earlier,\\n\\nthe liver is the first site in which alcohol\\n\\nis broken down and metabolized into its component parts.\\n\\nThe liver is also communicating with the brain\\n\\nthrough chemical signaling and neural signaling.\\n\\nSo we have the gut-liver-brain axis.\\n\\nAnd what you find is that people who ingest alcohol\\n\\nat any amount are inducing a disruption\\n\\nin the so-called gut microbiome,\\n\\nthe trillions of little micro bacteria\\n\\nthat take resident in your gut\\n\\nand that live inside you all the time\\n\\nand that helps support your immune system\\n\\nand that literally signal by way of electrical signals\\n\\nand chemical signals to your brain\\n\\nto increase the release of things like serotonin\\n\\nand dopamine and regulate your mood,\\n\\ngenerally in positive ways.\\n\\nWell, alcohol really disrupts those bacteria.\\n\\nAnd this should come as no surprise.\\n\\nI mean, earlier we talked about this and it's well known.\\n\\nIf you want to sterilize something,\\n\\nyou want to kill the bacteria, you pour alcohol on it.\\n\\nAnd I can remember scraping myself or cutting myself.\\n\\nI was always injuring myself when I was a kid.\\n\\nAnd the moment they take out the peroxide,\\n\\nyou're like, oh boy, here it comes.\\n\\nBut if there's no peroxide around\\n\\nand you've got a wound there and you need to clean it out,\\n\\nyeah, they'll use alcohol,\\n\\nwhich I do not recommend by the way.\\n\\nAnd that's one of the harshest ways to clean a wound.\\n\\nBut for centuries, thousands of years really,\\n\\nalcohol has been used in order to clean things\\n\\nand kill bacteria.\\n\\nSo alcohol kills bacteria and it is indiscriminate\\n\\nwith respect to which bacteria it kills.\\n\\nSo when we ingest alcohol and it goes into our gut,\\n\\nit kills a lot of the healthy gut microbiota.\\n\\nAt the same time, the metabolism of alcohol in the liver,\\n\\nwhich you now understand that pathway involving NAD,\\n\\nacetylaldehyde and acetate,\\n\\nthat pathway is pro-inflammatory.\\n\\nSo it's increasing the release of inflammatory cytokines,\\n\\nthings like IL-6, et cetera, tumor necrosis factor alpha.\\n\\nIf you'd like to learn more about the immune system,\\n\\nwe did an episode all about the immune system.\\n\\nYou can find it at hubermanlab.com.\\n\\nI'll teach you all the basics of what are cytokines,\\n\\nwhat are mast cells, et cetera.\\n\\nIn any event, all these pro-inflammatory molecules,\\n\\nthose are being released.\\n\\nYou've now got disruption of the gut microbiota.\\n\\nAs a consequence, the lining of the gut is disrupted\\n\\nand you develop at least transiently leaky gut.\\n\\nThat is bacteria that exists in the gut,\\n\\nwhich are bad bacteria,\\n\\ncan now pass out of the gut into the bloodstream.\\n\\nSo you've got a two hit kind of model here.\\n\\nIn biology, we talk about two hit models\\n\\nthat is kind of a one plus one equals four.\\n\\nAnd it's generally when you hear two hit,\\n\\nit's not a good thing.\\n\\nSo you've got bad bacteria\\n\\nfrom partially broken down food moving out of the gut.\\n\\nThe good bacteria in the gut have been killed.\\n\\nYou might say, why doesn't the alcohol kill\\n\\nthe bad bacteria in the gut?\\n\\nWell, the bad bacteria\\n\\nthat are from partially digested food\\n\\noftentimes escape the gut\\n\\nbefore the alcohol can disrupt them.\\n\\nAnd so now you've got leaks in the gut wall.\\n\\nYou've got the release of this bad bacteria.\\n\\nYou've got inflammatory cytokines\\n\\nand other things being released from the liver.\\n\\nAnd they are able to get into the brain\\n\\nthrough what's called a neuroimmune signaling.\\n\\nAnd what's really bizarre in terms of the way\\n\\nthat this manifests in the brain.\\n\\nI mean, it's not the way I would have done it,\\n\\nbut then again, as I always say,\\n\\nI wasn't consulted at the design phase\\n\\nand anyone who says they did,\\n\\nyou should be very skeptical of them.\\n\\nThe net effect of this is actually to disrupt\\n\\nthe neural circuits that control regulation\\n\\nof alcohol intake.\\n\\nAnd the net effect of that is increased alcohol consumption.\\n\\nSo this is just terrible, right?\\n\\nI mean, you take in something that disrupts two systems,\\n\\nthe gut microbiota, and it disrupts in two ways.\\n\\nIt's killing the good gut microbiota\\n\\nand it's allowing the bad bacteria\\n\\nto move from the gut into the bloodstream.\\n\\nYou've also got pro-inflammatory cytokines\\n\\ncoming from the liver and those converge\\n\\nor arrive in the brain and create a system\\n\\nin which the neural circuits cause more drinking.\\n\\nThat's a bad situation.\\n\\nAnd this is why people who drink regularly,\\n\\neven if it's not a ton of alcohol,\\n\\nagain, of the sorts of patterns of drinking\\n\\nI talked about before,\\n\\nand certainly for those that are chronic heavy drinkers,\\n\\nwhat you end up with is a situation\\n\\nin which you have inflammation\\n\\nin multiple places in the brain and body\\n\\nand the desire to drink even more\\n\\nand to further exacerbate that inflammation\\n\\nand the gut leakiness.\\n\\nSo this is basically a terrible scenario\\n\\nfor the gut liver brain axis.\\n\\nAnd it's especially prevalent\\n\\nin so-called alcohol use disorder.\\n\\nAgain, people that are ingesting somewhere\\n\\nbetween 12 and 24 drinks per week.\\n\\nFor those of you that are interested\\n\\nin learning more about the gut liver brain axis\\n\\nand in particular alcohol use disorder,\\n\\nI'll provide a link in the show note captions.\\n\\nNow there's a wonderful review on this that details that.\\n\\nBut on the positive side,\\n\\nit points to the possibility that at least some,\\n\\nagain, at least some of the negative effects\\n\\nof alcohol consumption,\\n\\nwhether or not you're somebody\\n\\nwho's currently ingesting alcohol\\n\\nor who used to ingest alcohol\\n\\nand is trying to so-called repair these systems\\n\\nof the brain and body,\\n\\nwhether or not replenishing the gut microbiota\\n\\nis going to be beneficial.\\n\\nAnd we know that there are ways to do that.\\n\\nAnd we know that there's at least some promise\\n\\nfor the ability for the system to repair itself.\\n\\nHow does one do that?\\n\\nWell, I've talked before about this on the podcast,\\n\\nbut studies done by colleagues of mine at Stanford,\\n\\nJustin Sonnenberg, who's been on this podcast as a guest,\\n\\nan amazing episode all about the gut microbiome\\n\\nand his collaborator, Chris Garner,\\n\\nalso at Stanford School of Medicine,\\n\\nhave explored not alcoholism,\\n\\nbut what are ways to improve the gut microbiota\\n\\nin particular to reduce the production\\n\\nof inflammatory cytokines\\n\\nand to adjust what's called the inflammatory.\\n\\nYou've heard of the genome and the proteome, et cetera.\\n\\nWell, the inflammatory is the total array\\n\\nor at least the near total array of genes\\n\\nand proteins that control inflammation.\\n\\nHow can you reduce inflammation\\n\\nand make that inflammatory healthier?\\n\\nWell, they've shown that two to four servings\\n\\nof fermented foods per day.\\n\\nAnd here I'm not referring to fermented alcohol.\\n\\nI'm talking about low sugar fermented foods.\\n\\nSo things like kimchi, sauerkraut, natto,\\n\\nfor those of you that like Japanese food.\\n\\nThere are others, I know things like kefir,\\n\\nthings like yogurts that have a lot of active bacteria,\\n\\nagain, low sugar varieties of all these things.\\n\\nThose are terrific at reducing inflammatory markers\\n\\nand at improving the gut microbiome.\\n\\nOne could imagine that either inoculating oneself\\n\\nfrom some of the effects of alcohol,\\n\\nalthough I'd prefer that people just not drink alcohol\\n\\nchronically, frankly,\\n\\nor if somebody's trying to repair their gut microbiome\\n\\nbecause they ingested a lot of alcohol\\n\\nor because they had a lot of these inflammatory cytokines\\n\\nfor many years or even a short period of time,\\n\\nregular ingestion of two to four servings\\n\\nof these fermented foods can be quite beneficial.\\n\\nI want to make it clear that has not been examined\\n\\nspecifically in the context of alcohol use disorder,\\n\\nbut because a huge component of the negative effects\\n\\nof alcohol use disorder are based\\n\\nin this gut liver brain access and disruption\\n\\nof the gut microbiome and the inflammatory cytokines,\\n\\nit stands to reason that things that are well established\\n\\nto improve inflammation status,\\n\\nin other words, reduce inflammation,\\n\\nsuch as ingesting two to four servings\\n\\nof low sugar fermented foods per day,\\n\\nmakes sense in terms of trying to repair\\n\\nor replenish the system.\\n\\nOne could also imagine taking probiotics or prebiotics.\\n\\nCertainly that would work as well,\\n\\nalthough I've sort of favored the discussion\\n\\naround fermented foods and replenishment\\n\\nof the gut microbiome,\\n\\nmostly because there are more studies\\n\\nthat have examined that in humans\\n\\nand because of the direct relationship\\n\\nthat's been established between doing that\\n\\nand reducing negative markers within the inflammatory.\\n\\nAnd I should mention along the lines of repair and recovery,\\n\\nI put out a question on Twitter the other day.\\n\\nI said, what do you want to know about alcohol?\\n\\nI got more than a thousand questions.\\n\\nI'll take some more of those questions\\n\\na little later in the episode.\\n\\nBut one of the things I noticed is that\\n\\nmany of the questions, hundreds in fact,\\n\\nrelated to the question of,\\n\\nwell, if I drank a lot previously, am I doomed?\\n\\nCan I reverse the negative effects?\\n\\nOr I'm trying to drink less\\n\\nand I'm trying to improve my health as I do that.\\n\\nWhat should I do?\\n\\nWell, certainly focusing a bit on the gut microbiome\\n\\nought to be useful.\\n\\nThe other thing I should mention is\\n\\nas people wean themselves off alcohol,\\n\\neven if they're not full-blown alcoholics\\n\\nor have alcohol use disorder,\\n\\nthey should understand that increase in cortisol\\n\\nthat we talked about earlier,\\n\\nthat leads to lower stress threshold\\n\\nand greater feelings of anxiety and stress,\\n\\nthat's going to be present\\n\\nand it's going to take some time to dissipate.\\n\\nSo for some people, it might even just be helpful\\n\\nto realize that as you try and wean yourself off alcohol\\n\\nor maybe even go cold turkey,\\n\\nthat increased anxiety and feelings of stress\\n\\nshould be expected.\\n\\nAnd in that case, I would point you to an episode\\n\\nthat we did on master stress.\\n\\nYou can find that again at hubermanlab.com.\\n\\nIt's got a ton of behavioral, nutritional,\\n\\nsupplementation-based, exercise-based,\\n\\nI suppose exercise is behavioral,\\n\\nbut a lot of tools, you can navigate to those easily\\n\\nbecause we have timestamps,\\n\\nyou can go right to the topic of interest.\\n\\nThose tools are going to be very useful\\n\\nin trying to clamp or control your stress.\\n\\nAnd the point here is just that\\n\\nsome increase in stress should be expected\\n\\nand it should be expected\\n\\nbecause of that increase in cortisol\\n\\nthat occurs with even low-level consumption\\n\\nyet chronic alcohol consumption.\\n\\nNow I'd like to talk about a fairly common phenomenon,\\n\\nwhich is post-alcohol consumption malaise,\\n\\nalso referred to as hangover.\\n\\nHangover is a constellation of effects\\n\\nranging from headache to nausea\\n\\nto what's sometimes called anxiety,\\n\\nwhich is anxiety that follows a day of drinking.\\n\\nAnxiety, I think we can understand physiologically\\n\\nif we think about that process of alcohol intake\\n\\nincreasing the amount of cortisol\\n\\nand the ratio of cortisol to some other stress hormones.\\n\\nThat well explains why some people wake up the day after\\n\\nor even the day after a night drinking\\n\\nand feel anxious and not well and stressed\\n\\nfor reasons they don't understand.\\n\\nSo if you're somebody who experiences anxiety,\\n\\nthen again, I refer you to the master stress episode\\n\\nthat we put out some time ago\\n\\nand you can find that at hubermanlab.com.\\n\\nTools to deal with anxiety,\\n\\ntools to deal with stress ranging again from behavioral\\n\\nto nutritional, supplement-based, et cetera.\\n\\nThat of course is not justification for going out\\n\\nand drinking so much that you get anxiety induced hangover.\\n\\nBut for those of you that are experiencing\\n\\npost-alcohol consumption anxiety, as it were,\\n\\nthat could be a useful resource\\n\\nbecause I certainly don't want anyone\\n\\nexperiencing uncomfortable amounts of anxiety.\\n\\nAnd there are great tools and resources for that.\\n\\nNow, the other aspects of hangover,\\n\\nsuch as the stomach ache or headache\\n\\nor feelings of malaise or fogginess,\\n\\nthose can be related to a number of different things\\n\\nand probably are related to a number of different things.\\n\\nFirst of all, the sleep that one gets after even just one,\\n\\nyes, even just one glass of wine or a beer\\n\\nis not the same sleep that you get\\n\\nwhen you don't have alcohol circulating in your system.\\n\\nAnd not trying to be a downer here,\\n\\nbut this was discussed in the Huberman Lab podcast episode\\n\\nwhere I had Dr. Matthew Walker from UC Berkeley on.\\n\\nAnd of course, Dr. Walker is a world expert in sleep,\\n\\nruns one of the preeminent laboratories\\n\\nstudying sleep and its effects,\\n\\nwrote the incredible book, Why We Sleep, and so on.\\n\\nDr. Walker told me, and it certainly is supported\\n\\nby lots and lots of quality peer-reviewed studies\\n\\nin animals and in humans,\\n\\nthat when alcohol is present in the brain and bloodstream,\\n\\nthat the architecture of sleep is disruptive.\\n\\nSlow wave sleep, deep sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep,\\n\\nall of which are essential\\n\\nfor getting a restorative night's sleep are all disrupted.\\n\\nSo for those of you that are drinking a glass or two of wine\\n\\nor having a hard liquor drink or a beer\\n\\nin order to fall asleep,\\n\\nthe sleep you're getting is simply not high quality sleep\\n\\nor certainly not as high quality as the sleep you'd be getting\\n\\nif you did not have alcohol in your system.\\n\\nOf course, when we're talking about hangover,\\n\\nwe're talking generally about the consumption\\n\\nof more than just one or two drinks.\\n\\nOf course, for some people,\\n\\none or two drinks is probably sufficient\\n\\nto induce hangover, but for most people,\\n\\nit's going to be having three or four,\\n\\nexceeding their typical limit, as it's called.\\n\\nAgain, not the legal limit, that's a whole other business.\\n\\nBut when one ingests too much alcohol for them,\\n\\none of the reasons they feel terrible the next day\\n\\nis because their sleep isn't really good sleep.\\n\\nIn fact, it's not even sleep,\\n\\nit's often considered pseudo sleep,\\n\\nor at least that's what it's called\\n\\nin the sleep science field,\\n\\nbecause people are in kind of a low level hypnotic\\n\\nkind of trance, it's not real sleep,\\n\\nthere are multiple bouts of waking up,\\n\\nthey may not even realize they're waking up multiple times.\\n\\nOkay, so there's the sleep-induced effects.\\n\\nThen there are the disrupted gut microbiome effects,\\n\\nsome of which we talked about earlier,\\n\\nso now you understand the mechanism\\n\\nof alcohol destroying good, healthy gut microbiota,\\n\\nwhich then leads to leaky gut and things of that sort.\\n\\nBut one could imagine, again, could imagine,\\n\\nand there is some evidence starting to support this,\\n\\nthat again, ingesting low sugar fermented foods\\n\\nor maybe in prebiotic or probiotics\\n\\nto support the gut microbiome\\n\\nmight assist in some of the gut related malaise\\n\\nassociated with hangover.\\n\\nIn other words, get those gut microbiota healthy again,\\n\\nas quickly as possible, or maybe even before you drink,\\n\\nhave those gut microbiota healthy,\\n\\nI would hope that you would do that.\\n\\nI think everybody should be doing something\\n\\nto support their gut microbiome,\\n\\nwhether or not it's the ingestion\\n\\nof low sugar fermented foods daily,\\n\\nor at least on a regular basis,\\n\\nor ingestion of probiotic or prebiotic.\\n\\nThe gut microbiome is so important\\n\\nfor so many different things.\\n\\nIn terms of hangover and headache,\\n\\nwe know that that's caused by vasoconstriction,\\n\\nthe constriction of blood vessels\\n\\nthat tends to occur as a rebound after a night of drinking.\\n\\nAlcohol can act as a vasodilator,\\n\\nit can dilate the blood vessels.\\n\\nPart of that is associated with the increase\\n\\nin so-called parasympathetic tone.\\n\\nWe have an autonomic nervous system,\\n\\nit's got a sympathetic component.\\n\\nThese are neurons that make us more alert,\\n\\nand if they're very active, they make us very stressed.\\n\\nThere's also the parasympathetic aspect\\n\\nof the autonomic nervous system.\\n\\nThis is all just fancy geek speak\\n\\nfor the parts of your brain and body,\\n\\nthe nerve cells that make you very relaxed.\\n\\nWhen you're very relaxed, there tends to be vasodilation.\\n\\nIt allows for more movement of blood and other things\\n\\nthrough the bloodstream,\\n\\nand alcohol tends to induce some vasodilation,\\n\\nat least in some of the capillary beds.\\n\\nAnd then when the alcohol wears off,\\n\\nthere's vasoconstriction, and people get brutal headaches.\\n\\nThat's why some people will take aspirin or Tylenol,\\n\\nor Advil, or things like that,\\n\\nthe sort of non-steroid anti-inflammatories.\\n\\nI should mention, there's a lot of literature coming out\\n\\nthat some of these non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs\\n\\nare not good for us for a number of different reasons,\\n\\nthe way they impact the liver,\\n\\nthe way they impact the immune system,\\n\\nand, no surprise, the way they impact the gut microbiome.\\n\\nSo I'm not one to tell you\\n\\nwhat medications to take or not take,\\n\\nbut you certainly would want to do a quick web search\\n\\nof effects of non-steroid anti-inflammatories and aspirin\\n\\nbefore you start taking those,\\n\\nor stop taking those for that matter.\\n\\nGenerally, they will alleviate headache,\\n\\nbut they can often have other issues,\\n\\nincluding liver issues.\\n\\nAnd keep in mind, the night after drinking,\\n\\nyour liver has already taken a beating\\n\\nbecause of the need of the liver to convert alcohol\\n\\nfrom acetylaldehyde into acetate,\\n\\nwhich is now a pathway that you well understand.\\n\\nSo I'm not certain, and in fact,\\n\\nI believe it's not the greatest idea\\n\\nto burden your liver further through the use of things\\n\\nthat are going to cause it to have to work harder\\n\\nand metabolize things\\n\\nif the goal is simply to alleviate a headache.\\n\\nThere's a lot of kind of lore,\\n\\nold school lore about how to relieve a hangover.\\n\\nWe already talked about how eating food won't do that,\\n\\nbut eating food will prevent the rapid absorption\\n\\nof even more alcohol into the bloodstream.\\n\\nThere's the lore that one should simply ingest more alcohol.\\n\\nWhat terrible advice that is.\\n\\nThat's just going to delay an even worse hangover.\\n\\nHowever, I'd be remiss if I didn't say\\n\\nthat the reason that that myth came to be,\\n\\nor that I should say that truth came to be,\\n\\nbecause indeed ingesting more alcohol\\n\\nwill alleviate a hangover,\\n\\nbut then a worse hangover will show up.\\n\\nThe reason that came to be is because ingestion\\n\\nmore alcohol will cause those constricted vessels\\n\\nthat are giving the headache to dilate again.\\n\\nBut of course, ingesting more alcohol\\n\\nto relieve a hangover is simply a bad idea.\\n\\nJust don't do it.\\n\\nI think this is called the hair of the dog approach.\\n\\nMaybe someone can put in the show note captions\\n\\non YouTube, why it's called the hair of the dog.\\n\\nI can come up with a few ideas,\\n\\nbut they're not going to be very good ones.\\n\\nAnd some of them would probably even be outright ridiculous.\\n\\nSo do not ingest more alcohol simply to try\\n\\nand recover from a hangover.\\n\\nI know many people have tried that one before,\\n\\nbut that's a terrible idea.\\n\\nNow, one thing that you'll also hear out there\\n\\nis that deliberate cold exposure,\\n\\nfor instance, taking a cold shower might relieve hangover.\\n\\nI find this one particularly interesting\\n\\nbecause we've done episodes\\n\\non the benefits of deliberate cold exposure.\\n\\nWe have an entire episode about that.\\n\\nYou can find it again, hubermanlab.com.\\n\\nThere are direct links to some of the tools\\n\\nrelated to deliberate cold exposure.\\n\\nAnd we have an entire newsletter\\n\\non deliberate cold exposure protocols.\\n\\nYou can find on hubermanlab.com,\\n\\ngo to our neural network newsletter.\\n\\nSo those of you that are interested in ice baths\\n\\nand cold showers and ways to leverage those,\\n\\nyou can find that there.\\n\\nWhat you won't find there is a description\\n\\nof how to use deliberate cold exposure\\n\\nfor sake of treating hangover.\\n\\nBut here I went into the literature\\n\\nand I found something kind of interesting.\\n\\nThere is some evidence that increasing levels\\n\\nof epinephrine in the bloodstream\\n\\ncan actually help with alcohol clearance.\\n\\nThat was very surprising to me.\\n\\nAnd I want to point out this is not a large\\n\\nand robust literature, but there's some evidence\\n\\npointing to the fact that when levels of epinephrine,\\n\\nadrenaline are raised in the brain and bloodstream,\\n\\nthat some of the components of alcohol metabolism\\n\\ncan be accelerated and some of the inebriating effects\\n\\nof alcohol can be reduced.\\n\\nSo maybe this old school lore of taking a cold shower\\n\\nactually has something to it.\\n\\nSo in thinking about the use of deliberate cold exposure\\n\\nin order to reduce the effects of hangover\\n\\nor to more rapidly clear alcohol\\n\\nfrom the brain and bloodstream,\\n\\nI want to be very clear\\n\\nand I want to emphasize your safety.\\n\\nThe way to do that is to understand\\n\\nthat alcohol lowers core body temperature, okay?\\n\\nIt can make people slightly hypothermic.\\n\\nIt's going to drop core body temperature.\\n\\nSo if you were inebriated and you went\\n\\nand got into a body of water, right?\\n\\nA pool or a lake or something,\\n\\nfirst of all, that's extremely dangerous to do\\n\\nwhile you're inebriated, right?\\n\\nPeople drown all the time.\\n\\nPeople drown, they die as a consequence of doing that.\\n\\nSo please don't do that.\\n\\nBut also if it's a very cold water,\\n\\nyour core body temperature is going to drop even further.\\n\\nNow, if you've heard the episodes\\n\\nthat I've done on deliberate cold exposure,\\n\\npreviously I've talked about how normally\\n\\nwhen people are not ingesting alcohol,\\n\\nthey get into an ice bath or a cold shower\\n\\nand their body temperature initially dips,\\n\\nbut then it rebounds and increases.\\n\\nThat's a process that's going to occur\\n\\nwhen people do not have alcohol in their system.\\n\\nWhen you have alcohol in your system,\\n\\none of the reasons that you become hypothermic\\n\\nis because there's a disruption\\n\\nin those hypothalamic brain areas,\\n\\nin particular the brain area called the medial preoptic area\\n\\nthat regulates core body temperature.\\n\\nSo it's not so much that alcohol makes you cold,\\n\\nit's that alcohol disrupts the central command centers\\n\\nof the brain that control temperature regulation\\n\\nand that leads you to be slightly hypothermic.\\n\\nSo if you then go get into a very cold lake\\n\\nor you get into even a cold shower or an ice bath,\\n\\nthere's the possibility of you going very, very far\\n\\ndown the ladder into very hypothermic territory\\n\\nand that can be very dangerous.\\n\\nNow, in terms of dealing with hangover\\n\\nwhen the alcohol has been largely cleared from your system,\\n\\nwell, that's where some of this kind of old lore combines\\n\\nwith some of the modern science and says,\\n\\nwell, if you can spike adrenaline\\n\\nand certainly getting into an ice bath\\n\\nor getting into a cold shower\\n\\nor any kind of cold body of water,\\n\\nprovided you can do that safely,\\n\\nthat will sharply increase your adrenaline\\n\\nand I should say your dopamine, that's been shown\\n\\nand we've talked about this on the podcast before,\\n\\nyou get these long extended increases,\\n\\nseveral hours of increases in dopamine\\n\\nfrom deliberate cold exposure.\\n\\nIt's well documented in humans, by the way.\\n\\nSo one could imagine using deliberate cold exposure\\n\\nas a way to accelerate the recovery from hangover.\\n\\nProvided that's done safely,\\n\\nI think there's no reason to not explore that\\n\\nand if you wonder what safely is\\n\\nand what temperatures to use,\\n\\nplease check out the episode on deliberate cold exposure.\\n\\nCold showers therefore might actually be one way\\n\\nto at least partially relieve hangover.\\n\\nCertainly the science from various places\\n\\nin the literature converge to say that,\\n\\nbut again, be careful, please, please, please be careful\\n\\nnot to get into cold water when you are inebriated.\\n\\nIt's absolutely dangerous for all the obvious reasons\\n\\nand it's dangerous also for the non-obvious reasons,\\n\\nnot the least of which is the dramatic decreases\\n\\nin core body temperature\\n\\nthat can make you dangerously hypothermic.\\n\\nNow, how would you go about using deliberate cold exposure\\n\\nto accelerate recovery from hangover?\\n\\nWell, there I would look to the kind of standard protocols\\n\\nof one to three minutes or maybe even six minutes\\n\\nif you can tolerate or if you're really cold adapted,\\n\\nif you do seven or 10 minutes in a cold shower,\\n\\nalthough that could be a lot.\\n\\nMost people are going to experience a sharp increase\\n\\nin epinephrine and adrenaline\\n\\nand a long lasting increase in dopamine\\n\\nfrom one to three minutes of deliberate cold exposure,\\n\\nideally done immersion up to the neck.\\n\\nAgain, do this safely, please, please, please\\n\\nor a cold shower where you're getting under the shower\\n\\nas much as possible.\\n\\nHow cold?\\n\\nThat's going to vary person to person.\\n\\nI suggest making it as cold as is uncomfortable\\n\\nsuch that you really want to get out,\\n\\nbut then you know you can stay in safely\\n\\nwithout for instance, giving yourself a heart attack\\n\\nbecause if the water is really, really cold,\\n\\nof course you can give yourself a heart attack.\\n\\nMost showers won't go that cold,\\n\\nalthough probably some will.\\n\\nAgain, please use caution, spike your adrenaline,\\n\\nspike your dopamine with deliberate cold exposure safely.\\n\\nOther components of hangover that could be good targets\\n\\nfor trying to alleviate hangover,\\n\\nand here I hope you are getting the picture\\n\\nbecause it is accurate to say that hangover\\n\\nis a multifaceted phenomenon.\\n\\nIt's not like one molecule in one receptor.\\n\\nIt's a bunch of things happening in the brain and body,\\n\\nbut is the dehydration associated with alcohol.\\n\\nAlcohol is a diuretic for multiple reasons.\\n\\nIt causes people to excrete not only water,\\n\\nbut also sodium.\\n\\nSodium is an electrolyte critical\\n\\nfor the function of neurons.\\n\\nSo making sure that you have enough sodium,\\n\\npotassium and magnesium, so-called electrolytes\\n\\nis going to be important for proper brain function,\\n\\nbodily organ function.\\n\\nEven for people that have just had one or two drinks\\n\\nthe night before, it's likely that your electrolyte balance\\n\\nand your fluid balance is going to be disrupted,\\n\\nand that's because alcohol also disrupts\\n\\nthe so-called vasopressin pathway.\\n\\nI talked a lot about vasopressin\\n\\nand the way that it interacts with\\n\\nand controls different aspects of water retention\\n\\nand water release from the body in the form of urine\\n\\nin the episode on salt.\\n\\nSo again, I'm referring to hubermanlab.com\\n\\nas the site where you can find that episode\\n\\non salt balance and ways to restore electrolyte balance.\\n\\nHaving your electrolytes at the proper levels\\n\\nbefore you drink is ideal.\\n\\nSome people will say for every glass of alcohol\\n\\nthat you drink, you should drink one glass of water.\\n\\nI would say better would be two glasses of water,\\n\\ngiven the dehydrating effects of alcohol,\\n\\nand even better would be water with electrolytes.\\n\\nThat certainly would set you up\\n\\nfor a better day the next day.\\n\\nIf you don't manage to do that,\\n\\nbecause I suppose it's kind of geeky\\n\\nwalking around with electrolyte packets out at the bar\\n\\nor whatnot, although geeky in my book is a good thing,\\n\\nthe next day you could take some electrolytes upon waking,\\n\\nmaybe even some before you go to sleep\\n\\nat the night of drinking.\\n\\nSo hangovers made worse by disturbed sleep,\\n\\nmade worse by disrupted gut microbiome,\\n\\nmade worse by disrupted electrolytes,\\n\\nmade worse by the depletion of epinephrine and dopamine.\\n\\nThat's why replenishing the microbiome with fermented foods,\\n\\nlow-sugar fermented foods, that is.\\n\\nThat's why using safe deliberate cold exposure\\n\\nfor spiking adrenaline and for increasing dopamine.\\n\\nAnd that's why consuming electrolytes\\n\\nare all going to be beneficial.\\n\\nThe folks over at examine.com, a website that I really like\\n\\nbecause it just has so much useful information,\\n\\nhave assembled a list of things\\n\\nthat have been proposed, purported to improve,\\n\\nor I should say to remove the effects of hangover.\\n\\nAnd as they point out, and I would like to point out\\n\\nover there, there isn't a lot of quality science\\n\\nto support the idea that any one compound\\n\\ncan eliminate hangover.\\n\\nAnd that's probably because hangover, again,\\n\\narises from multiple organs and tissues and systems\\n\\nin both the brain and body.\\n\\nNonetheless, they have a terrific list over there of things,\\n\\neverything from Japanese pear fruit juice\\n\\nhas been proposed to do this\\n\\nto some other really esoteric things,\\n\\neven things like yohimbine.\\n\\nFrankly, when I look at the literature there and elsewhere,\\n\\none simply cannot find the magic substance,\\n\\nthe one herb, the one potion that can wipe away hangover.\\n\\nGetting rid of hangover is going to be best solved\\n\\nby doing a collection of a small number\\n\\nof very powerful things,\\n\\nof which I've already listed off a few.\\n\\nHowever, there are some additional things\\n\\nthat one can do for relieving hangover.\\n\\nAnd one of them is to be very thoughtful\\n\\nabout what sorts of alcohol one consumes.\\n\\nSo I find this interesting.\\n\\nThere have actually been studies\\n\\nof which types of alcohol lead to the greatest hangovers.\\n\\nThere's actually a lot of legend and lore\\n\\nabout this as well.\\n\\nSome people have said, for instance,\\n\\nthat drinks that have a high sugar content\\n\\nlead to greater hangovers.\\n\\nTurns out that's not the case,\\n\\nor at least that's not what the science points to.\\n\\nIf you look at the expected hangover severity,\\n\\nwhat you find is that at the bottom end of the scale,\\n\\nthere's a drink that I'm not going to tell you\\n\\nfor the moment,\\n\\nbut what you find is that near it is, for instance, beer.\\n\\nThe consumption of beer,\\n\\nprovided it is not over consumption, right?\\n\\nIt's not far beyond the tolerance of the individual.\\n\\nSo there's one or two beers\\n\\nis less likely to cause a hangover than say whiskey.\\n\\nAnd a glass of whiskey or I should,\\n\\nnot as much whiskey as beer, of course,\\n\\nbut a glass of whiskey, for instance,\\n\\nis more likely to cause hangover than gin,\\n\\nas it turns out.\\n\\nAgain, this is what's fallen out of the data.\\n\\nAnd yet a glass of rum or red wine\\n\\nis more likely to cause a hangover\\n\\nthan any of the other things I've mentioned.\\n\\nAt the top, top, top of the list of drinks\\n\\nthat induce hangover is brandy.\\n\\nAnd one could then say,\\n\\nwell, doesn't brandy have a lot of sugar?\\n\\nMaybe it's the sugar that's causing hangovers.\\n\\nAnd this is something that's been, again,\\n\\ndiscussed over and over that people say,\\n\\noh, it's the high sugar drinks that cause hangover.\\n\\nIt turns out, however, that when one looks at drinks,\\n\\nalcoholic drinks and sugar content and hangover,\\n\\nat the very bottom of the list is,\\n\\ngosh, this makes me cringe just to think about,\\n\\nis ethanol diluted in orange juice.\\n\\nI can't believe people actually drink this.\\n\\nBut ethanol diluted in orange juice.\\n\\nSo this is not vodka in orange juice, okay?\\n\\nVodka was third on the list from the bottom\\n\\nof drinks that induce hangover.\\n\\nAgain, this is within amounts that are comfortable\\n\\nfor the person to drink,\\n\\nthat they have enough experience with\\n\\nor that they have the body weight to tolerate\\n\\nwithout getting very, very drunk.\\n\\nSo the point is that if it were sugar\\n\\nthat's causing hangover,\\n\\nwell, then the ethanol diluted in orange juice\\n\\nwould probably be at the top of the list\\n\\nin terms of inducing hangover,\\n\\nbut it's not, it's at the bottom of the list.\\n\\nAnd brandy is at the top of the list.\\n\\nSo what you find is that what scales\\n\\nfrom ethanol diluted in orange juice\\n\\nto beer, to vodka, to gin,\\n\\nhere I'm ascending the hierarchy of things\\n\\nthat cause hangover.\\n\\nGin, white wine, whiskey, rum, red wine,\\n\\nand then brandy at the peak,\\n\\nit's sort of the world heavyweight champion\\n\\nof hangover inducing drinks.\\n\\nWell, what's increasing are congeners within those drinks.\\n\\nCongeners are things like nitrites\\n\\nand other substances that give alcohol\\n\\nits distinctive flavor\\n\\nand that also lead to some of the inebriating effects\\n\\nof alcohol.\\n\\nNow, then you ask, okay, well, what is it\\n\\nthat these congeners are doing\\n\\nand what are these nitrites doing?\\n\\nAnd guess what?\\n\\nWhile they do have effects on the brain\\n\\nand on other tissues,\\n\\ntheir main effects are to disrupt the gut microbiome.\\n\\nSo what this points to again,\\n\\nis that having a healthy gut microbiome\\n\\nand perhaps ensuring that you bolster your gut microbiome\\n\\nthe day after drinking is going to be especially important\\n\\nfor warding off hangover\\n\\nor at least reducing the effects of hangover\\n\\nor the symptoms of hangover or both.\\n\\nI would love to see a study on this.\\n\\nI could imagine designing the study myself,\\n\\nalthough this isn't really the sorts of things\\n\\nmy laboratory does,\\n\\nbut you can imagine some people getting probiotic\\n\\nand prebiotic, some regularly,\\n\\nsome just after drinking or low sugar fermented foods\\n\\nand see what the effects are\\n\\nin terms of subjective effects of hangover,\\n\\nbut also some physiological measures.\\n\\nI think the way to think about hangover overall\\n\\nis that again, it represents a multifaceted,\\n\\nmulti-organ, multi-tissue phenomenon.\\n\\nAnd the best way to deal with it\\n\\nis as a multi-cell, multi-tissue, multi-chemical phenomenon.\\n\\nAnd before I listed off some of the things\\n\\nthat one could do in order to adjust hangover,\\n\\nagain, the one that comes out at the top of that list,\\n\\nI believe at least based on my read of the data\\n\\nis to support the gut microbiome\\n\\nand certainly not to ingest more alcohol.\\n\\nAnd I suppose if we were to get really honest\\n\\nwith one another and ask what's the best way\\n\\nto avoid a hangover,\\n\\nit would be to not drink in the first place.\\n\\nSo we've covered the major effects of alcohol\\n\\nthat lead to this state that we call drunkenness\\n\\nor inebriation.\\n\\nAgain, there's a range there.\\n\\nYou can be tipsy, people can be blackout drunk,\\n\\npeople can be passed out drunk.\\n\\nWe've also talked about hangover\\n\\nand the fact that it's a multifaceted phenomenon\\n\\nand recovery from hangover\\n\\ninvolves a multifaceted approach.\\n\\nNext, I want to talk about tolerance.\\n\\nTolerance to alcohol is a very interesting phenomenon.\\n\\nIt has roots mainly in the brain and in brain systems.\\n\\nThere's not time in the world,\\n\\nlet alone within this podcast\\n\\nto get into all the aspects of tolerance.\\n\\nThere are more than 10 different types of tolerance.\\n\\nThere's functional tolerance,\\n\\nchronic tolerance, rapid tolerance,\\n\\nthere's metabolic tolerance,\\n\\nthere's psychological tolerance.\\n\\nLet's keep it simple for sake of today's discussion.\\n\\nAnd for those of you that are interested in learning\\n\\nabout all the different types of tolerance\\n\\nand aspects of tolerance,\\n\\nthere's an excellent review.\\n\\nWe will provide a link to this.\\n\\nThis was published in 2021, so it's pretty recent\\n\\nin the journal, Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior.\\n\\nIncidentally, or not so incidentally,\\n\\nthat was the first journal I ever published in.\\n\\nSo I have a particular affection for that journal.\\n\\nNonetheless, it is called Tolerance to Alcohol,\\n\\na Critical Yet Understudied Factor in Alcohol Addiction.\\n\\nAnd while this paper does include alcohol addiction\\n\\nin the title, it's not just about alcohol addiction.\\n\\nHere's the basic summary of what tolerance is.\\n\\nFirst of all, tolerance refers to the reduced effects\\n\\nof alcohol with repeated exposure.\\n\\nAnd it is caused mainly by changes\\n\\nin neurotransmitter systems in the brain\\n\\nthat are the direct consequence of the toxicity of alcohol,\\n\\nthat aldehyde molecule that we talked about before.\\n\\nThere's enormous number of chemicals\\n\\nthat change with repeated exposure to acetyl aldehyde,\\n\\neverything from GABA to dopamine to serotonin,\\n\\nsecond messenger systems, adenosine, and on and on.\\n\\nRather than go into each of those in detail,\\n\\nI just want to talk about the contour of the reinforcing\\n\\nand the tolerance-inducing effects of alcohol.\\n\\nWhat do I mean by that?\\n\\nWell, here we are back to our old friend,\\n\\nmeaning the molecule that comes up over and over again\\n\\nin these podcast episodes, which is dopamine.\\n\\nWhether or not somebody has a predisposition alcoholism\\n\\nor not, whether or not they're experienced drinker or not,\\n\\nwhen people initially start drinking,\\n\\nthere are increases in dopamine\\n\\nor what we call dopaminergic transmission.\\n\\nDopamine is involved in motivation, craving,\\n\\nit creates a sense of wellbeing, it increases energy.\\n\\nAgain, typically only at the beginning of alcohol exposure.\\n\\nThat occurs in most people as a sharp spike, as a increase.\\n\\nAgain, if somebody does not have alcohol dehydrogenase\\n\\nor has very low levels of the enzyme\\n\\nthat convert that acetyl aldide into acetate\\n\\nand the metabolized alcohol, in other words,\\n\\nthey will feel sick and lousy in a way that will override\\n\\nany recognition of the dopamine release.\\n\\nThey're going to be the people that are listening to this\\n\\nand just think, alcohol just makes me feel sick.\\n\\nI don't like it.\\n\\nOkay, that's a specific subcategory of people,\\n\\nbut most people experience some sort of mild euphoria.\\n\\nThat's why so many people drink, right?\\n\\nThe current estimates are that in most countries\\n\\nand certainly in the US, as many as 80%\\n\\nof the adult legal drinking age population drinks alcohol.\\n\\nAnd that number could be even higher now\\n\\nbecause in the last couple of years\\n\\nhas been a trend towards increased alcohol consumption,\\n\\nespecially in the wake of the pandemic\\n\\nand during the pandemic topic for another time.\\n\\nSo there's an increase in dopamine\\n\\nand an increase in serotonin.\\n\\nSo it's kind of an increase in wellbeing,\\n\\nan increase in mood, but it's a very short-lived increase.\\n\\nVery soon after and actually triggered by that increase\\n\\nis a long and slow reduction in dopamine and serotonin\\n\\nand related molecules and circuits.\\n\\nSo basically what you're getting is a blip of feel good\\n\\nfollowed by a long, slow arc of feeling not so great,\\n\\nwhich is why typically people will drink again and again\\n\\nacross the night.\\n\\nThe key thing to understand about tolerance\\n\\nis that with tolerance, the duration of that long,\\n\\nslow reduction in dopamine and serotonin gets even longer.\\n\\nIn other words, the negative effects of alcohol\\n\\nthat happened after the initial feeling good\\n\\nextend longer and in fact get more robust.\\n\\nHowever, there's also a reduction\\n\\nin the reinforcing properties of alcohol.\\n\\nThere's a shrinking of the feel good blip that happens\\n\\nwhen one first ingests alcohol.\\n\\nAnd this has been measured in animals and humans.\\n\\nSo the first drink that somebody has provided\\n\\nthey have enough alcohol dehydrogenase\\n\\nthat doesn't make them feel nauseous and sick right away,\\n\\nthey feel really good.\\n\\nAnd then as it wears off, they feel kind of lousy\\n\\nand they want to drink more.\\n\\nSo they might drink more.\\n\\nWith each subsequent drink and even drinks\\n\\non different nights or even different weeks,\\n\\nthe amount of dopamine that's released is reduced.\\n\\nThe amount of serotonin that's released is reduced.\\n\\nSo what you're getting is less and less\\n\\nof the reinforcing properties of alcohol.\\n\\nThe feel good stuff and more and more\\n\\nof the punishment pain signal aspects of alcohol.\\n\\nThis is the contour of chemical release in the brain\\n\\nthat was referred to by my colleague,\\n\\nthe incredible Dr. Anna Lemke, who's a medical doctor.\\n\\nShe wrote the incredible book, Dopamine Nation.\\n\\nShe was a guest on this podcast, on Joe Rogan's podcast,\\n\\non Rich Roll's podcast and several other podcasts,\\n\\nworld expert in addiction.\\n\\nAnd she talked about this pleasure pain balance\\n\\nthat extends beyond alcohol to things like sex\\n\\nand gambling and to other behaviors\\n\\nthat can potentially become addictive,\\n\\nbut certainly includes alcohol.\\n\\nSo tolerance, it seems, is a process\\n\\nin which people are ingesting more and more alcohol\\n\\nas an attempt to get that feeling of wellbeing back.\\n\\nBut what they're really getting is an extended period\\n\\nof punishment, of pain and of malaise from the alcohol.\\n\\nNow you might say, well, how does that relate to tolerance?\\n\\nWell, it turns out what they do behaviorally.\\n\\nAnd when I say they, I mean, animals do this\\n\\nand humans do this, is they start drinking more and more\\n\\nin an attempt to activate those dopamine\\n\\nand serotonin neurons and receptors.\\n\\nAnd as they do that,\\n\\nthere is an increase in alcohol dehydrogeny.\\n\\nSo the enzyme that metabolizes alcohol is increased\\n\\nbecause the body and liver have to contend\\n\\nwith all that alcohol.\\n\\nSo now you've got, again, the two-hit model.\\n\\nYou're getting less of the feel-good chemicals,\\n\\nmore of the negative chemical release\\n\\nor pattern of subjective feeling, I should say.\\n\\nAnd you're metabolizing alcohol more quickly\\n\\nand more readily, but it's not taking you to a better place\\n\\nin terms of how you feel.\\n\\nThat's one of the major underlying reasons\\n\\nfor what we call tolerance.\\n\\nSo if you're somebody who drinks and you notice\\n\\nthat the feeling that you are seeking with alcohol\\n\\nis now requiring an additional drink or drinks, plural,\\n\\nchances are you are disrupting the dopamine\\n\\nand serotonergic systems of your brain.\\n\\nAnd you are doing that in a way that is increasing\\n\\nthe pain and punishment signals\\n\\nthat follow alcohol ingestion.\\n\\nAnd again, that's not just on the night that you're drinking\\n\\nbut afterwards as well.\\n\\nIs that all bad news?\\n\\nWell, pretty much, but the good news is\\n\\nthat if you abstain from drinking for some period of time,\\n\\nthen of course these systems reset.\\n\\nHow long you need to abstain will depend\\n\\non how much you were drinking\\n\\nand how long you were drinking for.\\n\\nCertainly people who have alcohol use disorder,\\n\\nwho are alcoholics, their main goal should be\\n\\nto quit alcohol completely.\\n\\nI know there's some debate about this\\n\\nand I don't want to get into that debate\\n\\nbecause I'm certainly not going to try\\n\\nand direct anyone's recovery.\\n\\nThere are expert counselors and MDs\\n\\nand people that can work with people.\\n\\nIn fact, for some very heavy drinkers\\n\\nand people with serious alcohol use disorder\\n\\ngoing cold turkey that is stopping drinking completely\\n\\ncan actually be medically dangerous.\\n\\nSo the path to sobriety for certain people\\n\\nlooks different than the path to sobriety for other people.\\n\\nWhat I'm referring to here are people that are ingesting\\n\\nagain somewhere between on average,\\n\\none to two drinks per night,\\n\\nwhether or not that's done night to night\\n\\nor whether or not that's condensed to weekend use.\\n\\nI know a number of people are going to ask,\\n\\nperhaps are screaming, is drinking good for me in any way?\\n\\nFor instance, many people have probably heard\\n\\nthat resveratrol is good for people\\n\\nand that red wine is enriched in resveratrol.\\n\\nI hate to break it to you, but the reality is\\n\\nthat if indeed resveratrol is good for us\\n\\nand there's some debate about this,\\n\\nsome people say strongly yes, some people say no,\\n\\nother people say maybe, the amount of red wine\\n\\nthat one would have to drink\\n\\nin order to get enough resveratrol\\n\\nin order for it to be health promoting\\n\\nis so outrageously high that it would surely\\n\\ninduce other negative effects\\n\\nthat would offset the positive effects of resveratrol.\\n\\nSo I wish I could tell you different.\\n\\nAgain, I'm not here to be the bearer of bad news,\\n\\nbut the statement I just made was confirmed\\n\\nby Dr. David Sinclair when he was a guest on this podcast.\\n\\nIt's confirmed by other researchers\\n\\nwho work on resveratrol and related pathways.\\n\\nI wish I could tell you that red wine is good\\n\\nfor your health and indeed it might be\\n\\nthrough some other mechanisms.\\n\\nSo for instance, there have been studies\\n\\nof low to moderate red wine consumption.\\n\\nThis would be anywhere from one to four glasses per week\\n\\nand I don't mean enormous glasses,\\n\\nI mean six ounce glasses of red wine.\\n\\nAnd in those cases, some of the stress reduction\\n\\nthat can be induced by consumption of red wine,\\n\\nmaybe some of the other micronutrients and components\\n\\nwithin red wines, in particular red wines\\n\\nthat come from particular grapes\\n\\nand this gets really nuanced and frankly\\n\\nis not well worked out in the peer reviewed literature,\\n\\ncertainly not clinical trials,\\n\\nat least not that I'm aware of.\\n\\nTell me if you're aware of a great clinical trial on this.\\n\\nWell, there may be some positive effects\\n\\nof that very low level of consumption.\\n\\nI'm not trying to take away anybody's red wine,\\n\\nI'm not trying to take away anybody's anything.\\n\\nI would be remiss however, if I didn't tell you\\n\\nthat resveratrol as the argument for drinking\\n\\nand drinking red wine in particular is just not a good one.\\n\\nIt's just not supported by the peer reviewed research.\\n\\nA few other things about alcohol and health.\\n\\nAt the beginning of the episode,\\n\\nI referenced a study showing that indeed\\n\\nnot just heavy alcohol consumption\\n\\nof 12 to 24 or more drinks per week,\\n\\nbut also light to moderate alcohol consumption\\n\\nof any type, wine, beer, spirits, et cetera,\\n\\ndoes reduce the thickness of the brain.\\n\\nIt really does reduce cortical thickness.\\n\\nIn fact, it actually scales with the amount of alcohol\\n\\nthat people drink and this has been well documented\\n\\nin a number of different studies.\\n\\nI can provide a link to several of these.\\n\\nOne of the more striking ones actually shows\\n\\nthat there's almost a dose dependent increase\\n\\nin shrinkage of the gray matter volume\\n\\nand in these white matter tracks, these axons,\\n\\nthese wires as it would that connect different neurons\\n\\nas a function of how much alcohol people drink.\\n\\nAnd that's also what's been seen in this recent study\\n\\nthat I referenced at the beginning\\n\\nand that's in the show note captions.\\n\\nSo again, probably the best amount of alcohol to drink\\n\\nwould be zero glasses per week or ounces per week.\\n\\nFor those of you drinking low amounts of alcohol,\\n\\nmake sure you're doing other things to promote your health.\\n\\nAnd for those of you that are drinking moderate\\n\\nand certainly for those of you that are heavy drinkers,\\n\\nplease do everything you can to move away from that\\n\\nand to quit entirely.\\n\\nBut even for the moderate consumers of alcohol,\\n\\nyou are going to want to be aware\\n\\nof some of the negative health effects\\n\\nand do things to offset those\\n\\nif indeed you're not going to stop drinking\\n\\nor reduce your intake.\\n\\nOne of the really bad effects of alcohol,\\n\\nbut that's extremely well documented\\n\\nis the fact that alcohol because of this toxicity\\n\\nof acetyl aldehyde and related pathways\\n\\ncan alter DNA methylation.\\n\\nIt can alter gene expression.\\n\\nThat can be many things in different tissues,\\n\\nbut it is associated with a significant increase\\n\\nin cancer risk, in particular, breast cancer.\\n\\nAnd in particular, because breast tissue\\n\\nis present in both males and females,\\n\\nbut in women, it's especially vulnerable\\n\\nto some of the DNA methylation changes.\\n\\nWell, breast cancer in women has a relationship\\n\\nto alcohol intake and alcohol intake has a relationship\\n\\nto breast cancer in women.\\n\\nIn fact, there has been proposed to be a anywhere\\n\\nfrom four to 13% increase in risk of breast cancer\\n\\nfor every 10 grams of alcohol consumed.\\n\\nHow much is 10 grams?\\n\\nWell, there we need to think a little bit\\n\\nabout the variation in the amount of alcohol\\n\\nin different drinks across the world.\\n\\nDifferent countries serve different size drinks\\n\\nand have different concentrations of alcohol\\n\\nin those drinks.\\n\\nSo without going down too much of a rabbit hole\\n\\nand just giving you some good rules of thumb to work with,\\n\\nthere've been studies of the percentage of alcohol\\n\\nincluded in different drinks and the sizes\\n\\nof different drinks that are served in different countries.\\n\\nAnd here's a kind of a patchwork of those findings.\\n\\nIn Japan, one beer, one glass of wine,\\n\\nor one shot of liquor as it's served there\\n\\ntends to include anywhere from seven to eight grams\\n\\nof alcohol.\\n\\nIn the U.S., one beer, which generally is 12 ounces,\\n\\nif it's in a bottle,\\n\\none glass of wine or a shot of liquor\\n\\ntends to include about 10 to 12 grams of alcohol.\\n\\nAnd in Russia, one drink of the various sorts\\n\\nthat I just described,\\n\\ntypically will have as much as 24 grams of alcohol\\n\\nbecause of the differences in the concentration of alcohols\\n\\nand the sizes of drinks that are poured\\n\\nin these different countries, okay?\\n\\nOf course, there are other countries in the world.\\n\\nThose countries are also vitally important,\\n\\nbut those are the ones that I extracted from the studies\\n\\nthat I could find.\\n\\nWhat does this mean?\\n\\nWell, what we're talking about is that for every 10 grams\\n\\nof alcohol consumed, so that's one beer in the U.S.,\\n\\nmaybe a little bit more than one beer in Japan,\\n\\nor basically a third of a drink in Russia,\\n\\nthere's a four to 13% increase in risk of cancer.\\n\\nThat's pretty outrageous, right?\\n\\nAnd you might think,\\n\\nwait, how could it be that this stuff is even legal?\\n\\nWell, look, as I described before, it's a toxin.\\n\\nIt's also a toxin that people enjoy the effects of.\\n\\nI mean, in the U.S., at least they tried prohibition.\\n\\nIt certainly did lead, yes, did lead,\\n\\nto a reduction in alcohol-induced health disorders,\\n\\nin particular, cirrhosis of the liver.\\n\\nIt also led to a lot of crime\\n\\nbecause it became a substance\\n\\nthat a lot of people still wanted\\n\\nand that people were willing to break the law\\n\\nin order to provide, or I should say to sell and provide.\\n\\nBut the point is that the more alcohol people drink,\\n\\nthe greater their increase of cancer,\\n\\nin particular, breast cancer.\\n\\nAnd that's because of the fact that alcohol\\n\\nhas these effects on cells\\n\\nthat include changes in gene expression.\\n\\nAnd cancer, that is the growth of tumors,\\n\\nis a dysregulation in cell cycles, right?\\n\\nA tumor is a aggregation or the proliferation.\\n\\nAggregation is stuff sticking together, by the way.\\n\\nProliferation is stuff duplicating.\\n\\nA proliferation and aggregation of cells\\n\\nthat could be a glioma, glial cells, glioma, brain tumor,\\n\\nright, it could be lymphoma,\\n\\nso within the lymph tissue, et cetera.\\n\\nThe mutations that alcohol induces to cause this\\n\\nare wide-ranging.\\n\\nSome of those are starting to start to be understood.\\n\\nFor those of you that are interested in cell biology,\\n\\nI'll just mention that the PD-1 pathway,\\n\\nagain, this is super specialized\\n\\nand for the aficionados only.\\n\\nYou don't need to know this.\\n\\nThe PD-1 pathway seems to be upregulated and,\\n\\nand we knew this from the discussion earlier,\\n\\nthere's a down regulation\\n\\nin some of the anti-inflammatory molecules\\n\\nthat help suppress this proliferation of cancers.\\n\\nNowadays, there's a lot of interest in the fact\\n\\nthat the immune system is constantly combating cancers\\n\\nthat exist in us all the time.\\n\\nYou know, little tumors start growing\\n\\nand our immune system goes and gobbles them up.\\n\\nLittle tumors start growing,\\n\\nthe immune system senses inflammation,\\n\\nsends out these incredible cells,\\n\\nthese killer B cells and T cells and beats them up.\\n\\nCancers proliferate and take hold\\n\\nand cause serious problems\\n\\nwhen the proliferation of cells\\n\\nexceeds the immune system's ability\\n\\nto gobble up and remove those cells.\\n\\nThere are other mechanisms of regulating cancers,\\n\\nbut that's one of the primary one.\\n\\nAnd alcohol hits it, again, it's a two-hit model.\\n\\nIt increases tumor growth\\n\\nand it decreases the sorts of molecules\\n\\nthat suppress and combat tumor growth.\\n\\nSo again, even low to moderate amounts of alcohol\\n\\ncan be problematic for sake of cancers,\\n\\nin particular, breast cancers.\\n\\nEpidemiologists and health specialists\\n\\nlove to try and compare different substances\\n\\nin terms of how bad they are.\\n\\nRarely do they compare substances\\n\\nin terms of how good they are, but sometimes they do.\\n\\nAnd what they'll sometimes tell you\\n\\nand what you can find in the literature\\n\\nis that ingesting 10 to 15 grams of alcohol a day,\\n\\nso that would be like one beer in the US,\\n\\none glass of wine,\\n\\nis the same as smoking 10 cigarettes a day.\\n\\nFrankly, it's hard to make that direct relationship\\n\\nreally stick because it's a question of\\n\\nhow long people inhale,\\n\\ndo they have a predisposition to a lung cancer, et cetera.\\n\\nBut even if that number is off by plus or minus two cigarettes\\n\\nor even if that number would,\\n\\nthe equivalent of one glass of wine\\n\\nequals one cigarette per day,\\n\\nI think there's general consensus now\\n\\nthat nicotine consumed by vaping or by cigarette,\\n\\nit's bad for us in terms of lung cancer\\n\\nand other forms of cancer.\\n\\nAnd for some reason, I don't know why,\\n\\nbecause this knowledge about alcohol and cancer\\n\\nand these established relationships\\n\\nhave been known since the late 1980s.\\n\\nThe first landmark paper on this was published in 1987.\\n\\nI can provide a link to that paper.\\n\\nIt's actually quite interesting to read.\\n\\nWell, the relationship is there\\n\\nand yet we don't often hear about it, right?\\n\\nIn fact, before researching this episode,\\n\\nI had heard before that alcohol can increase cancer risk,\\n\\nbut I wasn't aware of just how strong that relationship is.\\n\\nBecause of the serious nature of what we're talking about\\n\\nand because I would hate to be confusing\\n\\nor misleading to anybody,\\n\\nI want to just emphasize that this statistic\\n\\nthat there is a four to 13%,\\n\\ndepending on which study you look at,\\n\\na four to 13% increase in the risk of cancer,\\n\\nin particular breast cancer,\\n\\nfor every 10 grams of alcohol consumed,\\n\\nthat's 10 grams per day.\\n\\nSo that's one drink per day.\\n\\nBut I do want to emphasize that\\n\\nif that equates to seven drinks per week\\n\\nand all those seven drinks are being consumed\\n\\non Friday and Saturday,\\n\\nit still averages to 10 grams per day.\\n\\nAnd I also want to emphasize\\n\\nthat there are things that people can do\\n\\nto at least partially offset some of the negative effects\\n\\nof alcohol as it relates to predisposition\\n\\nto the formation of certain kinds of tumors and cancers.\\n\\nI also want to be clear before I say it,\\n\\nthat doing the things I'm about to tell you\\n\\nis not a guarantee that you're not going to get cancer,\\n\\nnor is it a guarantee that alcohol\\n\\nis not going to lead to an increased predisposition\\n\\nfor certain kinds of cancers.\\n\\nAnd the two things are consumption of folate\\n\\nand other B vitamins, especially B12.\\n\\nThe consumption of folate and B12\\n\\nhas been shown to decrease cancer risk\\n\\nin people that ingest alcohol,\\n\\nbut not completely offset it.\\n\\nWhy that is, isn't exactly clear.\\n\\nIt probably has something to do with the relationship\\n\\nbetween folate and B12 and other B vitamins\\n\\nin gene regulation pathways that can lead to tumor growth.\\n\\nAt some point soon, we will get an expert in cancer biology\\n\\nand in particular in breast cancer biology on the program.\\n\\nAnd we can ask them about this,\\n\\nbut I realize this is going to raise a number of questions\\n\\nand maybe even cause some of you to go out there\\n\\nand start taking folate and other B vitamins and B12.\\n\\nNot incidentally, a lot of the reported hangover supplements\\n\\nand treatments include folate and B12.\\n\\nI don't know if they had the cancer literature in mind\\n\\nwhen they created those supplements and products.\\n\\nI doubt they did.\\n\\nAlcohol really does disrupt B vitamin pathways,\\n\\nboth synthesis pathways and utilization pathways.\\n\\nSo sometimes you'll hear,\\n\\noh, if you get your B vitamins,\\n\\nit helps you recover from hangover more quickly.\\n\\nAgain, the literature doesn't support that,\\n\\nbut also again, there aren't a lot of studies,\\n\\nbut more to the point as it relates to alcohol\\n\\nand the formation of tumors and cancers,\\n\\nit does appear that decreased folate\\n\\nand other B vitamins like B12 are partially responsible\\n\\nfor the effect of alcohol and increasing cancer risk.\\n\\nAnd it does appear that consuming adequate amounts of folate\\n\\nin B12 might, again, might partially really want to boldface\\n\\nand underline and highlight,\\n\\npartially offset some of that increased risk.\\n\\nThere's an additional category\\n\\nthat I want to highlight, of course,\\n\\nand this is vitally important to state,\\n\\neven though it's obvious,\\n\\nwhich is that people who are pregnant\\n\\nshould absolutely not consume alcohol.\\n\\nFetal alcohol syndrome is well-known and established.\\n\\nIt's terrible.\\n\\nFetuses experience diminished brain development\\n\\nthat's often permanent, diminished limb development,\\n\\ndiminished organ development in the periphery,\\n\\nmeaning the heart, the lungs, the liver, et cetera.\\n\\nIngesting alcohol while pregnant is simply a bad idea.\\n\\nAnd the reason I say this at all is, first of all,\\n\\nit's important to include in an episode like this,\\n\\nbut also because we can look at two things.\\n\\nFirst of all, we can look at mechanism,\\n\\nand then we can also look at some of the lore\\n\\nthat still sadly exists out there.\\n\\nLet's take care of the lore that sadly exists first.\\n\\nIf you look online,\\n\\nyou will sometimes be able to find, sadly,\\n\\nthat some people believe that certain kinds of alcohol\\n\\nare not detrimental to fetuses.\\n\\nThey'll say, well, champagne is safe\\n\\nfor a pregnant mother to drink, but beer is not.\\n\\nThat is absolutely categorically false.\\n\\nAlcohol is alcohol.\\n\\nThere is no evidence whatsoever\\n\\nthat consuming certain types of alcohol\\n\\nis safer for fetuses than others.\\n\\nAlcohol is a toxin,\\n\\nand the reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists\\n\\nis because the ability of that toxin\\n\\nto disrupt cellular processes.\\n\\nRemember tumor growth and the way that alcohol\\n\\ncan accelerate tumor growth by proliferation of cells,\\n\\nthe wrong cells, the ones you don't want to proliferate?\\n\\nWell, all of embryonic development,\\n\\nall of fetal development, it's not the growth of a tumor,\\n\\nit's obviously the growth of an embryo,\\n\\nand it's done in a very orchestrated way.\\n\\nI started off studying brain development.\\n\\nThat's where I got my beginnings in neurobiology,\\n\\nand I still teach embryology to medical students\\n\\nand graduate students.\\n\\nThe set of coordinated processes that has to take place\\n\\nfrom conception to birth in order to give rise\\n\\nto a healthy embryo is so dynamically controlled\\n\\nand so exquisitely precise with checkpoints\\n\\nand recovery mechanisms and redundancy\\n\\nin the genes that are expressed to make sure\\n\\nthat if anything goes wrong, it's repaired, et cetera.\\n\\nAlcohol as a mutagen, I haven't used that word yet,\\n\\nbut a substance that can mutate DNA\\n\\nthrough alterations in DNA methylation\\n\\nand these checkpoints in the cell cycle.\\n\\nAlcohol as a mutagen is one of the worst things\\n\\nthat a developing embryo can be exposed to.\\n\\nAnd again, because it's water-soluble and fat-soluble,\\n\\ningestion of alcohol when people are pregnant\\n\\npasses right to the fetus.\\n\\nNow, I realize that a number of people out there\\n\\nmight be thinking, oh, goodness,\\n\\nI didn't realize I was pregnant\\n\\nuntil a certain stage of pregnancy,\\n\\nand before I realized I was ingesting alcohol.\\n\\nObviously, one can't undo what's been done,\\n\\nbut I want to also emphasize that fetal alcohol syndrome,\\n\\nwhile, yes, there's a full-blown syndrome\\n\\nthat manifests as changes in the craniofacial development\\n\\nthat are very obvious, and you can look these up.\\n\\nYou've probably seen these before,\\n\\nthe pictures before, rather.\\n\\nIt has to do with eye spacing, forehead size,\\n\\na number of other features of the craniofacial development.\\n\\nAnd of course, stuff's going on in the brain, too.\\n\\nIt's along a continuum.\\n\\nSo it is possible that some of the changes that occur\\n\\nare more minor, and thankfully, the young brain,\\n\\nin particular the early postnatal brain,\\n\\nis incredibly plastic.\\n\\nThere are things that can be done\\n\\nin order to help recover neural circuits\\n\\nthat didn't develop well, et cetera.\\n\\nBut even though it's somewhat obvious or should be obvious,\\n\\nI really want to make clear that there's zero evidence\\n\\nwhatsoever that certain forms of alcohol\\n\\nare safer for pregnant women to ingest than others.\\n\\nAbsolutely wrong.\\n\\nNo one who's pregnant\\n\\nshould be ingesting alcohol whatsoever.\\n\\nAnd certainly, if people feel like they can't avoid alcohol\\n\\nwhile pregnant, they really need to work with somebody\\n\\nto make sure that it just absolutely doesn't happen\\n\\nbecause it is so detrimental to the developing fetus.\\n\\nLastly, I want to talk about the effects\\n\\nof alcohol on hormones, and I want to distinguish\\n\\nbetween low amounts of alcohol intake,\\n\\nhigher amounts of alcohol intake,\\n\\nand again, this chronic alcohol intake\\n\\nversus occasional use versus really chronic use,\\n\\nmeaning alcoholic or alcoholic use disorder\\n\\nwhere people are drinking an immense amount\\n\\non an ongoing basis.\\n\\nThe literature on alcohol and hormones is quite extensive,\\n\\nand there are, of course,\\n\\nmany, many different types of hormones.\\n\\nThe hormones that most often get mentioned\\n\\nand talked about on this podcast\\n\\nare the hormones testosterone and estrogen,\\n\\nwhich are present in both men and women,\\n\\nin both men and women, are important for things\\n\\nlike libido, they're also responsible\\n\\nfor sexual development, actual development\\n\\nof the genitalia before birth and after birth.\\n\\nThey're responsible, for instance,\\n\\nestrogen is important for memory and cognition.\\n\\nYou never want to drop estrogen too low in men or women\\n\\nbecause it can disrupt cognition and joint health, et cetera.\\n\\nTo keep this discussion relatively constrained,\\n\\nit's fair to say that alcohol, and in particular,\\n\\nthe toxic metabolites of alcohol,\\n\\nincrease the conversion of testosterone to estrogen.\\n\\nNow, this occurs in a number of different tissues.\\n\\nThis is not just occurring in the testes of males.\\n\\nThis is occurring in lots of different tissues,\\n\\nand I'll refer you to an excellent review.\\n\\nWe'll provide a link in the show note captions.\\n\\nThis is a paper that was published in the year 2000,\\n\\nbut the data are still quite strong.\\n\\nThe journal is called, of all things, Alcohol.\\n\\nThere's, yes, literally a journal called Alcohol\\n\\nfor the publication of data and reviews\\n\\non alcohol and its effects.\\n\\nAnd the title of the paper is,\\n\\nCan Alcohol Promote Aromatization of Androgens to Estrogens?\\n\\nAromatization is this process of the conversion\\n\\nof testosterone and other androgens to estrogens\\n\\nthrough things like aromatase enzyme.\\n\\nAnd this is a beautiful review that describes every tissue\\n\\nor near every tissue from the ovary in females\\n\\nto the placenta, to the liver, to the testes\\n\\nin which alcohol can increase the aromatization\\n\\nof testosterone to estrogen.\\n\\nNow in females, this may be part of the reason\\n\\nwhy there's an increase in estrogen-related cancers.\\n\\nBreast cancer can be either estrogen-related\\n\\nor non-estrogen-related.\\n\\nThere are other types of estrogen-related cancers\\n\\noutside of breast cancer,\\n\\nbut it appears that one reason why alcohol increases\\n\\nthe risk of breast cancer is because of this aromatization\\n\\nfrom, of testosterone, excuse me, to estrogen.\\n\\nIn males, accelerated or abnormal conversion\\n\\nof testosterone to estrogen can actually lead to growth\\n\\nof the breast tissue in males, so-called gynecomastia,\\n\\nor other effects of high estrogen,\\n\\nor I should say of altered testosterone-estrogen ratios,\\n\\nbecause that's really what's important.\\n\\nAnd these can include things like diminished sex drive,\\n\\nincreased fat storage, and a number of other things\\n\\nthat I think most people would find to be negative effects.\\n\\nI once talked about the fact that drinking alcohol\\n\\ncan increase the aromatization of testosterone to estrogen.\\n\\nI posted that online, and I didn't get attacked,\\n\\nbut I did get criticized for the fact\\n\\nthat it has been shown, yes, has been shown,\\n\\nthat small amounts of alcohol ingestion,\\n\\nso five grams or so of alcohol ingestion,\\n\\nthis would be half a glass of wine or half a glass of beer,\\n\\nat least in some studies showed increases in testosterone,\\n\\nwhich was kind of surprising, but I should point out,\\n\\nother studies have shown that alcohol ingestion\\n\\ncauses decreases in testosterone over time.\\n\\nSo there's always this issue of whether or not\\n\\nyou're looking at a study of acute exposure\\n\\nversus chronic exposure,\\n\\none dose versus multiple doses and exposure.\\n\\nI think it's fair to say, based on my read of the literature,\\n\\nthis review and other reviews\\n\\nthat focus more particularly on humans,\\n\\nthat regular ingestion of alcohol\\n\\nis going to increase estrogen levels,\\n\\nwhether or not you're male or female,\\n\\nand it's largely doing that\\n\\nthrough the aromatization process\\n\\nby increasing the aromatase enzyme.\\n\\nYes, there's some dose dependence,\\n\\nbut I think if you're somebody who's trying to optimize\\n\\nyour testosterone to estrogen ratio,\\n\\nregardless of whether or not you're male or female,\\n\\nwell, then most certainly,\\n\\nyou're going to want to avoid drinking too much alcohol.\\n\\nSo we've covered a lot of topics and data\\n\\nrelated to the mechanisms of alcohol,\\n\\nhangover, tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera.\\n\\nI acknowledge that I've mainly talked to you\\n\\nabout the negative effects of alcohol.\\n\\nI want to acknowledge that many people enjoy alcohol\\n\\nin moderation or even light drinking,\\n\\nthe occasional drink or the occasional two drinks,\\n\\nor maybe even on average, one drink per night,\\n\\nso seven drinks per week.\\n\\nI'm certainly not here to tell you\\n\\nwhat to do and what not to do.\\n\\nI do find it immensely interesting, however,\\n\\nthat first of all, alcohol is a known toxin\\n\\nto the cells of the body.\\n\\nSome of you might immediately say,\\n\\nwell, wait, what about hormesis?\\n\\nWhat about this phenomenon where\\n\\nif we regularly ingest a toxin, it makes us stronger.\\n\\nIn other words, what doesn't kill us makes us stronger.\\n\\nThere's some reason to believe that might be beneficial\\n\\nin terms of some forms of cellular resilience,\\n\\nmaybe, maybe, no, sorry.\\n\\nIt doesn't work that way.\\n\\nThere are processes of hormesis in which, for instance,\\n\\nexposing yourself safely to increases in adrenaline\\n\\nthrough ice baths or other things that increase adrenaline\\n\\ncan raise your so-called stress threshold.\\n\\nBut here we're talking about cellular stress\\n\\nand damage to cells.\\n\\nSo my read of the literature, and again, this is my read\\n\\nand I invite others to provide studies\\n\\nor I would prefer actually collections of studies\\n\\nthat point in the direction, if they exist,\\n\\nthat alcohol can be beneficial.\\n\\nBut my read of the literature, where I should say,\\n\\nmy understanding of what I would call the center of mass\\n\\nof the literature on alcohol is that no consumption,\\n\\nzero consumption, consumption of zero ounces of alcohol\\n\\nis going to be better for your health\\n\\nthan low to moderate consumption of alcohol.\\n\\nAnd that low to moderate consumption of alcohol\\n\\nis going to be better for you, of course,\\n\\nthan moderately high to high alcohol consumption\\n\\non the order of 12 to 24 or more drinks per week.\\n\\nI realize that for most people listening to this,\\n\\nit's probably low to moderate alcohol consumption\\n\\nthat is part of their standard repertoire.\\n\\nAnd I'm not here to give you justification for doing that,\\n\\nnor am I going to tell you not to do that.\\n\\nI would like you to consider perhaps, however,\\n\\nthe negative effects that we understand\\n\\nand that are documented, for instance,\\n\\nthe negative effects of alcohol and the gut microbiome\\n\\nand the things that you can do\\n\\nto better support your gut microbiome.\\n\\nThe negative effects on the stress system,\\n\\nthat HPA axis that we talked about earlier\\n\\nand the fact that even low to moderate levels\\n\\nof alcohol consumption can increase our levels of stress\\n\\nwhen we're not drinking.\\n\\nAnd to think about acquiring some tools\\n\\nand getting some proficiency with tools,\\n\\nbehavioral or otherwise,\\n\\nthat can help you with stress modulation\\n\\nthat don't involve alcohol consumption.\\n\\nAgain, the point here is to illustrate\\n\\nwhere the problems lie with alcohol consumption,\\n\\nbut also what I've tried to do is to point you\\n\\nto some resources that can help offset\\n\\nsome of those negative effects.\\n\\nWill they offset all the effects?\\n\\nI can't say that for sure,\\n\\nbut certainly taking measures to offset\\n\\nsome of the negative effects of any alcohol consumption\\n\\nthat you might be having or doing\\n\\nis going to be beneficial to you.\\n\\nAnd those tools and protocols\\n\\nare going to be health promoting in any case.\\n\\nIf you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast,\\n\\nplease subscribe to our YouTube channel.\\n\\nThat's a terrific zero-cost

       " Document(page_content=\"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\n\\nwhere we discuss science\\n\\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\\n\\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\\n\\nand I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology\\n\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\n\\nToday, we are discussing caffeine.\\n\\nCaffeine is one of the most widely used substances\\n\\non the planet.\\n\\nEstimates are that more than 90% of adults\\n\\nand as many as 50% of kids, that is adolescents and teenagers,\\n\\nuse caffeine on a daily basis.\\n\\nCaffeine is an amazing molecule.\\n\\nMost people are familiar with caffeine's ability\\n\\nto increase alertness\\n\\nand to reduce our feelings of sleepiness and fatigue.\\n\\nAnd indeed, it does that.\\n\\nBut what most people are not aware of\\n\\nis that caffeine acts as a strong reinforcer.\\n\\nWhat I mean by reinforcer\\n\\nis that when caffeine is present in a drink or food,\\n\\nand yes, indeed, caffeine is present in many foods,\\n\\neven unbeknownst to us,\\n\\nwhen it's present in drinks and foods,\\n\\nwe actively come to like those foods and drinks\\n\\nmore than if caffeine were not contained\\n\\nin those foods and drinks.\\n\\nSo it reinforces our liking of particular foods and drinks,\\n\\nand indeed, it even reinforces our liking\\n\\nof the containers they are consumed from\\n\\nand the company we keep\\n\\nwhen we consume foods and drinks that contain caffeine.\\n\\nThat is, caffeine is not just a stimulant,\\n\\ncaffeine is a reinforcer,\\n\\nand it's a reinforcer that plays an active role\\n\\nin almost everybody's daily life.\\n\\nWe can say that with confidence\\n\\nbecause, as I mentioned a moment ago,\\n\\nmore than 90% of people are consuming caffeine,\\n\\nand most people think that they consume caffeine\\n\\nbecause it makes them feel more alert.\\n\\nBut there are many reasons why you're consuming caffeine,\\n\\nand I'm not going to tell you\\n\\nthat consuming caffeine isn't necessarily bad.\\n\\nIn fact, today, I'm going to tell you\\n\\nabout many of the positive health benefits of caffeine,\\n\\nincluding neuroprotective effects,\\n\\nanti-depressive effects,\\n\\nand certainly performance-enhancing effects,\\n\\nboth for mental performance and for physical performance.\\n\\nNow, that said, there are certain situations\\n\\nin which you want to avoid caffeine,\\n\\nand there are certain people who might opt to avoid caffeine.\\n\\nThat's especially the case when one thinks about caffeine\\n\\nnot just as a stimulant, but as a reinforcer.\\n\\nIn fact, caffeine is such a strong reinforcer\\n\\nthat if even tiny amounts of caffeine are present\\n\\nin certain foods and drinks,\\n\\nyou will very quickly come to prefer those foods and drinks\\n\\nover other choices,\\n\\nwhich can be a good thing or a bad thing,\\n\\ndepending on what sorts of food and drink choices\\n\\nyou're trying to make.\\n\\nSo today, I'm going to inform you\\n\\nabout how caffeine works at a mechanistic level.\\n\\nI promise to do that with a minimum of nomenclature\\n\\nand such that even if you don't have a background\\n\\nin biology, you will be able to digest\\n\\nthat information easily.\\n\\nAnd then I'll tell you how to use caffeine to your advantage,\\n\\nor conversely, how to avoid caffeine\\n\\nat certain times to your advantage.\\n\\nSo today's episode will focus both on mechanisms and tools\\n\\nthat is the use and leverage of caffeine\\n\\nto improve mental health, physical health, and performance.\\n\\nBefore we go any further into today's discussion,\\n\\nI want to tell you about some recent results\\n\\nabout a molecule that's found in certain caffeinated\\n\\nbeverages and that has been proven to be very useful\\n\\nfor both weight loss, mental performance,\\n\\nand controlling blood sugar levels.\\n\\nAnd that's GLP-1 or glucagon-like peptide-1.\\n\\nGlucagon-like peptide-1 is found in the brain and body.\\n\\nIt acts both on the brain and body.\\n\\nIt does many different things,\\n\\nbut one of its primary effects that's been discovered\\n\\nis to reduce hunger, and it does that two ways.\\n\\nIt does that by activating certain neurons\\n\\nin your hypothalamus, so that's a brain region\\n\\nthat controls hunger and satiety.\\n\\nIt makes us feel full at the level of the brain,\\n\\nso it makes us feel sated, that is,\\n\\nand it actually makes us feel full.\\n\\nTurns out that GLP-1 acts on certain receptors in the gut\\n\\nto make us feel as if we've ingested enough food.\\n\\nIt doesn't necessarily make us feel\\n\\nas if our gut is distended, but it makes us feel full.\\n\\nThat's really interesting, because if you think about it,\\n\\nwhen we eat, our stomach fills up, obviously,\\n\\nand that information has to be communicated to the brain\\n\\nsuch that the brain can then send satiety signals\\n\\nthat actually shut off our hunger.\\n\\nAnd believe it or not, the brain actually activates signals\\n\\nto reduce the desire to chew when our stomach is full.\\n\\nAnd GLP-1, as I mentioned, works on the brain\\n\\nto create these feelings of satiety,\\n\\nas if we've had enough,\\n\\nand to reduce our desire to eat more.\\n\\nAnd GLP-1 acts directly on the gut\\n\\nto give us a slight sense of fullness in the gut,\\n\\nwhich then is communicated to the brain.\\n\\nSo really, there are two parallel signals being sent\\n\\nwhen we have GLP-1 present in our system.\\n\\nNow, a little bit of relevant history on GLP-1,\\n\\nit was actually discovered in Gila monsters.\\n\\nThese are these reptiles that can go long periods of time\\n\\nwithout eating, and a very clever scientist decided\\n\\nto study why it is that certain animals, like Gila monsters,\\n\\ncan go a long period of time without ingesting anything,\\n\\nand it's because they produce very large amounts of GLP-1.\\n\\nThey isolate the peptide from GLP-1,\\n\\nthen they looked for the analogous peptide in humans,\\n\\nand it turns out that does exist.\\n\\nAnd as I mentioned, it's released in both brain and body\\n\\nto make you feel full and sated.\\n\\nWhy am I telling you all this?\\n\\nWell, today we're going to talk about caffeine,\\n\\nand there's one particular caffeine source,\\n\\nwhich is yerba mate, and there's some other forms of teas,\\n\\nsimilar to yerba mate,\\n\\nthat stimulate the release of GLP-1 significantly.\\n\\nThere are also nowadays drugs,\\n\\nwhich are called analogs of GLP-1,\\n\\nso these are drugs that mimic or are identical\\n\\nto the kind of GLP-1 that you would make,\\n\\nand those drugs are proving to be very effective\\n\\nfor the treatment of certain forms of diabetes\\n\\nand for the treatment of obesity,\\n\\nbut they trigger enormous amounts\\n\\nof GLP-1 pathway activation.\\n\\nSo those are extreme cases for people\\n\\nthat are really struggling for weight loss,\\n\\nbut the clinical trials and the data that are out there\\n\\nin the general population now are very, very promising\\n\\nfor GLP-1 analogs.\\n\\nYerba mate tea, provided it's not the smoked variety,\\n\\nand I mention that because a number of people\\n\\nhave cued me to the fact that yerba mate teas\\n\\ncome in smoked varieties and non-smoked varieties,\\n\\nand the smoked varieties are thought\\n\\nto perhaps be carcinogenic, that is, pro-cancer causing.\\n\\nSo I advise people to avoid smoked varieties\\n\\nof yerba mate tea, but yerba mate teas are known\\n\\nto stimulate significant amounts of GLP-1 release,\\n\\nand so they can be effective as a weight loss tool,\\n\\nmainly by blunting appetite, and again, they do that\\n\\nboth at the level of the brain and at the level of the gut.\\n\\nNow, all of what I just told you has been known\\n\\nfor some period of time, but there are a new set\\n\\nof findings that were just published\\n\\nin Cell Reports Medicine, Cell Press Journal,\\n\\nexcellent journal, which indicate exactly how it is\\n\\nthat GLP-1 stimulates both satiety\\n\\nand can trigger additional weight loss\\n\\nthrough other mechanisms.\\n\\nAnd I find the mechanism to be really interesting\\n\\nand actually really important, given some other topics\\n\\nwe've covered on this podcast before.\\n\\nSo the basic finding is that GLP-1,\\n\\nwhether or not it's stimulated through the release\\n\\nof analog drug that one is prescribed,\\n\\nor by drinking yerba mate tea, for instance,\\n\\nand stimulate release of your own\\n\\nso-called endogenous GLP-1, yes, it makes you feel more full\\n\\nat the level of brain and body, but it turns out\\n\\nit also stimulates thermogenesis.\\n\\nNow, thermogenesis is the active utilization\\n\\nof more metabolic energy, and fat cells,\\n\\nin particular, so-called beige and brown fat cells,\\n\\nare a potent source of thermogenic activity in your body.\\n\\nThe basic background is that you have white adipose cells,\\n\\nso white fat cells, you have beige fat cells,\\n\\nand you have brown fat cells, and the beige and brown ones\\n\\nare fat cells that you actually want more of.\\n\\nThey are not abundant under your skin,\\n\\nthey're abundant really around your clavicles\\n\\nand your upper neck, they are the ones that generate heat,\\n\\nand the beige and brownness of them\\n\\nis actually the consequence of having\\n\\na lot of mitochondria in those cells.\\n\\nWhen GLP-1 is elevated in your system,\\n\\nit turns out that it communicates to those white fat cells\\n\\nand helps convert them into beige and brown fat cells,\\n\\nthat is, it takes fat cells that are not doing\\n\\nanything useful for you except being stored energy,\\n\\nand I think most people out there would like to have fewer\\n\\nof those white adipose cells, there are few of you out there\\n\\nthat actually need more of them that are too thin, too lean,\\n\\nbut most people are suffering from having too many\\n\\nof these white adipose cells.\\n\\nWell, when you ingest yerba mate tea\\n\\nor you were to take a GLP-1 analog\\n\\nor stimulate GLP-1 in any number of different ways,\\n\\nyes, you stimulate increased satiety,\\n\\nbut you're also stimulating the conversion\\n\\nof these white fat cells into beige and brown fat cells,\\n\\nwhich makes you more thermogenic,\\n\\nand over time, raises your basal metabolic rate,\\n\\nso you're burning more calories even at rest.\\n\\nIt also makes you feel as if you're more comfortable\\n\\nin colder environments at rest.\\n\\nThis is very much the same as the mechanism\\n\\nthat's induced when you were to, say, take a cold shower\\n\\nor do regular ice baths or get into cold water regularly,\\n\\nthat too stimulates the conversion of white fat cells\\n\\nto beige and brown fat cells.\\n\\nSo I like these findings very much\\n\\nbecause they provide a mechanistic coherence,\\n\\nthey provide, that is, a really nice story\\n\\nas to how something like GLP-1\\n\\ncould be so effective for weight loss.\\n\\nYes, on the one hand, GLP-1 is reducing appetite,\\n\\nand that, of course, will help people maintain or lose weight,\\n\\nbut it's also increasing basal metabolic rate,\\n\\nand we now know how that's accomplished.\\n\\nIt's likely accomplished,\\n\\nat least through this one mechanism,\\n\\nby the stimulation of conversion of these white fat cells,\\n\\nwhich don't do much for us except as energy storage units,\\n\\nto these metabolically mitochondrial-rich beige\\n\\nand brown fat cells,\\n\\nwhich you can think of as sort of the oil in the candle\\n\\nthat allows your furnace, your metabolism,\\n\\nto burn at a higher temperature and a higher rate.\\n\\nSo that's the mechanism, and the basic tool takeaway\\n\\nis that if you are somebody who's interested\\n\\nin losing weight and you want to leverage the GLP-1 pathway,\\n\\ndrinking a cup or two of yerba mate tea early in the day\\n\\nwould be a great way to stimulate GLP-1 release.\\n\\nThere are other ways to stimulate GLP-1 release.\\n\\nYou can get it through certain forms of exercise,\\n\\nin particular, fasted exercise.\\n\\nThis is actually a vote in favor of fasted exercise.\\n\\nThere's a debate as to whether or not fasted cardio\\n\\nburns more fat than non-fasted cardio,\\n\\nand the data basically say, no, it doesn't really matter,\\n\\nbut that doesn't really take into account\\n\\nthe longer arc of things like GLP-1 release,\\n\\nso that needs to be taken into consideration.\\n\\nSo you could do fasted cardio.\\n\\nYou could drink yerba mate tea,\\n\\nkeeping in mind that yerba mate tea does contain caffeine.\\n\\nWe'll talk more about the specific forms of stimulants,\\n\\nincluding caffeine, that mate has,\\n\\nbut mate would be a great way to stimulate GLP-1 release.\\n\\nAnd then, of course, for those of you that are interested\\n\\nin more robust activation of GLP-1,\\n\\nthen perhaps you might want to consider\\n\\nsome of the new prescription GLP-1 analogs\\n\\nthat are out there,\\n\\nbut that's a more severe stimulus for GLP-1, of course.\\n\\nAnd for everybody, regardless of whether or not\\n\\nyou're trying to lose weight, gain weight, or maintain weight,\\n\\nI think we're going to be hearing a lot more\\n\\nabout GLP-1 analogs and drinks and supplements\\n\\nand things of that sort that stimulate GLP-1\\n\\nin the very near future,\\n\\nbecause it does appear to be\\n\\na very important biological mechanism.\\n\\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\\n\\nthat this podcast is separate from my teaching\\n\\nand research roles at Stanford.\\n\\nIt is, however, part of my desire and effort\\n\\nto bring zero cost to consumer information about science\\n\\nand science-related tools to the general public.\\n\\nIn keeping with that theme,\\n\\nI'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.\\n\\nOur first sponsor is Levels.\\n\\nLevels is a program that lets you see\\n\\nhow different foods affect your health\\n\\nby giving you real-time feedback on your diet\\n\\nusing a continuous glucose monitor.\\n\\nNow, blood glucose, or blood sugar,\\n\\nis a critical aspect of your immediate and long-term health\\n\\nand, indeed, your feelings of vigor\\n\\nand mental clarity and wellbeing at any moment.\\n\\nOne of the key things is to know\\n\\nhow different foods and food combinations\\n\\nand timing of food intake is impacting blood glucose.\\n\\nAnd with Levels, you're able to assess\\n\\nall of that in real time.\\n\\nI tried Levels, and what it taught me, for instance,\\n\\nwas that I can eat certain foods at certain times of day,\\n\\nbut if I eat them at other times of day,\\n\\nI get a blood sugar crash.\\n\\nIt also taught me, for instance,\\n\\nhow to space my exercise and my food intake.\\n\\nTurns out, for me, exercising fasted\\n\\nis far more beneficial.\\n\\nThat's something I learned using Levels,\\n\\nand it's completely transformed\\n\\nnot just the spacing and timing of my diet and exercise,\\n\\nbut also use of things like the sauna and other activities.\\n\\nIt's been a tremendous learning for me\\n\\nthat's really shaped an enormous number of factors\\n\\nin my life that have led to me feeling far more vigorous\\n\\nwith far

deeply asleep throughout the night,\\n\\nour body temperature needs to drop\\n\\nby about one to three degrees.\\n\\nAnd conversely, when we wake up in the morning,\\n\\nthat is in large part because of our body\\n\\nheating up by one to three degrees.\\n\\nNow, people have different core body temperatures,\\n\\nand they tend to run colder or hotter throughout the night.\\n\\n8 Sleep allows you to

mention that the library\\n\\nof those supplements is constantly expanding.\\n\\nAgain, that's livemomentus.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nLet's talk about caffeine.\\n\\nSo as I mentioned earlier,\\n\\ncaffeine is consumed by basically most all adults\\n\\nevery single day and consumed at very regular times each day.\\n\\nIn fact, if you were to take a look at your caffeine intake\\n\\nor the caffeine intake of somebody close to you,\\n\\nwhat you would realize is that they don't do so well\\n\\nif their caffeine intake arrives even 10, 20\\n\\nor 30 minutes past their expected\\n\\nor usual intake of caffeine.\\n\\nThat's pretty remarkable.\\n\\nAnd it brings to mind ideas that we are all\\n\\nquote unquote addicted to caffeine\\n\\nor that caffeine is somehow bad.\\n\\nI'm certainly not going to make the argument\\n\\nthat caffeine is bad.\\n\\nFirst of all, I'm a regular caffeine user.\\n\\nI wouldn't call myself a caffeine abuser,\\n\\nbut I am a regular caffeine user.\\n\\nAnd caffeine is known to have certain health benefits.\\n\\nI listed off a few of them earlier,\\n\\nbut I'll mention those again now before going forward.\\n\\nCaffeine is known to have certain neuroprotective effects.\\n\\nAnd that is because of its ability\\n\\nto increase neuromodulators such as dopamine,\\n\\nbut also other so-called catecholamines\\n\\nlike norepinephrine.\\n\\nIf you don't know what those names mean,\\n\\nthese are molecules that increase levels of alertness,\\n\\nmotivation and drive.\\n\\nAnd so then therefore not surprisingly,\\n\\nthe large scale analysis of the relationship\\n\\nbetween depression and caffeine\\n\\nshows that provided people are not drinking so much caffeine\\n\\nthat it makes them overly anxious,\\n\\nthat regular intake of caffeine\\n\\nis inversely related to levels of depression.\\n\\nSo it may have some antidepressant effects\\n\\nand those could be direct or indirect.\\n\\nWhat do I mean by that?\\n\\nWell, you could imagine that if people are ingesting caffeine\\n\\nand they are more motivated to do work\\n\\nand pursue quality social interactions,\\n\\nthen the probability that they will have depression\\n\\ncould be lower.\\n\\nIt could also be that there are direct effects\\n\\non the chemical systems of the brain\\n\\nthat relate to mood and wellbeing\\n\\nthat could offset depression.\\n\\nIt is not clear whether or not the effects\\n\\nof caffeine encountering depression\\n\\nare direct or indirect.\\n\\nNonetheless, there's a relationship there\\n\\nand it's an interesting and positive one.\\n\\nOr I should say negative correlation,\\n\\npositive effect overall on mood and wellbeing to be exact.\\n\\nNow it's also the case that caffeine can improve\\n\\nmental performance and physical performance.\\n\\nThis has been demonstrated in tens of thousands of studies.\\n\\nI will review a few studies on this in particular today,\\n\\nbut to just give you a sense of how caffeine works\\n\\nat the level of its timing and impact\\n\\non mental performance and physical performance.\\n\\nWhen we ingest caffeine,\\n\\nprovided that we don't have a lot of food in our stomach\\n\\nand that our blood sugar isn't particularly high,\\n\\ngenerally we experience an increase in alertness\\n\\nwithin about five minutes.\\n\\nAnd that increase in focus and alertness peaks\\n\\naround 30 minutes after ingestion of caffeine\\n\\nand persists for as long as 60 minutes.\\n\\nNow this is assuming that one takes caffeine in pill form\\n\\nor drinks the entire caffeine drink\\n\\nwithin a short period of time.\\n\\nBut a little bit later,\\n\\nI'll talk about how you can consume caffeine\\n\\nat regular intervals while doing mental work\\n\\nor physical work in a way that can further increase\\n\\nmental performance and physical performance.\\n\\nBut let's just touch on what caffeine intake\\n\\nreally does for mental performance and physical performance.\\n\\nPerhaps the most robust finding across all of the studies\\n\\nthat I've examined is that caffeine reduces\\n\\nour reaction time, that is it improves our reaction time.\\n\\nIt doesn't make it longer, it makes it shorter.\\n\\nSo for instance, in a laboratory study\\n\\nwhere people were asked to hit a lever\\n\\nevery time they hear a tone,\\n\\nyou can greatly reduce the time between the tone\\n\\nand the pressing of the lever\\n\\nif people ingest caffeine about 30 minutes\\n\\nbefore they do that task.\\n\\nNow that seems like a trivial task,\\n\\nbut this is also seen in the domain of sports performance\\n\\nand even in cognitive performance\\n\\nwhere people have to arrive at a particular answer\\n\\nto a question and the answer to that question\\n\\nhas to be pulled from their memory banks within their brain,\\n\\ntheir hippocampus, for instance,\\n\\na brain structure involved in memory.\\n\\nAnd if you are asking people, for instance,\\n\\nto remember the capitals of different states or cities\\n\\nor to remember certain historical facts,\\n\\nthey will do that at a particular rate.\\n\\nBut if they've ingested caffeine within the hour prior,\\n\\ntheir ability to recall that information\\n\\nis much, much better.\\n\\nThey are faster and it does not appear\\n\\nthat accuracy is reduced.\\n\\nIn fact, in many cases, accuracy is enhanced.\\n\\nAnd that's because caffeine both works\\n\\non the reaction time systems of the brain and body.\\n\\nI'll talk about the mechanisms for that in a little bit,\\n\\nbut it also stimulates certain neurotransmitters\\n\\nand so-called neuromodulators within the brain and body\\n\\nthat give the neural circuits in the brain\\n\\nthat are associated with learning and memory\\n\\na lower threshold to activation.\\n\\nWhat does that mean?\\n\\nThat means that we are better able to access\\n\\nthe brain circuitry involved in learning and memory\\n\\nwhen we have a certain amount of caffeine\\n\\ncirculating in our system.\\n\\nSo this makes caffeine an incredible\\n\\nperformance enhancing compound.\\n\\nAnd I could give you tens of thousands\\n\\nof examples of this in humans.\\n\\nBut before I do that, I want to just touch on\\n\\nwhat we know about the existence of caffeine in nature\\n\\nand what the existence of caffeine in nature\\n\\nand its effects on other animals\\n\\ntells us about what caffeine does in humans.\\n\\nBecause as I alluded to earlier,\\n\\nwhat caffeine is doing for us is not just\\n\\nmaking us more alert, improving our memory,\\n\\nimproving our reaction time and so on.\\n\\nIt's actually acting as a powerful reinforcer of experience.\\n\\nAnd it's acting as not just a powerful reinforcer\\n\\nof the caffeine containing drink that we drink,\\n\\nbut also the mug that it's contained in,\\n\\nplus the person that we might be sitting across from\\n\\nwhen we consume that caffeine and so on.\\n\\nIf it's a little bit hard for you to conceptualize\\n\\nwhat a reinforcer is and why I'm calling it a reinforcer,\\n\\nlet me spell it out in three specific ways.\\n\\nWe often hear about the word reward.\\n\\nAnd we think, okay, if we do certain things\\n\\nand we like the outcome,\\n\\nthen those certain things are rewarded, right?\\n\\nIf we're doing something, we receive praise,\\n\\nthe praise is the reward.\\n\\nAnd therefore we are more likely\\n\\nto do that thing in the future.\\n\\nIn fact, a lot of parenting is like that.\\n\\nAnd a lot of life is like that.\\n\\nHowever, when we hear the word reward,\\n\\nwe often think about something that feels good to us.\\n\\nAnd certainly if we've worked hard and we get some praise,\\n\\nthat's natural for the praise to feel good to us.\\n\\nOr for instance, if we work very hard\\n\\nand we get a certain outcome, a trophy, a financial outcome,\\n\\na degree outcome, recognition, et cetera,\\n\\nall of those can act as rewards,\\n\\nbut those are all conscious rewards.\\n\\nWe are aware that they are happening.\\n\\nReinforcers are a little bit different\\n\\nbecause the word reinforcement can apply\\n\\nto conscious rewards of the sort that I just described.\\n\\nBut there are also many ways in which caffeine stimulates\\n\\nthe release of chemicals in our body that act as reinforcers.\\n\\nBut those reinforcers are subconscious.\\n\\nThat is, we are not aware that they cause this preference\\n\\nfor the activities that cause their release.\\n\\nSo the study I'm about to describe beautifully,\\n\\nI believe, encapsulates how is it that humans came\\n\\nto consume caffeine and why caffeine exists in nature\\n\\nand the powerful effects of caffeine as a reinforcing agent,\\n\\nboth in animals, insects, and in you and me.\\n\\nAnd the title of the paper is Caffeine and Floral Nectar\\n\\nEnhances a Pollinator's Memory of Reward.\\n\\nKeep in mind that caffeine is made from plants.\\n\\nSome of you will say, duh,\\n\\nbut I think some of us don't realize\\n\\nthat the reason why there is caffeine in coffee\\n\\nis because coffee comes from a plant.\\n\\nIt's a coffee bean.\\n\\nCertain teas, which of course are plants that people brew,\\n\\ncaffeine is contained in those teas, such as yerba mate.\\n\\nWell, why would this bitter substance,\\n\\nbecause in fact, caffeine is quite bitter\\n\\nin high concentrations, why would this bitter substance\\n\\nbe something that insects or animals\\n\\nwould want to consume at all?\\n\\nIt turns out that in most plants,\\n\\ncaffeine is present in small enough quantities\\n\\nthat insects and other animals,\\n\\nand in fact, we can't actually taste the caffeine.\\n\\nIf I were to give you a little bit of pure caffeine,\\n\\nyes, it would be a stimulant for you,\\n\\nbut you would say that it tasted awful.\\n\\nIt's in a category of compounds\\n\\nthat would strongly stimulate the bitter receptors\\n\\non your tongue and would make you cringe and pucker\\n\\nand essentially walk away from whatever it is\\n\\nthat contained that caffeine\\n\\nand from the experience that contained that caffeine.\\n\\nWell, in nature, caffeine is present\\n\\nin very low concentrations or is masked by other flavors\\n\\nwithin flowers, beans, and plants.\\n\\nAnd what this paper really points to\\n\\nis that caffeine in nature is acting as a reinforcer\\n\\nfor bees that are consuming different nectar.\\n\\nSo the way that it works is that bees, of course,\\n\\ngo from flower to flower and they are consuming the nectar.\\n\\nThey are bringing nectar and pollen back to the hive,\\n\\nand that provides critical nourishment for the bee colony.\\n\\nThe bees are foraging in a way\\n\\nthat includes information about color,\\n\\nin particular, ultraviolet color,\\n\\nthings that we can't see, but they can see\\n\\nbecause they have different photoreceptors than we do.\\n\\nAnd what this study shows is that plants and nectars\\n\\nthat contain very small amounts of caffeine\\n\\nare the preferred sources of food for bees.\\n\\nAnd the study is beautiful\\n\\nbecause they were able to confirm\\n\\nthat they could mask the caffeine taste\\n\\nso that they know that the bees\\n\\nare not preferring the taste of caffeine.\\n\\nBut what they do is they pair caffeine\\n\\nwith different food sources for the bees,\\n\\nthen they remove the caffeine.\\n\\nAnd what they find is that the bees very strongly\\n\\nprefer flavors that contain caffeine,\\n\\nnot because they could taste the caffeine,\\n\\nbut rather for the way that those caffeine-containing\\n\\nflavors made the bees feel.\\n\\nSo how do those caffeine-containing flavors\\n\\nmake the bees feel?\\n\\nThe same way that they make you and I feel,\\n\\na little bit more alert and thereby able to do more work.\\n\\nFor the bee, the more work is the consumption of more food,\\n\\nwhich then has a further reinforcing effect.\\n\\nSo what we're really talking about here is the fact that,\\n\\nA, caffeine exists in nature, in plants.\\n\\nIt exists in concentrations that are very low,\\n\\nso low, in fact, that they are not detectable\\n\\nto the taste receptors of insects,\\n\\nand in many cases to the taste receptors of humans.\\n\\nAnd of course, there can be high levels of caffeine\\n\\nin a plant, but if the plant also contains compounds\\n\\nthat mask the flavor of caffeine,\\n\\nwell, then those plants are going to essentially\\n\\nbe even stronger reinforcers for the flavor of the plant.\\n\\nOkay, so now we're talking about strong flavors\\n\\nplus strong neurostimulant effects of caffeine.\\n\\nAnd the most important point here is that\\n\\nall of these effects of caffeine are subconscious.\\n\\nIt is not because the bee or you likes the taste of caffeine.\\n\\nIn fact, most people, when they take their first sip\\n\\nof coffee, they find that it tastes bitter\\n\\nand kind of noxious, they don't like it.\\n\\nYou may not even remember that\\n\\nbecause it happened so long ago,\\n\\nand because caffeine is such a strong reinforcer\\n\\nthat very quickly you come to like the taste of coffee.\\n\\nYou might even come to like the feeling\\n\\nof your mug in your hand.\\n\\nYou might even come to like the smell of coffee\\n\\nand so on and so forth.\\n\\nAnd that's because caffeine stimulates the release\\n\\nof certain neurochemicals in the brain,\\n\\nin particular, dopamine and acetylcholine,\\n\\ntwo neuromodulators that increase our focus and alertness\\n\\nand our feelings of wellbeing.\\n\\nA little bit later, I'll tell you that\\n\\ncaffeine stimulates the release of dopamine\\n\\nin a way that's very much distinct\\n\\nfrom the classical dopamine pathway\\n\\nassociated with addiction and reward.\\n\\nIn fact, we can think of caffeine\\n\\nas having a somewhat privileged access to the reward systems.\\n\\nI'll give you a bit of a hint of where this is going.\\n\\nCaffeine stimulates the release of dopamine\\n\\nand acetylcholine not within the classic\\n\\nso-called mesolimbic reward pathway.\\n\\nThat's just fancy nerd speak\\n\\nfor the reward pathways of the brain\\n\\nthat are associated with things like sex and food\\n\\nand drugs of abuse like cocaine and methamphetamine,\\n\\nbut rather caffeine seems to stimulate\\n\\nthe release of dopamine in the parts of the brain\\n\\nthat are associated with alertness and cognition,\\n\\nmeaning the forebrain.\\n\\nThis is very important.\\n\\nWe have multiple dopamine systems in the brain and body,\\n\\nand caffeine seems to stimulate dopamine\\n\\ndirectly within the components of the brain\\n\\nthat are associated with clarity of thought and wellbeing,\\n\\nbut more so clarity of thought.\\n\\nNow, I'm also talking about caffeine as a strong reinforcer\\n\\nin that it makes you feel good overall, and it does,\\n\\nand that suggests that it also taps\\n\\ninto the more classic reward pathway,\\n\\nbut it does that in a very interesting\\n\\nand frankly almost diabolical way.\\n\\nWhen we regularly ingest caffeine,\\n\\nit stimulates the increase in dopamine receptors\\n\\nat multiple sites throughout the brain,\\n\\nbut in particular within the reward pathways of the brain.\\n\\nSo not the areas of the brain that are associated\\n\\nwith focus and clarity of thought and cognition.\\n\\nIt does that, but it is also increasing the level\\n\\nof dopamine receptors in the reward pathway.\\n\\nAnd what that means is that for any dopamine\\n\\nthat's released in response to a positive experience,\\n\\nsocial experience, or any number of the other things\\n\\nthat can stimulate dopamine release,\\n\\nthere are more receptors, more parking spots, if you will,\\n\\nfor that dopamine to arrive at and to exert\\n\\nits increases in mood, increases in motivation,\\n\\nand overall feelings of drive and excitement.\\n\\nSo there are four ways that caffeine works\\n\\nthat we need to understand.\\n\\nFirst of all, caffeine acts as a reinforcing agent.\\n\\nIt increases the probability that you will return to\\n\\nand engage in a certain activity\\n\\nor consume a certain beverage or food.\\n\\nSecond of all, caffeine increases dopamine and acetylcholine,\\n\\nwhich are both neuromodulators in the forebrain,\\n\\nwhich helps us improve our ability to think,\\n\\nto modify our rule sets, that is to adjust our strategies\\n\\nfor different social situations and mental demands\\n\\nand physical demands.\\n\\nAnd third, it increases the number and efficacy\\n\\nof dopamine receptors in the reward pathways of the brain.\\n\\nThat is, it makes things that would feel pretty good,\\n\\nfeel even better.\\n\\nAnd fourth, caffeine acts as an antagonist to adenosine,\\n\\nwhich offsets the sleepiness that we would otherwise feel\\n\\nfrom the accumulation of adenosine that occurs\\n\\nas we are awake for more and more hours throughout the day.\\n\\nSo let's talk first about caffeine as a reinforcing agent.\\n\\nAgain, this was first most beautifully demonstrated\\n\\nin this study on honeybees,\\n\\nwhere the bees prefer nectars that contain caffeine,\\n\\nand that all makes perfect sense\\n\\nin terms of the ecology of bees and flowers\\n\\nthat contain nectar.\\n\\nThere's an advantage, at least in terms of adaptation,\\n\\nthat the flower benefits because of distribution\\n\\nof things from the flower, which is good for the flowers,\\n\\nand the bees benefit because they're getting food.\\n\\nAnd so there's a kind of a symbiosis there.\\n\\nBut with humans, we're consuming caffeine-containing\\n\\nbeverages for our sake.\\n\\nI don't think we have it in mind,\\n\\nnor do the bees have it in mind, frankly,\\n\\nthat we're trying to preserve the plants\\n\\nthat provide the caffeine.\\n\\nI think we would all suffer,\\n\\nor I should say 90% of adults would suffer greatly\\n\\nif all the caffeine-containing coffee and tea plants\\n\\nwere gone, certainly.\\n\\nBut most of us are not consuming coffees and teas\\n\\nand caffeine-containing foods\\n\\nbecause we're thinking about the plants they come from\\n\\nand we want to help those plants.\\n\\nWe're thinking about how we want to help ourselves.\\n\\nAnd yet the point of the reinforcing effects of caffeine\\n\\nare that they are largely subconscious.\\n\\nWe are not aware of them.\\n\\nNow you might say, no, that's not true.\\n\\nWhen I drink caffeine, it makes me feel really good.\\n\\nSo I'm aware that it makes me feel good.\\n\\nIn order to illustrate how reinforcement really works,\\n\\nlet me give you the counter example,\\n\\nwhich would be an aversive agent.\\n\\nSo we have reinforcing agents and we have aversive agents.\\n\\nLet's say that there were compounds in nature\\n\\nthat exist in plants that are aversive.\\n\\nAnd indeed they are.\\n\\nAnd let's say that these compounds were present\\n\\nat such low concentrations that you couldn't taste them.\\n\\nLet's say you wake up in the morning\\n\\nand you go to your refrigerator and you open it up\\n\\nand you are thirsty.\\n\\nAnd so you reach for a nice, you know,\\n\\nrich red-containing beverage in a glass jar.\\n\\nMaybe it looks like cranberry juice\\n\\nor something of that sort,\\n\\nor even a nice clear glass of water.\\n\\nIt looks like a jug of water, a glass of water,\\n\\nand you drink that.\\n\\nTastes fine to you, maybe even tastes great to you.\\n\\nAnd then let's say about 30 minutes later,\\n\\nyou feel a little queasy, you feel a little off.\\n\\nYou feel like going back to sleep.\\n\\nYou just don't feel very good.\\n\\nYou don't know why,\\n\\nbut your nervous system is a predictive machine\\n\\nand it has a process in which it back integrates,\\n\\nor I should say integrates backwards\\n\\ninto your immediate experience\\n\\nthat preceded that not so good feeling.\\n\\nWe can reliably say that there is a much lower probability\\n\\nthat the next day when you wake up,\\n\\nthat you would reach for that same beverage\\n\\nor for that same container even.\\n\\nAnd maybe if you're in a novel environment,\\n\\nmaybe you're staying in an Airbnb or a hotel\\n\\nor something of that sort,\\n\\nyou might even find that you don't really like the kitchen\\n\\nin which you consume that beverage in the first place.\\n\\nAnd then you don't know why.\\n\\nAnd unless you got very, very sick the day before,\\n\\nit's unlikely that you would have such a strong response\\n\\nthat you would entirely avoid, for instance,\\n\\nwater or glass jars containing liquids, et cetera.\\n\\nLet's say you went back to the refrigerator\\n\\nand you consume beverage again\\n\\nand you just didn't feel so well.\\n\\nYou felt less good than you normally would.\\n\\nWell, even without any ability to taste\\n\\nwhat's in that beverage,\\n\\nand even without any understanding\\n\\nof what was happening to you at a conscious level,\\n\\nthere is a very, very high probability\\n\\nthat you will avoid drinking that particular beverage,\\n\\nand certainly at that location\\n\\nand in the same volume in the subsequent days.\\n\\nThat's just the way that aversive agents work.\\n\\nAnd they work by way of activating neurons in the gut\\n\\nthat communicate with areas in the brain\\n\\nthat give us this feeling of queasiness.\\n\\nAnd for some of you hearing this,\\n\\nthat pathway and that association\\n\\nwith times in which you felt queasy\\n\\nand as if you wanted to vomit is so powerful\\n\\nthat you might even be feeling\\n\\nsome of that symptomology now.\\n\\nFor certain people, that's going to be increased salivation\\n\\nwhich precedes vomiting.\\n\\nWe know that there's a class of neurons in the brain\\n\\nrelated to an area called area post tremor\\n\\nthat actually stimulates vomiting.\\n\\nAnd if I keep talking about this,\\n\\nI'll probably feel like I want to vomit.\\n\\nSo I'm going to move on from this in a moment.\\n\\nSo when we ingest caffeine containing beverages and foods,\\n\\nit's the exact opposite scenarios to what I just described.\\n\\nCaffeine as a reinforcer makes us feel slightly better\\n\\nor a lot better in the immediate minutes\\n\\nand hours after we ingest it.\\n\\nSo it's acting as a reinforcing agent,\\n\\nnot just while you're under the effects of caffeine,\\n\\nbut for the things that preceded the ingestion of caffeine\\n\\nwhich is why you return again and again\\n\\nto caffeine containing beverages such as coffee and tea\\n\\nor maybe even foods that contain caffeine,\\n\\neven if the taste of those foods is not something\\n\\nthat you would otherwise consider especially delicious.\\n\\nIn fact, most people when they take their first sip of coffee\\n\\nor tea or other caffeine containing beverage,\\n\\nthey find it to be very bitter\\n\\nand that's not because of the taste of caffeine,\\n\\nit's because of the taste of the beverage itself\\n\\nindependent of caffeine.\\n\\nHowever, when caffeine is present in there,\\n\\nthey come to prefer that taste over most all tastes.\\n\\nIn fact, they will, as I mentioned earlier,\\n\\nwill invest a lot of financial resources\\n\\nand time and energy to make sure that they get that beverage.\\n\\nWhat they're trying to make sure\\n\\nis not that they get that taste,\\n\\nbut that they get the caffeine.\\n\\nIt is that positively reinforcing\\n\\nand the taste therefore takes on new significance,\\n\\nnew meaning and we come to associate it as positive\\n\\nand in fact, most of us, including myself,\\n\\nlove the taste of espresso, love the taste of coffee,\\n\\nlove the taste of yerba mate,\\n\\neven if the initial taste,\\n\\nthe very first time that we consume that beverage\\n\\nwas either neutral or negative\\n\\nand that is all because of the reinforcing properties\\n\\nof caffeine.\\n\\nAnd then of course,\\n\\nthere are the more direct actions of caffeine,\\n\\nthat is the faster actions of caffeine\\n\\nand just to list those off again very briefly\\n\\nso that you have them in mind going forward,\\n\\ncaffeine also increases the release of dopamine\\n\\nand acetylcholine,\\n\\nboth of which are neuromodulators in the forebrain,\\n\\nwhich increases clarity of thought\\n\\nand your ability to rule switch,\\n\\nyour ability to move from one context to another\\n\\nand change and understand the rules of engagement,\\n\\nsocial engagement, physical engagement,\\n\\nmental engagement and so forth.\\n\\nAnd as I mentioned before,\\n\\ncaffeine also increases the number of dopamine receptors\\n\\nin the reward pathway,\\n\\nsuch that any good thing that happens to you,\\n\\nany positive experience that you have\\n\\nwill have a more potent effect\\n\\non your feelings of wellbeing.\\n\\nAnd last but certainly not least,\\n\\ncaffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist.\\n\\nIt reduces your feelings of lethargy and fatigue\\n\\nand your desire to sleep\\n\\nby parking in the receptors for adenosine\\n\\nand not allowing adenosine to have its pro-sleepy,\\n\\nif you will, effects on your brain and body.\\n\\nI'd like to take a quick break\\n\\nand acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.\\n\\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1,\\n\\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\\n\\nthat covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.\\n\\nI've been taking Athletic Greens

really easy to mix up Athletic Greens\\n\\nwhile you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.\\n\\nAnd they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.\\n\\nAgain, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman\\n\\nto get the five free travel packs\\n\\nand the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.\\n\\nI'd like to just briefly talk about adenosine\\n\\nand some of its molecular features.\\n\\nAnd again, if you don't have a background in biology,\\n\\ndon't worry, I promise to make this very clear to everyone.\\n\\nFirst of all, caffeine is what's called a methylxanthine.\\n\\nIt's a plant alkaloid.\\n\\nThat's why caffeine itself is very bitter.\\n\\nAgain, if I were to give you just the tiniest little bit\\n\\nof pure caffeine, you would find it to be extremely aversive.\\n\\nAnd so these plants that have snuck small enough amounts\\n\\nof caffeine into them or that have masked the flavor\\n\\nof caffeine with other flavors such that bees\\n\\nand humans want to consume them,\\n\\nwhile we don't know what plants think,\\n\\nit does seem very diabolical and very clever\\n\\nin that we are seeking out these caffeine-containing plants,\\n\\nbeverages, and foods, even though caffeine itself\\n\\nis this alkaloid is very, very bitter.\\n\\nMethylxanthine, that is caffeine,\\n\\nbinds to adenosine receptors.\\n\\nAnd there are really two types of adenosine receptors.\\n\\nThere are these so-called A1 receptors\\n\\nand the A2 receptors.\\n\\nAnd they're present in different parts of the brain\\n\\nand body at different levels.\\n\\nWe don't have to get too far into receptor subtypes.\\n\\nMore importantly to understand is that adenosine\\n\\nmakes us feel tired because of the way\\n\\nthat it taps into the ATP pathway.\\n\\nThe ATP pathway is central to energy production\\n\\nand feelings of overall energy in our brain and body\\n\\nin all cells and organ systems.\\n\\nWhen caffeine binds to adenosine receptors,\\n\\nit prevents adenosine from breaking down certain components\\n\\nof the energy production pathway.\\n\\nAnd the net consequence of that is increased cyclic AMP.\\n\\nSo basically, when we ingest caffeine,\\n\\nwe are biasing our system towards the pro-energetic aspects\\n\\nof these cellular pathways.\\n\\nNow, it's really important to understand that in biology,\\n\\neven if you block a receptor\\n\\nor you prevent the activity of an enzyme,\\n\\nand at least in this case,\\n\\nyou end up with more cyclic AMP, more energy,\\n\\nyou're not really getting more energy.\\n\\nYou're actually borrowing energy against an overall system\\n\\nthat is frankly non-negotiable.\\n\\nWhat do I mean by that?\\n\\nWell, let's say that you were to wake up\\n\\nafter six or eight hours of sleep\\n\\nand to drink a lot of caffeine\\n\\nand keep drinking caffeine throughout the day,\\n\\nthroughout the day, blocking those adenosine receptors.\\n\\nYes, you'll offset fatigue.\\n\\nYou'll offset sleepiness\\n\\nbecause that adenosine simply can't function.\\n\\nBut at the point where the caffeine becomes dislodged\\n\\nfrom the adenosine receptors,\\n\\nyou will have a massive glut, a backlog of adenosine,\\n\\nand you will feel extra, extra sleepy.\\n\\nSo really, there's no way\\n\\nto create more energy in your system.\\n\\nReally what you're doing is you're changing the timing\\n\\nin which the sleepy signals\\n\\nand the more energetic signals are arriving.\\n\\nAnd this is really important to understand\\n\\nas the backdrop to the various tools\\n\\nthat we're going to get into next,\\n\\nin which you can use caffeine\\n\\nfor enhancing mental performance and physical performance\\n\\nand other aspects of health.\\n\\nBut it's very important to understand this concept\\n\\nthat when you wake up in the morning,\\n\\nprovided that you slept well enough the night before,\\n\\nyour levels of adenosine will be about as low\\n\\nas they will ever be.\\n\\nActually, in order to get your adenosine levels\\n\\nreally bottomed out,\\n\\nyou want to avoid caffeine\\n\\nin the first 90 to 120 minutes after waking.\\n\\nWe'll talk about why that is\\n\\nbecause it turns out there's a way\\n\\nto completely clear adenosine out of your system\\n\\nin the hour or so after waking.\\n\\nBut for most people, adenosine levels are going to be close\\n\\nto their lowest after a good night's sleep.\\n\\nBut there's really no negotiating the accumulation\\n\\nof adenosine that's going to occur\\n\\nand going to bias you towards feeling more sleepy\\n\\nthan you would otherwise\\n\\nthat's going to occur throughout the day.\\n\\nThere's really no way to eliminate adenosine.\\n\\nAll you can really do is block its function.\\n\\nSo it's sort of like borrowing energy\\n\\nagainst the fatigue that you will inevitably feel.\\n\\nNow, this actually has very important\\n\\nsocio-economical relevance.\\n\\nBefore caffeine was regularly consumed by human beings,\\n\\nwe were really slaves to the light-dark cycle.\\n\\nAnd this was especially true\\n\\nbefore the presence of artificial lighting.\\n\\nBut even before the advent of artificial lighting,\\n\\nhumans were largely constrained\\n\\nto the outside light-dark cycle.\\n\\nWe need to be active during the day\\n\\nand working during the day,\\n\\nand we need to be asleep at night.\\n\\nCaffeine allows us to divorce ourselves\\n\\nfrom that circadian cycle.\\n\\nCircadian just means about 24-hour.\\n\\nCaffeine allows us to do that at least somewhat\\n\\nby way of increasing our alertness,\\n\\nthat is spiking our alertness\\n\\nat various times throughout the day and even at night.\\n\\nThis is how we can have shift workers, for instance,\\n\\nthat can sleep during the day\\n\\nand then drink a strong cup of coffee at 8 p.m.\\n\\nand then work into the night.\\n\\nThat ability completely transformed our society.\\n\\nNow, of course, the healthiest schedule,\\n\\nwe know this with certainty,\\n\\nthe healthiest schedule for brain and body\\n\\nis going to be alert during the daytime\\n\\nand asleep at night.\\n\\nThere's no question about that.\\n\\nShift workers run into all sorts of health problems.\\n\\nAnd thank you, shift workers,\\n\\nfor doing the important work that you do.\\n\\nWe need you, air traffic controllers,\\n\\nparamedics, firefighters, police officers, et cetera.\\n\\nBut we know that there are serious health consequences,\\n\\nnegative health consequences, that is, for shift workers.\\n\\nBut for most people out there,\\n\\nabout 95% of people follow a typical schedule\\n\\nwhere they're awake during the day and asleep at night.\\n\\nAnd yet it used to be before the advent\\n\\nof caffeine-containing beverages,\\n\\nthat if you were sleepy in the afternoon,\\n\\nyou either had to take a nap or battle that sleepiness.\\n\\nThat your activity rhythms and your sleep rhythms\\n\\nwere governed by these circadian changes\\n\\nin availability of sunlight and when you slept.\\n\\nAnd you just didn't have the ability to ingest a beverage\\n\\nthat would increase your levels of alertness\\n\\nbecause you block adenosine.\\n\\nSo this is important to understand that nowadays,\\n\\nwe certainly live in a time in which we use,\\n\\nin fact, 90% or more of adults\\n\\nand half or more of adolescents and teenagers\\n\\nuse caffeine as a way to negotiate with,\\n\\nto borrow against this natural pattern\\n\\nof adenosine making us sleepy.\\n\\nBut again, you're just offsetting the effects\\n\\nof sleepiness that adenosine causes.\\n\\nYou can't eliminate the adenosine entirely.\\n\\nThe important point is that adenosine\\n\\nas a pro-sleepy molecule is a non-negotiable aspect\\n\\nof your biology.\\n\\nIn fact, it's so non-negotiable that every 24 hours,\\n\\nyou are going to release adenosine\\n\\nand you're going to release adenosine\\n\\nin direct proportion to how long you've been awake.\\n\\nSo the longer you've been awake,\\n\\nthe more adenosine circulating in your system.\\n\\nThere are really only a handful of ways\\n\\nto completely clear out adenosine.\\n\\nThe major one being to get sleep.\\n\\nThe other is to take a short nap, which of course is sleep,\\n\\nbut it's shallow sleep or non-sleep deep rest.\\n\\nSo-called NSDR has been shown\\n\\nto reduce levels of adenosine.\\n\\nAnd there are certain things such as\\n\\nviewing morning sunlight,\\n\\nwhich because of its effects on cortisol\\n\\ncan quote unquote clear out adenosine.\\n\\nWe'll talk about this in more detail in a few minutes.\\n\\nAnd there's also evidence that certain forms of exercise\\n\\nprovided that it's brief and intense\\n\\ncan also reduce adenosine, not just block its effects.\\n\\nNow that we've talked about some of the incredible mechanisms\\n\\nby which caffeine changes our experience of life,\\n\\nincreases alertness and mood, et cetera,\\n\\nI want to talk about the use of caffeine as a tool.\\n\\nNow caffeine is a very potent and useful tool\\n\\nfor enhancing mental health, physical health,\\n\\nand performance.\\n\\nBut there are certain considerations\\n\\none has to keep in mind, in particular dose.\\n\\nNow, first off, not everybody will respond\\n\\nto the same dose of caffeine the same way,\\n\\nbut we can reliably say that your body weight\\n\\nis a good measure by which you can estimate\\n\\nwhat a healthy, useful dose of caffeine would be.\\n\\nSo for most people, ingesting one to three milligrams\\n\\nof caffeine per kilogram of body weight\\n\\nis going to be the range in which\\n\\ncaffeine can have positive effects\\n\\nwithout making us feel overly anxious\\n\\nand give us that feeling that we're jumping out of our skin\\n\\nand turn the otherwise positive experience of caffeine\\n\\ninto an aversive one.\\n\\nFor those of you that aren't familiar with thinking\\n\\nin terms of kilograms and normally thinking pounds,\\n\\nI'll just quickly give you some general estimations\\n\\nthat, for instance, 100 kilograms equals 220 pounds.\\n\\nSo for me, I weigh 100 kilograms.\\n\\nThat means that one to three milligrams,\\n\\nagain, milligrams, thousandths of a gram,\\n\\none to three milligrams of caffeine\\n\\nper kilogram of body weight would mean for me,\\n\\nI could safely ingest 100 to 300 milligrams of caffeine\\n\\nin a single dose, in a single drink,\\n\\nif that's the way I'm consuming it,\\n\\nor pill form, if that's the way that I'm consuming it.\\n\\nAnd it's very likely that that will be a tolerable dose.\\n\\nHowever, if you are not somebody that's accustomed\\n\\nto drinking caffeine on a regular basis,\\n\\nI suggest you start on the lower end\\n\\nof that one to three milligrams per kilogram\\n\\nof body weight range.\\n\\nSo for instance, if you're somebody who weighs 50 kilograms,\\n\\nthat's approximately 110 pounds,\\n\\nand you would be pretty comfortable ingesting somewhere\\n\\nbetween 50 and 150 milligrams of caffeine.\\n\\nSo what I recommend is that people\\n\\nwho are considering using caffeine as a tool,\\n\\nor who are already ingesting caffeine,\\n\\nstart to think about the dosage of caffeine\\n\\nthat you are ingesting or plan to ingest,\\n\\nand the timing in which you ingest that caffeine\\n\\nrelative to certain tasks throughout your day,\\n\\nyour waking and your sleep.\\n\\nAnd we'll talk about that in just a moment.\\n\\nBut the first step for you is to figure out\\n\\nhow much you weigh in kilograms,\\n\\nand then to go to that number of one to three milligrams\\n\\nof caffeine per kilogram of body weight.\\n\\nAnd that's a good range in which you might want\\n\\nto explore the use of caffeine in a single application,\\n\\nmeaning in a single dose.\\n\\nNow, I do realize that some people out there\\n\\nare drinking coffee all day long,\\n\\nor having coffee in the morning,\\n\\nand then again in the afternoon.\\n\\nWhat I'm referring to here is the ingestion of caffeine\\n\\nin a single bout, right?\\n\\nOne cup of coffee, or two cups of coffee, for instance,\\n\\nto achieve that 100 to 300 milligram range,\\n\\nif that's what's appropriate for your body weight.\\n\\nBut to avoid any confusion,\\n\\nwhen I talk about dosage of caffeine,\\n\\nwhat I'm really talking about is not the total amount\\n\\nof caffeine ingested per day.\\n\\nI'm talking about the total amount of caffeine ingested\\n\\nin one sitting, or setting, that is.\\n\\nAnd if you're somebody who's drinking caffeine\\n\\nmultiple times throughout the day,\\n\\nyou could imagine, for instance,\\n\\nlet's say the appropriate dose for you\\n\\nin order to get an enhancement in mental performance\\n\\nor physical performance is 200 milligrams,\\n\\nand you are somebody who's doing some work in the morning,\\n\\nand you want to have that lift in the morning\\n\\nto be able to focus better,\\n\\nand you're doing some physical exercise in the afternoon,\\n\\nor vice versa, that you would ingest 200 milligrams\\n\\nof caffeine at two separate times per day,\\n\\nseparated by about four hours.\\n\\nNow, you don't have to separate them.\\n\\nYou could put them two hours apart, for instance,\\n\\nbut we'll talk about half-life of caffeine and so forth.\\n\\nJust keep in mind that if you're ingesting\\n\\n200 milligrams of caffeine,\\n\\nand that's the appropriate dose for you\\n\\nbased on your body weight,\\n\\nand then you are ingesting another 200 milligrams\\n\\nof caffeine an hour later,\\n\\nyou are effectively ingesting approximately\\n\\n400 milligrams of caffeine,\\n\\nwhich is going to start exceeding the dose\\n\\nin which you can normally tolerate\\n\\nwithout feeling anxious and jittery.\\n\\nWith all of that said,\\n\\nthere is a range of tolerance for caffeine\\n\\nthat's based on two things.\\n\\nOne is a pre-existing disposition,\\n\\nthat is whether or not your genetics\\n\\nand nervous system and the backdrop of your life,\\n\\nhow much stress you're experiencing,\\n\\ntends to make you feel more anxious and alert and jittery\\n\\nbefore you ingest any caffeine.\\n\\nAnd the other is how so-called caffeine adapted you are.\\n\\nWe often hear about tolerance.\\n\\nTolerance means something very specific.\\n\\nIt's the ability to ingest more and more of something\\n\\nwith a plateau that is a no increase\\n\\nor an actual reduction in the effectiveness of that thing.\\n\\nBut here, we're not really talking\\n\\nabout tolerance to caffeine.\\n\\nWhat we're talking about is being caffeine adapted.\\n\\nA simple way to understand\\n\\nwhether or not you're caffeine adapted or not\\n\\nis that if you drink caffeine\\n\\nand it tends to increase your heart rate\\n\\nand make you feel more alert and a bit more anxious,\\n\\nthen chances are you are not caffeine adapted,\\n\\nprovided the amount of caffeine\\n\\nis within the healthy range for you, that is,\\n\\nthe ranges we talked about a moment ago.\\n\\nHowever, if you're somebody who drinks caffeine\\n\\nand you actually feel alert and relaxed,\\n\\nchances are you are caffeine adapted.\\n\\nAnd so at various times during today's episode,\\n\\nI'll talk about people who are caffeine adapted\\n\\nand people who are not caffeine adapted.\\n\\nWe'll talk about the use of caffeine every other day.\\n\\nI know for you habitual caffeine drinkers,\\n\\nincluding myself, just the simple mention of that\\n\\nprobably sounds aversive,\\n\\nbut there is actually great utility\\n\\nto using caffeine every other day as opposed to every day.\\n\\nBut just keep in mind that some people will drink caffeine\\n\\nand not get much of a lift from it at all.\\n\\nOther people will drink caffeine\\n\\nand they will feel extremely anxious,\\n\\neven at dosages far lower than that\\n\\none to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight range\\n\\nthat I described a moment ago.\\n\\nSo you have to take into account individual differences.\\n\\nThat said, one to three milligrams of caffeine\\n\\nper kilogram of body weight for a given sitting,\\n\\nfor your morning coffee or your morning yerba mate tea\\n\\nis a good range from which to start.\\n\\nAnd I do encourage you to go online\\n\\nand look up the various beverages and foods\\n\\nthat you might be eating that contain caffeine.\\n\\nFor instance, some people are surprised to discover\\n\\nthat the coffee that they get\\n\\nfrom some of the more standard popular vendors out there,\\n\\nthe small coffee or the medium coffee, for instance,\\n\\ncan contain as much as 400 to 600 milligrams of caffeine.\\n\\nAnd that the large coffee that is often sold\\n\\nat those commercial vendors can contain as much as one gram,\\n\\n1,000 milligrams of caffeine.\\n\\nNow you may be adapted to that\\n\\nsuch that it doesn't make you feel anxious.\\n\\nBut if you wonder why you feel irritable\\n\\nand you get a headache when you don't get that caffeine\\n\\nor that amount of caffeine\\n\\nat precisely the time that you're used to getting it\\n\\neach day, that's because you are consuming\\n\\nquite large quantities of caffeine on a regular basis.\\n\\nSo I do recommend whether or not you drink soda\\n\\nor coffee or tea that you figure out the source of that.\\n\\nOkay, so figure out what vendor you purchase it from,\\n\\nwhat kind of coffee and go online\\n\\nand spend a little bit of time\\n\\nbecause the information is out there\\n\\nto discover what levels of caffeine\\n\\nyou're actually ingesting.\\n\\nNow, if you happen to be ingesting more than one\\n\\nto three milligrams per kilogram of body weight of caffeine,\\n\\nthat's not necessarily bad.\\n\\nHowever, you do want to be careful about ingesting\\n\\nvery high levels of caffeine over long periods of time\\n\\nin your life because there can be issues\\n\\nthat start to arise in particular,\\n\\na bias towards higher levels of anxiety\\n\\nand depletion of certain electrolytes\\n\\nbecause caffeine is a diuretic\\n\\ncan cause you to lose sodium\\n\\nand other things of that sort.\\n\\nAnd also just from simply a dependent standpoint,\\n\\nit does appear that if you ingest high levels of caffeine\\n\\nthat is exceeding the dosages\\n\\nthat normally you could get away with\\n\\nand get just as much mental enhancing\\n\\nand physical enhancing benefits\\n\\nthat you can cause some disruption to the microvasculature.\\n\\nYou can bias yourself towards headaches, anxiety attacks\\n\\nand you can become actually quite irritable\\n\\nwhen you're not getting those higher levels of caffeine.\\n\\nSo I do encourage you to figure out\\n\\nnot just what an appropriate caffeine dosage\\n\\nwould be for you,\\n\\nbut also how much caffeine you might already be ingesting.\\n\\nThe first tool I'd like to talk about\\n\\nis one that I've mentioned before\\n\\non this podcast several times.\\n\\nAnd it's something that if you haven't heard of\\n\\nwill be very useful to you.\\n\\nAnd if you have heard this tool before,\\n\\nI'm going to add some additional features\\n\\nto the description of this tool\\n\\nthat should make this worthwhile for you as well.\\n\\nAnd that is to delay your caffeine intake\\n\\nto 90 to 120 minutes after waking up on most days.\\n\\nAnd I'll be very clear as to days\\n\\nin which you might want to ingest caffeine\\n\\nmore closely to when you wake up.\\n\\nWhy would you want to delay your caffeine intake\\n\\nto 90 to 120 minutes after waking?\\n\\nThe answer to that is very simple.\\n\\nMany people wake up in the morning,\\n\\nthey drink caffeine within 10, 20, 30,\\n\\nsometimes within two minutes of waking\\n\\nand they feel more alert naturally.\\n\\nThat makes sense because of the effects of caffeine\\n\\nin blocking the effects of adenosine\\n\\nthat I talked about earlier\\n\\nand its effects on other neurotransmitter systems.\\n\\nBut then what they find is that in the early afternoon,\\n\\nin particular after lunch,\\n\\nthey experience a dramatic dip\\n\\nin their overall levels of energy,\\n\\nthe so-called afternoon crash.\\n\\nAnd in most cases, the way they respond to that\\n\\nis to ingest more caffeine,\\n\\nwhich indeed can increase their levels\\n\\nof mood and alertness.\\n\\nHowever, as we'll soon talk about,\\n\\nthere is a problem with ingesting caffeine in the afternoon\\n\\nif it falls within eight or 10,\\n\\nor dare I even say 12 hours of going to sleep.\\n\\nAnd that is the caffeine ingested in the afternoon\\n\\nfor most everybody,\\n\\nlet's say for 95 plus percent of people\\n\\ndisrupts the architecture and quality\\n\\nof their nighttime sleep.\\n\\nAnd I should say that it doesn't necessarily\\n\\nimpact their ability to fall asleep\\n\\nand maybe even sleep through the night,\\n\\nbut that the depth and quality of that sleep is disrupted\\n\\nby consuming caffeine in the afternoon.\\n\\nA little bit later, I'll talk about how you can offset\\n\\nsome of those negative effects\\n\\nif you absolutely require caffeine in the afternoon.\\n\\nBut there's a huge advantage\\n\\nto restricting your caffeine intake\\n\\nto the early part of your day,\\n\\nbut not consuming caffeine\\n\\nwithin the first 90 to 120 minutes after waking.\\n\\nIn fact, many people find\\n\\nthat if they delay their caffeine intake\\n\\nto 90 to 120 minutes after waking up,\\n\\nthat they feel more alert in the morning\\n\\nand they completely avoid that afternoon crash.\\n\\nNow that said, many people, including myself,\\n\\ndo need a short nap or non-sleep deep rest\\n\\nor other form of relaxation\\n\\nfor 10 to 30 minutes in the afternoon.\\n\\nThat is natural and healthy.\\n\\nI'm not referring to the need for that\\n\\nwhen I refer to the so-called afternoon crash.\\n\\nWhat I'm talking about in the afternoon crash\\n\\nis an inability to recover energy and focus\\n\\nand a need to consume more caffeine\\n\\njust to make it through the afternoon.\\n\\nBy delaying caffeine intake\\n\\nto 90 to 120 minutes after waking,\\n\\nthere are a couple of things that are accomplished.\\n\\nFirst of all, you offset that afternoon crash\\n\\nand this is an effect that many people experience\\n\\nthe very first time they start delaying their caffeine intake\\n\\nto 90 to 120 minutes after waking.\\n\\nAnd the reason this works so well is the following.\\n\\nAs I mentioned earlier, adenosine is a molecule\\n\\nthat builds up the longer that we are awake.\\n\\nIt is a molecule that is reduced\\n\\nor cleared from our system by sleep.\\n\\nSo when we emerge from sleep,\\n\\nregardless of how long we've slept,\\n\\nour adenosine levels are lower than they were\\n\\nwhen we went to sleep the previous night.\\n\\nIf you slept well enough and long enough,\\n\\nthose adenosine levels can be very, very low,\\n\\nbut they are never completely zero.\\n\\nWhen you wake up in the morning,\\n\\neven if you're one of these people\\n\\nthat springs out of bed and is ready to attack the day,\\n\\nand here I'm certainly not describing myself.\\n\\nI'm not one of those people.\\n\\nI tend to wake fairly slowly.\\n\\nBut if you're one of those spring up and attack the day\\n\\nor you're one of the people\\n\\nwho moves more slowly into your day,\\n\\nregardless, there's still some residual adenosine\\n\\nin your system.\\n\\nAnd it's particularly the case\\n\\nif you did not get enough sleep\\n\\nor enough depth of sleep the night before,\\n\\nthe correct ratios of slow wave sleep\\n\\nand rapid eye movement sleep.\\n\\nAnd for those of you interested in optimizing sleep,\\n\\nI'll just refer you to our master your sleep episode\\n\\nof the Huberman Lab podcast,\\n\\nthe perfect your sleep episode of the Huberman Lab podcast.\\n\\nAnd we have a toolkit for sleep,\\n\\nall of which are available, zero cost, timestamped, et cetera\\n\\nat hubermanlab.com.\\n\\nYou wake up in the morning\\n\\nand your adenosine levels are low, but they're not zero.\\n\\nAnd if you didn't sleep that well\\n\\nor deeply enough the night before,\\n\\nyou're going to have more adenosine in your system.\\n\\nYou might think the logical thing to do\\n\\nis therefore to drink caffeine\\n\\nand to block the adenosine that's there.\\n\\nBut what happens if you do that is there's an accumulation,\\n\\na sort of glut of adenosine that hangs around.\\n\\nAnd then in the afternoon,\\n\\nwhen the effects of that caffeine start to wear off,\\n\\nyou will experience the so-called afternoon crash.\\n\\nAs I mentioned earlier,\\n\\nthere is a way to clear out the adenosine that's present\\n\\nwhen you wake up in the morning\\n\\nand to clear it out essentially completely\\n\\nwithout just blocking its receptors\\n\\nand letting it accumulate or hang around.\\n\\nAnd the way to do that\\n\\nis to deliberately spike your cortisol.\\n\\nNow, many of you have heard of cortisol,\\n\\nthe so-called stress hormone as a bad thing.\\n\\nAnd indeed chronically elevated cortisol is a bad thing.\\n\\nIt depletes your immune system.\\n\\nIt's bad for psychosocial effects.\\n\\nIt tends to make us feel anxious and on and on.\\n\\nBut cortisol itself is not bad.\\n\\nCortisol is wonderful.\\n\\nCortisol enhances the efficiency of the immune system.\\n\\nIt makes us alert and focus.\\n\\nIt stimulates our metabolism.\\n\\nIt does a huge number of positive things\\n\\nprovided that it is released in a circadian fashion,\\n\\nthat is at the appropriate times every 24 hours\\n\\nand that it tends to peak very close to waking.\\n\\nIn fact, one of the reasons you wake up in the morning\\n\\nassuming that you weren't woken up by some noise\\n\\nor sleeping in an environment that's too warm, et cetera,\\n\\nis that your cortisol levels start to rise.\\n\\nAnd shortly after waking,\\n\\nyour cortisol levels will start to reach their peak.\\n\\nAnd when I refer to a cortisol pulse,\\n\\nthat's just biology nerd speak\\n\\nfor a rise and peak in cortisol.\\n\\nYou want that cortisol pulse\\n\\nto occur early in the day close to waking.\\n\\nAnd you want that for a couple of reasons.\\n\\nFirst of all, if you don't restrict that cortisol pulse\\n\\nearly in the day,\\n\\nit will tend to bleed into the later parts of the day.\\n\\nAnd actually a late shifted cortisol peak\\n\\nis one of the hallmark signatures of depression,\\n\\nlow level depression and serious depression.\\n\\nAnd it can start to disrupt sleep\\n\\nand certainly can disrupt mood, metabolism\\n\\nand your immune system.\\n\\nSo you want that cortisol peak early in the day.\\n\\nHow do you ensure that that happens?\\n\\nWell, you wake up in the morning\\n\\nand whether or not you're a bounce out of bed type\\n\\nor you're more groggy,\\n\\nyou know, kind of wade slowly into the day type like I am,\\n\\nyou wake up and you don't ingest caffeine,\\n\\nfine and in fact, beneficial to hydrate\\n\\nwith water and electrolytes.\\n\\nTerrific, in fact, I would say,\\n\\nnecessary to get bright light in your eyes,\\n\\nideally from sunlight.\\n\\nI've talked about this many, many times before\\n\\non the podcast.\\n\\nIf you wake up before the sun comes out,\\n\\nthen turn on bright artificial lights.\\n\\nBut then certainly once the sun is out\\n\\nand even on cloudy days, in fact,\\n\\nespecially on cloudy days,\\n\\nget outside for anywhere from five to 20,\\n\\nmaybe even 30 minutes, do some work outside,\\n\\ntake your breakfast outside.\\n\\nIf you're a breakfast eater, get something done outside,\\n\\neven if it's just to get outside\\n\\nand get bright light in your eyes, why?\\n\\nWell, because it's been shown in studies on humans\\n\\nthat getting bright light in your eyes\\n\\nin the first hour after waking\\n\\nor as soon as possible after waking,\\n\\nincreases the peak of that cortisol pulse by 50%, five zero.\\n\\nAnd that cortisol pulse, yes, increases mood,\\n\\nyes, increases alertness,\\n\\nbut it does one other very important thing,\\n\\nwhich is that through an indirect pathway,\\n\\nit can clear out any residual adenosine\\n\\nthat might be present in your system\\n\\nwhen you wake up in the morning.\\n\\nAgain, this is going to be especially important\\n\\nfor those of you that are not getting as much sleep\\n\\nor as much quality sleep as you would like.\\n\\nIt's going to be very important\\n\\nfor you to get that morning bright light,\\n\\nideally from sunlight, get that cortisol peak going.\\n\\nOther ways to increase that cortisol peak\\n\\nwould be to do some physical activity.\\n\\nIf you don't have time to do a full workout,\\n\\nwell then getting some movement,\\n\\n10 minutes of skipping rope\\n\\nor even five minutes of skipping rope or jumping jacks\\n\\nor walking if that's all you have time for,\\n\\nideally while getting the sunlight in your eyes.\\n\\nBut that's going to zero out\\n\\nthe adenosine present in your system.\\n\\nIf, however, you were to wake up\\n\\nand immediately drink caffeine,\\n\\ncaffeine itself can stimulate the release of cortisol\\n\\na little bit more than it would otherwise\\n\\nbe present in your system.\\n\\nBut by blocking those adenosine receptors\\n\\nand because of the indirect effects of caffeine\\n\\non the cortisol system,\\n\\nyou actually are reducing the clearance of adenosine\\n\\nthat would otherwise occur.\\n\\nSo I realize that's a mouthful.\\n\\nJust to be very clear,\\n\\nif you wake up and you ingest caffeine right away,\\n\\nyou're blocking the adenosine receptor\\n\\nbut you're not clearing it out.\\n\\nYou're also preventing cortisol\\n\\nfrom having its normal increase in rise\\n\\nsuch that it can directly clear out adenosine\\n\\nbecause cortisol can clear out adenosine.\\n\\nAnd that's what you want.\\n\\nYou want to be at maximum alertness and focus\\n\\nin your morning and throughout your day.\\n\\nAnd by delaying your caffeine\\n\\nto 90 to 120 minutes after waking,\\n\\nyou set up your system\\n\\nso that you get that morning cortisol peak,\\n\\nideally a peak that's even greater\\n\\nbecause you're getting your bright light viewing.\\n\\nAnd then when you ingest your caffeine 90 to 120 minutes\\n\\nafter waking,\\n\\nnot only will you be craving it just a little bit,\\n\\nbut you will be drinking that caffeine\\n\\non an already existing backdrop of increased alertness\\n\\nfor two reasons.\\n\\nOne is adenosine is zeroed out\\n\\nand your cortisol peak is higher.\\n\\nAnd so now when you ingest caffeine,\\n\\nyou can actually ingest levels of caffeine\\n\\nthat are a little more reasonable\\n\\nthat almost with certainty are going to fall\\n\\nin this one to three milligrams per kilogram dosage\\n\\nand will allow you to feel really alert\\n\\nand will carry that alertness\\n\\nwell into the afternoon hours\\n\\nwithout the need to drink more caffeine\\n\\nand thereby will prevent you from drinking caffeine\\n\\nand disrupting your nighttime sleep.\\n\\nAnd of course, by getting better nighttime sleep,\\n\\nyou're going to zero out your adenosine even more.\\n\\nSo what I'm describing here are essentially two tools.\\n\\nI'm telling you to get morning sunlight\\n\\nand maybe some exercise in conjunction with that,\\n\\neven if it's brief exercise.\\n\\nBut the main tool of delaying caffeine 90 to 120 minutes\\n\\nafter waking has immediate effects,\\n\\nbut it also sets in motion a cascade or domino falls\\n\\nthat lead to better sleep and more wakefulness\\n\\nthe next night and the next day and so on and so forth.\\n\\nNow I realize there are some people\\n\\nwho just simply cannot or will not delay their caffeine\\n\\n90 to 120 minutes after waking for whatever reason.\\n\\nFirst off, let me say that if you are somebody\\n\\nwho likes to wake up and do very intense exercise\\n\\nwithin the first 90 minutes after waking,\\n\\nwell, in that case, it would be appropriate\\n\\nto ingest your caffeine just prior to doing that exercise.\\n\\nNot a problem, not a problem.\\n\\nBut you should expect that the combination\\n\\nof drinking caffeine very shortly after waking\\n\\nplus exercising very intensely shortly after waking\\n\\nwill increase the intensity of that early afternoon\\n\\nand afternoon fatigue that you feel.\\n\\nNow, for some people, that's a great thing.\\n\\nThey can afford to take a nap or do non-sleep deep rest,\\n\\nstep away from work and so forth.\\n\\nIn that case, I strongly encourage you to do\\n\\nwhatever it is that allows you to get regular exercise\\n\\nbecause regular exercise is going to be very beneficial.\\n\\nIn fact, we did an entire episode called Toolkit for Fitness\\n\\nthat describes a couple of different,\\n\\nbut really one main structure that allows you\\n\\nto get the appropriate amount of resistance training\\n\\nand cardiovascular training and flexibility training\\n\\nthroughout the week.\\n\\nI happen to follow that program\\n\\nand it works very well and it does involve\\n\\nsome of those workouts to come very early in the morning\\n\\nshortly after waking.\\n\\nAnd in those cases, I do ingest caffeine\\n\\njust prior to those.\\n\\nSo within 10, 20 minutes of waking.\\n\\nHowever, on other days,\\n\\nI personally delay my caffeine intake 90 to 120 minutes\\n\\nand I've done that to great benefit.\\n\\nAnd most people, if not all people that try that\\n\\nhave reported the same.\\n\\nI should mention that some people will find getting out\\n\\nto that 90 minutes to be excruciatingly difficult\\n\\nbecause they're so accustomed to ingesting caffeine\\n\\nclose to waking up.\\n\\nIn that case, maybe just push out your caffeine intake\\n\\nby about 15 minutes each day\\n\\nuntil you hit that 90 to 120 minute mark.\\n\\nAnd that will make it much easier.\\n\\nIt might take you a week or so to get there,\\n\\nbut once you get there,\\n\\nyou'll find it to be quite easy to maintain.\\n\\nThe other thing is that if you are somebody\\n\\nwho insists on drinking caffeine very shortly after waking,\\n\\nI would encourage you to drink half of your caffeine then\\n\\nand then the other half of your caffeine\\n\\nabout an hour later.\\n\\nThat also will help offset some of the afternoon crash\\n\\nfor reasons related to the so-called kinetics of caffeine.\\n\\nCaffeine has a quarter life of about 12 hours.\\n\\nThat means that if you were to ingest a cup of coffee\\n\\nat let's say 8 a.m. and let's say 100 milligram coffee,\\n\\njust for sake of simplicity,\\n\\nthat about 25% of that caffeine action,\\n\\nwe wouldn't really say 25 milligrams,\\n\\nbut about 25% of that caffeine action\\n\\nwill still be present at 8 p.m. that night,\\n\\nwhich is pretty remarkable.\\n\\nSo there's a long arc of caffeine effects\\n\\nand this is why it can impede sleep\\n\\nif we take caffeine in the afternoon.\\n\\nBut again, if you're somebody who wakes up\\n\\nand you really need caffeine right away\\n\\nand you refuse to do this 90 to 120 minute delay thing\\n\\nthat I'm talking about, well then in that case,\\n\\nI would drink half of your caffeine upon waking\\n\\nand then a little bit more or the other half\\n\\nabout an hour later,\\n\\nand that will extend the arc of that caffeine effects\\n\\nsuch that you don't need it again in the afternoon\\n\\nbecause you won't experience the afternoon crash.\\n\\nBecause of the way caffeine works,\\n\\nI should mention that if you ingest caffeine\\n\\non an empty stomach,\\n\\nit will have a more potent stimulant effect.\\n\\nThat will also tend to increase the level of jitteriness\\n\\nthat caffeine can produce.\\n\\nLater, I'll talk about ways to offset that jitteriness,\\n\\nbut I'll just tell you one tool now.\\n\\nMany people opt to take 100 milligrams\\n\\nof theanine as a way to offset some of that jitteriness.\\n\\nTheanine will reduce the jitteriness of caffeine,\\n\\nwhich is why many energy drink manufacturers\\n\\nand even some coffee manufacturers\\n\\nare now putting theanine in energy drinks\\n\\nand in ground coffee because, no surprise,\\n\\nit allows people to consume more of that beverage\\n\\nand thereby purchase more of that beverage,\\n\\nwhich is what these vendors want,\\n\\nwithout feeling overly anxious and jittery.\\n\\nSo you can take Pilform Theanine\\n\\nif you want with your caffeine.\\n\\nI don't tend to do that.\\n\\nRather, I control the total dosage of my caffeine.\\n\\nI do tend to consume caffeine on an empty stomach\\n\\nbecause I do restrict my caffeine intake\\n\\nto the early part of the day.\\n\\nAnd I generally eat my first meal somewhere around 11 a.m.\\n\\nAnd then I generally eat my last meal sometime\\n\\naround 8 p.m. or so.\\n\\nThose are averages, I would say, plus or minus an hour.\\n\\nAnd that's not because I'm religiously following\\n\\nany kind of time-restricted feeding.\\n\\nThat tends to work best with my schedule and my appetite.\\n\\nBut again, that's a general theme.\\n\\nThere are days in which I wake up and I'm very hungry\\n\\nand I might ingest something, a small snack or something,\\n\\nor if I'm meeting somebody for breakfast,\\n\\nsometimes I'll have breakfast, sometimes I won't,\\n\\nand so on and so forth.\\n\\nThe point is that you can get away\\n\\nwith drinking less caffeine to get the stimulant effect\\n\\nif you do it on an empty stomach.\\n\\nAnd if you're somebody who likes to exercise\\n\\non an empty stomach, and I'm one of those people,\\n\\nwell then, ingesting caffeine just prior to exercise\\n\\ncan be a fantastic tool.\\n\\nA little bit later, we'll talk about some of the\\n\\nphysical performance-enhancing effects of caffeine,\\n\\nbut I'll just briefly jump to a point about that\\n\\nas we relate to morning exercise.\\n\\nIf you are somebody who regularly ingests caffeine,\\n\\nand we can define regularly by,\\n\\nif you've ingested caffeine every day\\n\\nfor the last two weeks, you're a regular consumer of caffeine.\\n\\nWhereas if you're somebody who only ingests caffeine\\n\\nsomewhere between two and four times per week,\\n\\nwell then, you are not a regular consumer of caffeine.\\n\\nYou're an intermittent user of caffeine.\\n\\nWell, if you're somebody who's a regular user of caffeine,\\n\\nthe performance-enhancing effects of caffeine\\n\\nare going to be most dramatic\\n\\nif you take two or three days off from drinking caffeine,\\n\\nwhich to my mind, I don't want to call myself a caffeine addict,\\n\\nbut a regular caffeine user, that's a horrible notion to me.\\n\\nIt is an aversive notion\\n\\nbecause I do like the effects of caffeine so much.\\n\\nBut if you really want to see the maximum performance\\n\\nenhancing effects of caffeine,\\n\\nyou'll do either one of two things.\\n\\nYou will either abstain from caffeine for a few days\\n\\nor three days prior to ingesting caffeine,\\n\\nor you will use caffeine on an empty stomach.\\n\\nIt's very clear that caffeine on an empty stomach\\n\\nenhances both the mental\\n\\nand physical enhancing effects of caffeine.\\n\\nAnd of course, all of that has to be stated\\n\\non the backdrop of consideration that if you,\\n\\nyou're very, very hungry,\\n\\nit can make it hard to concentrate and so on and so forth.\\n\\nSo I'm not encouraging people to starve themselves\\n\\nby any means, certainly don't do that.\\n\\nBut if you want to maximize\\n\\nthe performance enhancing effects of caffeine,\\n\\nyou will consume it on an empty stomach.\\n\\nAnd then as a final point to that,\\n\\ncaffeine is a diuretic, it causes us to lose fluid\\n\\nand along with that fluid to excrete sodium\\n\\nbecause of the effects of caffeine\\n\\non various processes within the kidney.\\n\\nSo one thing that works very well\\n\\nto maintain mood and alertness,\\n\\nlonger given a certain amount of caffeine intake\\n\\nand to avoid the jitteriness\\n\\nand what can sometimes feel like a crash\\n\\nor low blood sugar feeling or even blurry vision\\n\\nis to make sure that you consume\\n\\nat least an equal volume of water with your caffeine.\\n\\nAnd ideally that water would contain\\n\\nmaybe a small pinch of salt\\n\\nor some sort of electrolyte drink or powder rather.\\n\\nFor me, I use Element, full disclosure,\\n\\nthey are a podcast affiliate and sponsor,\\n\\nbut you don't need to do that.\\n\\nYou could simply just have a glass of water\\n\\nalongside your coffee or espresso or your yerba mate\\n\\nand just put a small pinch of sea salt in that\\n\\nor even just plain table salt.\\n\\nAnd that will help offset\\n\\nsome of the jitteriness of caffeine.\\n\\nA lot of people think that when they ingest caffeine,\\n\\nthey get the jitteriness and crash\\n\\nbecause their blood sugar is low.\\n\\nAnd while that can be the case,\\n\\noftentimes it's simply because of the excretion of sodium\\n\\nthat's occurred when they've ingested caffeine.\\n\\nSo I encourage you to hydrate well\\n\\nand to hydrate with something\\n\\nthat contains a little bit of sodium.\\n\\nObviously not so much that increases hypertension\\n\\nor something of that sort,\\n\\nbut a small amount of sodium or an electrolyte drink\\n\\nlike Element and there are other electrolyte drinks\\n\\nout there that can accomplish the same, of course.\\n\\nJust a couple of quick notes about theanine\\n\\nbecause there are a growing number of products out there\\n\\nthat contain theanine.\\n\\nAnd there's certainly a growing number of people out there\\n\\nwho are using theanine for the effect that I described\\n\\nbefore, which is to offset some of the jitteriness\\n\\nassociated with caffeine containing beverages or foods.\\n\\nAnd of course, I should mention that I've talked about\\n\\nthe effects of theanine on sleep\\n\\nat that sleep toolkit that you can find as a free download.\\n\\nYou don't even have to sign up for anything.\\n\\nYou can just download it from hubermanlab.com,\\n\\ngo to the menu, go to newsletter,\\n\\nyou'll see the toolkit for sleep.\\n\\nYou'll see that the so-called sleep stack\\n\\nthat I use and recommend includes magnesium threonate,\\n\\nsomething called apigenin and theanine.\\n\\nAlthough that sleep stack is designed to be taken\\n\\n30 to 60 minutes prior to sleep.\\n\\nAnd I make the point there and I'll make it again here\\n\\nthat ingesting theanine prior to sleep is not a good idea.\\n\\nIf you are somebody who tends to have very vivid dreams,\\n\\nnight terrors or night sleepwalking, excuse me, et cetera.\\n\\nIn that case, eliminate theanine from the sleep stack.\\n\\nHowever, a number of people are using theanine\\n\\nand products are using theanine to offset jitteriness\\n\\nfrom caffeine containing products during the daytime,\\n\\ndaytime consumption that is.\\n\\nA couple of notes about theanine.\\n\\nTheanine is something that is present in green tea.\\n\\nIt's now been created as a supplement.\\n\\nIt's what's called a non-protein amino acid.\\n\\nSo while there are amino acids in proteins,\\n\\nthere are of course amino acids in non-proteins\\n\\nand theanine is one such non-protein amino acid.\\n\\nTheanine tends to stimulate the so-called glutamate\\n\\nand glutamine pathway.\\n\\nIt's actually very similar to glutamate and glutamine.\\n\\nAnd it has a lot of effects on a lot of different aspects\\n\\nof the nervous system.\\n\\nBut the general effect of theanine is to compete\\n\\nfor the receptors for certain neurotransmitters\\n\\nand the neurotransmitters I'm referring to\\n\\nare all excitatory neurotransmitters,\\n\\nthings like glutamate,\\n\\nand they govern a tremendous amount\\n\\nof our daily thinking and action and feeling, et cetera,\\n\\nbecause they're present at so many connections\\n\\nbetween neurons in the brain.\\n\\nTheanine competes for the receptors for glutamate\\n\\nand tends to reduce our overall levels of alertness.\\n\\nSo really when people take theanine along with caffeine,\\n\\nwhat they're doing is they're really taking a slight,\\n\\nI don't want to call it depressant to the point\\n\\nwhere it misleads people\\n\\nand makes people think that it will make you depressed.\\n\\nThe word is a little bit misleading,\\n\\nbut tends to reduce or blunt some of the more excitatory\\n\\npro alertness actions of neurons in the brain.\\n\\nSo when you take it alongside caffeine,\\n\\ntends to quote unquote even things out a bit.\\n\\nI should mention that the dosages of theanine\\n\\nthat are effective for offsetting the jitteriness of caffeine\\n\\nis 200 to 400 milligrams.\\n\\nAnd the studies that I was able to find\\n\\nshowed that essentially up to 900 milligrams per day\\n\\ncan be safe, but that's a very high dosage of theanine.\\n\\nIn fact, so much so that it might increase sleepiness\\n\\nto the point where it wouldn't feel good.\\n\\nThere are also some positive effects\\n\\nof daytime consumption of theanine\\n\\nthat are independent of reducing the jitteriness of caffeine.\\n\\nFor instance, there's a study demonstrating\\n\\nthat 17 days of ingesting theanine\\n\\nat these 200 to 400 milligram dosage\\n\\nof one to three times per day\\n\\ncan reduce depression and anxiety.\\n\\nThere are also some good data out there\\n\\nshowing that theanine can have positive effects\\n\\non endothelial cells, so blood vessels, capillaries,\\n\\nand so on, and increase some of the function\\n\\nof blood vessels, allowing them to pass more blood\\n\\nthrough them and give them a little bit more elasticity,\\n\\nif you will.\\n\\nSo theanine has certain pro sleep effects\\n\\nif it's taken prior to sleep.\\n\\nIt can enhance the quality, depth, and duration of sleep.\\n\\nAgain, if you're a sleepwalker\\n\\nor somebody who has extremely vivid dreams\\n\\nfrom which you wake up in the middle of the night,\\n\\nprobably best to leave out theanine\\n\\nor maybe reduce the dosage down to 100 milligrams,\\n\\nand if that's still too much, then eliminate it completely.\\n\\nBut theanine can be terrific for enhancing quality,\\n\\ndepth, and duration of sleep.\\n\\nIt can also reduce the jitteriness\\n\\nassociated with caffeine-containing beverages and foods,\\n\\nand it has certain antidepressant\\n\\nand pro-endothelial effects.\\n\\nThat is, it can offset depression, it can offset anxiety,\\n\\nalthough those are minor effects, okay, subtle effects,\\n\\nand it has been shown to improve endothelial cell,\\n\\nthat is, vessel and capillary function and structure,\\n\\nin ways that can be beneficial for both brain and body.\\n\\nNow, one final point about theanine\\n\\nthat's worth paying attention to\\n\\nis that the kinetics of theanine are such\\n\\nthat you don't need to take theanine\\n\\nevery time you ingest a caffeinated beverage.\\n\\nWhen we ingest caffeine,\\n\\nthe peak effects of caffeine occur about 30 minutes\\n\\nafter we drink it,\\n\\nand there I'm assuming one takes it all at once,\\n\\nand this is a key point that we'll come back to later,\\n\\nrather than sipping your coffee slowly\\n\\nover a couple of hours or an hour.\\n\\nIf you drink all 200 or 300 milligrams of caffeine\\n\\nin your coffee, or 600 milligrams of your coffee,\\n\\nif you're getting one of those commercial coffees,\\n\\nand you take theanine along with it,\\n\\ntheanine will block some of the jitteriness\\n\\nand anxiety-inducing effects of caffeine\\n\\nthat can occur for much longer\\n\\nthan the effects that caffeine lasts.\\n\\nSo the peak in theanine occurs\\n\\nabout an hour after ingestion.\\n\\nI suppose if you want to get really fancy\\n\\nand really dial in the kinetics,\\n\\nyou could ingest theanine about half hour\\n\\nbefore you ingest your caffeine,\\n\\nbut I think that's getting a little bit excessive\\n\\nin terms of controlling your micro environment,\\n\\nif you will.\\n\\nI think it would be perfectly fine\\n\\nto take a 100 to 200 milligram capsule of theanine\\n\\nalong with your coffee or tea and so forth,\\n\\nand just realize that if you drink more caffeine\\n\\nor you extend your caffeine intake over several hours,\\n\\nthat you don't necessarily have to take theanine\\n\\nrepeated times throughout the day.\\n\\nI'd like to take a brief break\\n\\nand thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.\\n\\nInsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform\\n\\nthat analyzes data from your blood and

one of the major myths around caffeine\\n\\nis that it can increase osteoporosis.\\n\\nTurns out that while there is a relationship, of course,\\n\\nbetween calcium and osteoporosis,\\n\\nthat is reductions in bone density,\\n\\nand it is the case that caffeine\\n\\ncan extract calcium from certain tissues,\\n\\nthe large scale studies that are out there\\n\\nessentially prove that if people are ingesting\\n\\nenough calcium through their diet, which most everybody is,\\n\\nalthough certainly there are some people\\n\\nthat need to supplement calcium\\n\\nor make it a point to consume more calcium containing foods,\\n\\nbut assuming that you are getting adequate levels of calcium,\\n\\nthere is no direct relationship\\n\\nbetween caffeine intake and osteoporosis,\\n\\nat least not that I'm aware of.\\n\\nI know this was debated for a number of years\\n\\nin the literature,\\n\\nbut the literature seems to have arrived\\n\\nat a general consensus now that caffeine itself\\n\\nis not going to create or exacerbate osteoporosis\\n\\nprovided people are getting enough calcium\\n\\nthrough their diet, that is through foods,\\n\\nthrough supplementation or both.\\n\\nSome of the other myths around caffeine are that,\\n\\nfor instance, caffeine will reduce testosterone levels\\n\\nor will reduce estrogen levels.\\n\\nOther myths out there are in exact opposite to that,\\n\\nthat caffeine will increase testosterone levels\\n\\nin particular free testosterone levels.\\n\\nThere've been some large scale studies\\n\\naddressing the hormone effects of caffeine.\\n\\nThey are a little bit difficult to do.\\n\\nI should just mention that caveat.\\n\\nAnd the reason they are difficult to do\\n\\nis because 90% of adults are consuming caffeine.\\n\\nAnd therefore you can imagine,\\n\\nit's very hard to find a control group\\n\\nto compare the caffeine consumers to.\\n\\nIn particular, a control group that's well controlled\\n\\nfor other things like lifestyle, diet, exercise, et cetera.\\n\\nHowever, when one controls as well as one can\\n\\nfor all the various factors that could impact hormones,\\n\\nwhat one discovers is that caffeine intake,\\n\\nat least at the dosages we talked about earlier,\\n\\none to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight\\n\\nor even up to double that,\\n\\nthat there are no consistent increases or reductions\\n\\nin testosterone or estrogen in men or women\\n\\nthat can be directly attributed to the caffeine intake.\\n\\nAnd I say directly attributed\\n\\nbecause in these association studies,\\n\\none always has to wonder, for instance,\\n\\nif because people are ingesting more caffeine,\\n\\nthey have more energy and therefore exercising more\\n\\nand exercise is known to have effects\\n\\non testosterone, estrogen and other hormones,\\n\\nwhether or not the effects of caffeine\\n\\non those hormones is indirect and so on and so forth.\\n\\nAnd this all just underscores the challenges\\n\\nof doing studies on humans in the wild,\\n\\nin their natural habitat of living,\\n\\nas opposed to an acute study as it's called\\n\\nto bring someone into the laboratory\\n\\nand studying them just for those hours or moments.\\n\\nWith all that said, there does appear to be a relationship\\n\\nbetween caffeine intake and so-called sex hormone\\n\\nand binding globulin, which is a protein present\\n\\nin the body of both men and women\\n\\nthat binds to the sex steroid hormones,\\n\\ntestosterone and estrogen,\\n\\nand prevents them from being in their free or active form.\\n\\nIt has been shown that ingestion of caffeine,\\n\\neven in the sorts dosage ranges that are considered safe\\n\\nand that we've been discussing,\\n\\ncan increase sex hormone binding globulin\\n\\nsuch that it can slightly reduce overall levels\\n\\nof free testosterone and free estradiol in women.\\n\\nNow those effects are relatively minor, but they do exist.\\n\\nIf any of you are interested in reading further\\n\\ninto the effects of caffeine on hormones,\\n\\nI'll just refer you to a couple of studies.\\n\\nWe will link to this in the show note caption.\\n\\nThe title of the study is consumption of caffeinated\\n\\nbeverages and serum concentrations\\n\\nof sex steroid hormones in US men.\\n\\nAnd within this study, there's a reference\\n\\nto a equally sized empowered study done on women,\\n\\nboth of which converged on the same conclusion\\n\\nby examining more than a thousand,\\n\\nso in this case, 1,410 men or more than a thousand women,\\n\\nthat there are increases in sex hormone binding globulin\\n\\nassociated with increased intake of coffee in particular,\\n\\nbut they were able to narrow that down specifically\\n\\nto ingestion of caffeine.\\n\\nSo it's not coffee per se that's causing the increase\\n\\nin sex hormone binding globulin,\\n\\nit's actually caffeine itself.\\n\\nNow, again, the increases in sex hormone binding globulin\\n\\nwere not so significant that at least to my mind,\\n\\nthey seem like a concern,\\n\\nalthough I think that it is worth noting\\n\\nthat if you're going to consume caffeine,\\n\\nthat you'd probably want to consume caffeine\\n\\nin a way that is in dosages and with the sort of timing\\n\\nthat will allow you to get away with ingesting caffeine,\\n\\nbut not to excess.\\n\\nSo to derive the benefits of caffeine without,\\n\\nfor instance, driving up sex hormone binding globulin too far.\\n\\nNow, why would that be a good idea?\\n\\nWhy would you want to make sure\\n\\nthat you have enough free testosterone and free estrogen?\\n\\nWell, some of that is related to the acute effects\\n\\nof those hormones in terms of wellbeing\\n\\nand libido and strength and mood, et cetera.\\n\\nBut some of it is also related to the longer term effects\\n\\nof sex steroid hormones.\\n\\nMany people don't realize this,\\n\\nbut the sex steroid hormones operate on the receptors\\n\\nat the surface of cells to have immediate effects,\\n\\nbut they also can enter cells\\n\\nand actually go into the nucleus of cells\\n\\nwhere the DNA of those cells are contained\\n\\nand control gene expression in those cells.\\n\\nSo the sex steroid hormones, testosterone and estrogen\\n\\nare controlling a lot of different cellular functions\\n\\nover long periods of time.\\n\\nSo blunting their action over long periods of time\\n\\nis probably not a great idea.\\n\\nBut again, at the dosages of caffeine\\n\\nthat we're talking about today,\\n\\none to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight,\\n\\nunlikely that the increases in sex hormone binding globulin\\n\\nthat one experiences from that are going to be detrimental.\\n\\nAnd certainly the positive effects of caffeine\\n\\nthat one experiences in terms of mental performance\\n\\nand physical performance,\\n\\nand the fact that it increases energy\\n\\nto do the sorts of things like exercise\\n\\nthat we know can profoundly improve hormone profiles.\\n\\nTwo-fold or three-fold improvement in hormone profiles.\\n\\nIn that case, it seems that ingesting caffeine\\n\\nis overall a good thing, provided it's not in excess.\\n\\nThat also makes this the appropriate time to mention\\n\\none of the more impressive effects of caffeine,\\n\\nwhich is on overall levels of mood and mental health.\\n\\nThere are several studies on this,\\n\\nbut the one that I'm particularly fond of\\n\\nwas published in 2019 in Psychiatry Research,\\n\\nand the title of the paper is\\n\\nInverse Association Between Caffeine Intake\\n\\nand Depressive Symptoms in U.S. Adults.\\n\\nAnd these are data from the National Health\\n\\nand Nutrition Examination Survey.\\n\\nAnd the basic takeaway is that while, of course,\\n\\nthere are a ton of different factors\\n\\nthat are going to relate to whether or not\\n\\npeople are depressed or not,\\n\\nlife circumstances, genetics, and so on,\\n\\nthat, and here I'm quoting from the study,\\n\\ncaffeine's psychostimulant properties,\\n\\nthat just means the ability to make us feel more alert\\n\\nand positive, appear to protect against depressive symptoms.\\n\\nAnd, of course, they acknowledge\\n\\nthat additional studies are needed.\\n\\nBut this is just one of several studies\\n\\npointing to the fact that people who regularly\\n\\ningest caffeine in the appropriate dosages\\n\\ndo seem to enjoy an anti-depressive effect overall.\\n\\nI wouldn't want anyone to consider caffeine\\n\\na treatment for severe depression,\\n\\nor at least not alone a treatment for severe depression.\\n\\nBut provided the anxiety-inducing effects of caffeine\\n\\ncan be kept in check through use of theanine\\n\\nor making sure that the dosage\\n\\nand the timing of caffeine ingestion is correct,\\n\\nthen caffeine overall seems to be good for our mood\\n\\nand prevent depression, or at least keep depression at bay\\n\\nwhen depression might otherwise surface or be more severe.\\n\\nAnd, of course, there are the don'ts\\n\\nsurrounding caffeine intake.\\n\\nAs it relates to sleep, and to put it very simply,\\n\\nsleep, that is getting enough quality sleep each night,\\n\\nis the foundation, it is the bedrock of mental health,\\n\\nphysical health, and performance.\\n\\nSleep and the power of sleep far exceeds\\n\\nany nootropic you could ever take,\\n\\nany prescription drug you could ever take,\\n\\nany health-promoting tool for your immune system,\\n\\nyour metabolism, your mental function,\\n\\nyour physical function you could ever take.\\n\\nSleep is the bedrock.\\n\\nI know a lot of people experience challenge with sleep.\\n\\nNobody is perfect about sleep.\\n\\nThat's important to keep in mind.\\n\\nI think a good goal is to get enough quality sleep\\n\\nof sufficient duration, 80% of the nights of your life,\\n\\nand then as much as possible to make sure\\n\\nthat the remaining 20% of nights,\\n\\nyou're not getting enough sleep for good reasons,\\n\\nas opposed to hard reasons.\\n\\nGood reasons would include raising children.\\n\\nThat's important.\\n\\nAfter all, every species desires to make more of itself\\n\\nand to preserve and extend the wellbeing of its young.\\n\\nSo child rearing is a perfectly legitimate reason\\n\\nto get a lack of sleep,\\n\\nbut you really want to strive to get quality sleep\\n\\nmost nights of your life,\\n\\nwhich means that even if you're somebody\\n\\nwho can quote unquote drink an espresso\\n\\nand then fall right asleep,\\n\\nthat you avoid caffeine intake\\n\\nin the 12 hours prior to sleep.\\n\\nI realize not everyone will be able to do that.\\n\\nIn fact, I sometimes violate that.\\n\\nSo I tend to go to sleep around 10 p.m. every night,\\n\\nsometimes 11, occasionally 12 midnight,\\n\\nbut usually around 10 p.m. every night.\\n\\nI confess that my last ingestion of caffeine\\n\\nis not always 10 a.m. or prior to that.\\n\\nSo sometimes I will have caffeine up until 11 a.m.\\n\\nor maybe noon, and very, very rarely I'll have an afternoon\\n\\ncoffee or espresso or non calorie containing soda\\n\\nor tea or something of that sort.\\n\\nBut I really try to restrict my caffeine intake\\n\\nto the early part of my day, that is before noon,\\n\\ngiven that I go to sleep around 10 p.m. each night.\\n\\nAnd I strongly encourage everyone out there\\n\\nto try and limit their afternoon caffeine intake.\\n\\nThis is something that Dr. Matt Walker,\\n\\nwho's an expert sleep researcher\\n\\nout of University of California, Berkeley,\\n\\npsychology and neuroscience department there,\\n\\nauthor of the incredible book, Why We Sleep.\\n\\nHe's been on this podcast, many other podcasts\\n\\ntalking about the importance of sleep.\\n\\nHe will remind us, and I'll remind you now,\\n\\nthat the quarter life of caffeine is 12 hours.\\n\\nI mentioned this earlier, but I'm going to repeat it again.\\n\\nAnd that means that if you ingest caffeine at noon,\\n\\n25% of its effects, more or less, okay,\\n\\nI'm using broad stroke here to talk about quarter life,\\n\\n25% of that is still going to be bioactive\\n\\nat midnight that night,\\n\\nwhich will disrupt the early phase of your night,\\n\\nthe amount of slow wave sleep,\\n\\nwhich then in turn will disrupt\\n\\nthe amount of rapid eye movement sleep,\\n\\nwhich will disrupt your emotional processing\\n\\nduring the following day and so on and so forth, okay?\\n\\nNone of this is to say that if you have the occasional\\n\\ncup of coffee in the afternoon,\\n\\nthat's going to completely demolish\\n\\nyour sleep wake cycle forever.\\n\\nBut I really encourage people to avoid drinking caffeine\\n\\nin the 12 hours prior to sleep.\\n\\nAnd if you can't do that within the 10 hours\\n\\nprior to sleep, and if you can't do that\\n\\nwithin the eight hours prior to sleep,\\n\\nso really try and limit your caffeine intake\\n\\nin the eight to 12 hours prior to going to sleep at night.\\n\\nAnd of course, slow wave sleep, AKA deep sleep,\\n\\nis the sleep that's associated\\n\\nwith somewhat mundane dreams,\\n\\nwhich makes it sound like it might not be that important,\\n\\nbut it's also the sleep that's associated\\n\\nwith growth hormone release,\\n\\nwhich is important for protein synthesis,\\n\\nrepair of all bodily tissues and metabolism,\\n\\nand slow wave sleep is also critically attached\\n\\nto your immune system's ability\\n\\nto clear out bacteria and viruses\\n\\nthat might otherwise infect your tissues.\\n\\nNow I'd like to talk about caffeine and performance,\\n\\nand that includes both mental performance\\n\\nand physical performance.\\n\\nNow I'd like to talk about caffeine\\n\\nand its positive effects on performance when used correctly.\\n\\nAnd here we are referring to both mental performance\\n\\nand physical performance.\\n\\nThe exploration of caffeine as a pro-performance tool\\n\\nhas been explored since the 1930s,\\n\\nat least that's some of the earliest\\n\\ndocumented literature on this.\\n\\nAlthough I have to imagine,\\n\\ngiven that people have been using caffeine\\n\\nfor much longer than that,\\n\\nthat long ago somebody realized\\n\\nthat by ingesting a certain plant,\\n\\nthat they felt much more alertness\\n\\nand were able to hunt and gather\\n\\nor do any number of different things better,\\n\\nand as a consequence,\\n\\ndecided to consume more of that plant.\\n\\nNow, these days we consume a lot of caffeine\\n\\nin the form of coffee and tea mainly,\\n\\nand some people consume it in the form of caffeine tablets\\n\\nor energy drinks, et cetera.\\n\\nAcross the board, one finds that caffeine intake\\n\\nat a level of one to three milligrams per kilogram\\n\\nof body weight improves reaction time.\\n\\nThat is, it reduces the amount of time\\n\\nto take a physical action\\n\\nor to answer a question correctly\\n\\nwith a verbal response.\\n\\nIt can also improve coordination,\\n\\nit can also improve memory,\\n\\nalthough I do want to mention that\\n\\nwhereas most studies of the effects of caffeine\\n\\non improving mental and physical performance\\n\\ninvolve taking caffeine at one to three milligrams\\n\\nper kilogram of body weight\\n\\nbefore the mental task or physical task,\\n\\nthere is also a pro-performance effect of caffeine on memory\\n\\nif one takes caffeine after learning certain material,\\n\\nor I should say being exposed to certain material.\\n\\nWe'll come back to that in a few minutes.\\n\\nIf one examines reaction time, mood, alertness,\\n\\nfocus and memory,\\n\\nor the ability to call up information from memory\\n\\nor physical dexterity, power output, endurance,\\n\\nand overall feelings of wellbeing\\n\\nduring exercise and exertion,\\n\\ncaffeine has been shown in numerous studies\\n\\nin both men and women\\n\\nto improve all of those metrics significantly.\\n\\nSo this is all just to say that caffeine\\n\\nis an incredible performance enhancing tool.\\n\\nNow, what's not obvious from the statement\\n\\nthat caffeine is a performance enhancing tool\\n\\nacross the board and in men and women\\n\\nand in different contexts\\n\\nis that the way in which caffeine is taken\\n\\nis very important.\\n\\nBecause 90% or more of adults consume caffeine,\\n\\nfinding controls for studies of caffeine\\n\\nis really challenging.\\n\\nThat is finding people who don't ingest caffeine regularly\\n\\nis a very challenging task for the researcher.\\n\\nAnd as a consequence,\\n\\nmany of the studies of caffeine on human beings\\n\\ninvolve depriving regular caffeine users of caffeine\\n\\nand then examining the effects of caffeine\\n\\ngiven after a period of say five to 15 days of abstinence\\n\\nin a person that is essentially experiencing\\n\\nmild withdrawal symptoms\\n\\nbecause they haven't had the caffeine\\n\\nthat they were used to getting.\\n\\nSo this is an important point.\\n\\nAnd it's a point that likely exacerbates\\n\\nthe observed pro-performance effects of caffeine.\\n\\nNow, all of that isn't necessarily a problem\\n\\nprovided you keep it in mind.\\n\\nAnd it actually points to a way in which\\n\\neven if you're a regular caffeine user,\\n\\nyou can extract more of the benefits of caffeine.\\n\\nThe simplest way to do this, for instance,\\n\\nis to look back to what we talked about earlier\\n\\nin terms of the need to have\\n\\nmost of your cortisol increase restricted\\n\\nto the hour or hours just after waking\\n\\nin terms of mood and alertness and performance.\\n\\nOne of the ways to increase the peak of that cortisol\\n\\nearly in the day is to consume caffeine\\n\\nshortly after that peak occurs.\\n\\nAnd this was really nicely demonstrated\\n\\nin a study entitled caffeine stimulation\\n\\nof cortisol secretion across the waking hours\\n\\nin relation to caffeine intake levels.\\n\\nWe will provide a link to this study.\\n\\nIt's a somewhat complicated study\\n\\nbecause they looked at a bunch of different\\n\\ntimes of day for caffeine intake.\\n\\nAnd I should mention this study,\\n\\nthey use this 300 milligrams per day\\n\\nor 600 milligrams per day.\\n\\nSo that's quite high,\\n\\nalthough for people of sufficient body weight\\n\\nand who are accustomed to taking caffeine,\\n\\nit's certainly not going to be in excess\\n\\nof what a lot of people out there are taking.\\n\\nBut basically what they observed was the following.\\n\\nCortisol responses to caffeine are reduced,\\n\\nbut not eliminated in people who consume caffeine\\n\\non a daily basis.\\n\\nWhat this means is that if you wake up\\n\\nand as I recommended earlier,\\n\\nyou avoid drinking caffeine for the first 90\\n\\nto 120 minutes after waking,\\n\\nbut you do get some sunlight\\n\\nor other bright light in your eyes in that time,\\n\\nmaybe even get some exercise in that time,\\n\\nwhich would be even better.\\n\\nAnd then you ingest caffeine,\\n\\nyou will get a further increase in cortisol,\\n\\nwhich provided it's restricted to the early part of the day\\n\\nis a good thing overall for mood and alertness.\\n\\nSo this is a simple performance enhancing tool,\\n\\nwhich is to stack caffeine on the tail\\n\\nof that early cortisol peak.\\n\\nI should also mention, however, that in this study,\\n\\nthey had people do a five-day caffeine abstinence\\n\\nprior to being tested with 300 milligrams\\n\\nor 600 milligrams of caffeine.\\n\\nSo the simple tool to extract from this\\n\\nand other studies like it,\\n\\nis that if you want to experience\\n\\nthe maximum alertness promoting effects of caffeine,\\n\\nwhen you ingest it early in the day,\\n\\nyou would abstain from caffeine for five days\\n\\nand then ingest caffeine 90 to 120 minutes after waking.\\n\\nI would still hope that you were doing all the other things\\n\\nthat I described, morning, sunlight, exercise,\\n\\net cetera, correctly,\\n\\nbut regardless, it's very clear\\n\\nthat a five-day abstinence from caffeine,\\n\\nhowever painful that might be,\\n\\nwill increase the performance enhancing effects of caffeine\\n\\nwhen you take caffeine on that sixth day.\\n\\nNow, I'm sure many of you out there are saying,\\n\\nwhy would I ever want to abstain from caffeine\\n\\nfor five days in order to just get this six-day\\n\\nperformance enhancing effect?\\n\\nWell, there are a couple of reasons for doing that.\\n\\nPerhaps you're planning to travel to a new time zone\\n\\nand you want to use caffeine as a stimulant\\n\\nto stay up during the day in the new time zone.\\n\\nThat's a somewhat unusual case.\\n\\nOthers of you might be interested\\n\\nin the pro-physical performance effects of caffeine.\\n\\nWe'll talk more about these in a little bit,\\n\\nbut you want to get the maximum strength increase\\n\\nor the maximum endurance increase from ingesting,\\n\\nin this case, 300 to 600 milligrams of caffeine.\\n\\nWell, in that case, abstaining from caffeine for five days\\n\\nwill greatly exacerbate the pro-performance effects\\n\\nof caffeine when you take it on that sixth day.\\n\\nAlthough, admittedly, those five days\\n\\nare likely to be pretty painful\\n\\nif you're a regular caffeine user.\\n\\nAnother variation on this, however,\\n\\nmight be to have the amount of caffeine\\n\\nthat you ingest on a daily basis\\n\\nand then go back to your regular level of caffeine intake\\n\\non that day in which you need the caffeine\\n\\nto really boost your mood, energy, and performance.\\n\\nAnother reason why you might want to abstain from caffeine\\n\\nor reduce your caffeine intake for a period of time\\n\\nand then go back to your regular caffeine intake\\n\\nis simply to identify how much of an effect\\n\\ncaffeine is really having on your overall level\\n\\nof daily functioning and mood.\\n\\nThis was something that was actually covered\\n\\nin beautiful detail in a book by Michael Pollan,\\n\\nAll About Caffeine.\\n\\nIt's available on Audible.\\n\\nI really enjoyed that book.\\n\\nIt describes his experience with the decision\\n\\nto completely abstain from caffeine for a period of months.\\n\\nAlthough, I confess that after hearing that book,\\n\\nwhat it basically made me want to do\\n\\nis never quit drinking caffeine\\n\\nbecause it sounded as if, at least my interpretation was,\\n\\nthat even after several weeks or months\\n\\nof abstaining from caffeine,\\n\\nthat he still fantasized about the effects of caffeine.\\n\\nBut he did mention that when returning to ingesting caffeine\\n\\nafter a period of long abstinence,\\n\\nthat it had almost a,\\n\\nlet's not call it a psychedelic property,\\n\\nbut it had such obvious effects on mood and alertness\\n\\nand feelings of wellbeing\\n\\nthat it really highlighted for him\\n\\nthe extent to which caffeine normally was allowing him\\n\\nto just function what he thought was normally.\\n\\nSo in other words, many of us don't even really know\\n\\nwhat our normal basal level of cognitive\\n\\nand physical functioning is\\n\\nbecause we're ingesting caffeine on such a regular basis.\\n\\nI confess that as much as I enjoyed that book\\n\\nand as intriguing as his description of caffeine abstinence\\n\\nand then the return to caffeine was,\\n\\nI don't intend to ever find out personally.\\n\\nNow, a very good reason why you might want to abstain\\n\\nfrom caffeine for a deliberate period of time\\n\\nand then return to caffeine intake\\n\\nis for its physical performance enhancing effects.\\n\\nAnd here we can look to a really interesting study,\\n\\ntitle of which is Time Course of Tolerance\\n\\nto the Performance Effects of Caffeine.\\n\\nAnd what I like about this study is that while yes,\\n\\nit does say that abstaining from caffeine\\n\\nand then returning to caffeine intake\\n\\ncan enhance physical performance in a very specific way.\\n\\nIt also says that if you take caffeine regularly,\\n\\nyou can still see the physical performance\\n\\nenhancing effects of caffeine,\\n\\nalthough they are not quite as robust\\n\\nas they would be had you abstained from caffeine.\\n\\nThe design of the study is pretty straightforward.\\n\\nThey had people either ingest three milligrams\\n\\nper kilogram of caffeine for 20 consecutive days.\\n\\nMany people are already doing that, I realize,\\n\\nbut they had people do that\\n\\nor ensure that they were doing that\\n\\nor others ingested a placebo for 20 days.\\n\\nSo they abstained from caffeine without realizing it.\\n\\nThen after that 20 days\\n\\nof either ingesting caffeine or a placebo,\\n\\ntheir peak performance was measured\\n\\nin terms of aerobic output,\\n\\nbut prior to that measurement, they had caffeine, okay?\\n\\nSo it's 20 days of caffeine and then a 21st day of caffeine\\n\\nand then the physical task on that 21st day,\\n\\nor it's 20 days of abstinence from caffeine.\\n\\nAnd then on day 21, you get caffeine\\n\\nand you get the same physical test.\\n\\nAnd what they discovered was that the ingestion of caffeine\\n\\nincreased peak performance in this aerobic output\\n\\ndramatically if people had abstained from caffeine,\\n\\nbut for people that had consumed caffeine\\n\\nall the way through up until that day,\\n\\nit still was effective to ingest caffeine on day 21,\\n\\nbut not as effective as it would have been\\n\\nhad they abstained.\\n\\nAnd in fact, the magnitude of the,\\n\\nwhat they call ergogenic effect,\\n\\nwhich is the pro-performance enhancing effect of caffeine\\n\\nwas higher on the first day than in subsequent days\\n\\nwhen they allowed people to continue caffeine intake.\\n\\nSo the takeaway from this study is really straightforward.\\n\\nIf you want to get the maximum physical performance\\n\\nenhancing effects of caffeine,\\n\\nyou abstain from caffeine for 20 days.\\n\\nThen on day 21, when you're going to do the physical thing,\\n\\nthe task, you ingest caffeine about 30 minutes\\n\\nto an hour before you do that physical challenge.\\n\\nNow, 20 days of abstinence is going to be rough\\n\\nfor a lot of people.\\n\\nThey certainly don't want to sign up for this study,\\n\\nin which case you might want to do five days of abstinence\\n\\nas we talked about before.\\n\\nAnd then on day six is the day that you ingest caffeine\\n\\nand do the physical task.\\n\\nThere are even some studies showing\\n\\nthat you can abstain from caffeine for just two days,\\n\\nfor just 48 hours.\\n\\nAnd in particular, if you are a regular user of caffeine,\\n\\nthis allows you to on day three,\\n\\ningest caffeine at the dose that's appropriate for you\\n\\nand do the physical or I should mention\\n\\nmental performance task and perform significantly better\\n\\nthan those that have been taking caffeine\\n\\nthroughout the entire period leading up to the challenge.\\n\\nSo you don't necessarily need to abstain for 20 days\\n\\nin order to get the pro performance effects\\n\\nof caffeine on day 21.\\n\\nYou could do five days of abstinence prior\\n\\nor even two days of abstinence prior.\\n\\nOr if that's intolerable to you,\\n\\nas it is in my mind to me,\\n\\nto just reduce your caffeine intake slightly\\n\\nor even perhaps have it, if you can tolerate that\\n\\nin the week or two weeks or maybe even three weeks\\n\\nproceeding some physical or mental challenge.\\n\\nNow, again, this sort of implies\\n\\nthat you're going up against a marathon\\n\\nor you're going up against a series of long tests,\\n\\nmaybe standardized tests in one day.\\n\\nThere, I just really want to point out\\n\\nthat there is an abundant literature showing\\n\\nthat people perform best on mental tests\\n\\nif they are in the state that they were\\n\\nwhen they studied for that material.\\n\\nNow in college, I knew a number of people\\n\\nwho took this to the extreme thinking\\n\\nthat if they were to study under the effects of alcohol\\n\\nthat they would be best off consuming alcohol\\n\\nprior to taking exams.\\n\\nAnd it turns out to not be the case.\\n\\nHere, we're talking in particular\\n\\nabout psychostimulant effects of caffeine\\n\\nand other compounds.\\n\\nSo don't think that you can drink\\n\\nor be under the influence of THC\\n\\nand then take when you study and then take an exam\\n\\nunder the same influence and do just as well as you would\\n\\nhad you not ingested anything.\\n\\nPlease don't let that be the takeaway.\\n\\nHowever, do let it be the takeaway\\n\\nthat caffeine's effects are made more potent\\n\\nby a brief to not so brief period of abstinence\\n\\nprior to taking a dosage of caffeine.\\n\\nAnd then the final point to make\\n\\nis that if you are somebody who is not accustomed\\n\\nto drinking caffeine, meaning you're hypersensitive to caffeine\\n\\nor you don't regularly ingest caffeine,\\n\\nplease do not ingest caffeine on the day\\n\\nof any important mental or physical challenge\\n\\nor performance because what you will find\\n\\nis that because you are not caffeine adapted,\\n\\nyou will experience changes in your thermal regulation,\\n\\nin your levels of anxiety and jitteriness\\n\\nand your levels of focus that could be very detrimental\\n\\nto mental or physical performance.\\n\\nSo you don't want to throw yourself in the deep end\\n\\nby ingesting caffeine if you're not used to it.\\n\\nAnd I should mention that for people\\n\\nthat are not accustomed to ingesting caffeine\\n\\nor are very sensitive to caffeine,\\n\\neven 25 to 50 milligrams of caffeine\\n\\nin the amount that's found in, for instance,\\n\\na piece of certain types of chocolate\\n\\ncan actually cause anxiety.\\n\\nSo be careful there.\\n\\nHere I'm referring only to people\\n\\nthat are accustomed with caffeine intake.\\n\\nSo what I recommend is to explore\\n\\nthe ergogenic effects of caffeine during your training\\n\\nand then to make a decision about what you can reasonably\\n\\nand reliably do in terms of abstinence\\n\\nand then pulse with caffeine on the day of the challenge.\\n\\nI get a lot of questions as to whether or not caffeine\\n\\nhas different effects on the nervous system\\n\\nand on performance in particular,\\n\\ndepending on phases of the menstrual cycle.\\n\\nSo I explored that in my research for this episode\\n\\nand I found two studies,\\n\\nboth of which we will reference in the show note captions.\\n\\nThe first one is entitled\\n\\nCaffeine Consumption and Menstrual Function.\\n\\nSo it's actually the relationship\\n\\nbetween caffeine and menstrual function.\\n\\nWe will do an entire episode\\n\\nabout the menstrual cycle and menstrual function.\\n\\nBut the other one, as it relates to performance,\\n\\nwas published in 2020 in the European Journal of Nutrition,\\n\\nwhich is Ergogenic Effects of Caffeine\\n\\non Picarobic Cycling Power During the Menstrual Cycle.\\n\\nAnd the basic takeaway of this study,\\n\\nthis is frankly a very nice study,\\n\\nshowed that, quote,\\n\\ncaffeine increased peak aerobic cycling power\\n\\nin the early follicular, pre-ovulatory,\\n\\nand mid-luteal phases of the menstrual cycle.\\n\\nThus the ingestion, and again here,\\n\\nthey use three milligrams of caffeine\\n\\nper kilogram of body mass,\\n\\nmight be considered an ergogenic aid\\n\\nfor women who are in the menstrual cycle\\n\\nduring all three phases of their cycle.\\n\\nSo keep that in mind, women,\\n\\nfor those of you that are regular users of caffeine\\n\\nor you're using caffeine to enhance physical performance,\\n\\nthere does not seem to be any menstrual cycle\\n\\nphase-dependent effects of caffeine on performance.\\n\\nThat is, caffeine seems to always increase\\n\\nphysical performance,\\n\\nregardless of the phase of the menstrual cycle\\n\\nyou might happen to be in.\\n\\nI'd like to touch on a little bit more\\n\\nof the use of caffeine for enhancing mental performance.\\n\\nYes, it is the case that ingesting\\n\\none to three milligrams of caffeine\\n\\nper kilogram of body weight\\n\\nin the 30 minutes or so prior to doing a memory task\\n\\nor sitting down to doing some studying\\n\\nor learning of any kind,\\n\\nphysical or mental performance of any kind,\\n\\nis beneficial for all the reasons we talked about before\\n\\nrelated to dopamine and acetylcholine, et cetera.\\n\\nBut it turns out that it is also the case\\n\\nthat spiking one's adrenaline\\n\\nand other so-called catecholamines,\\n\\nso this would be dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine,\\n\\nafter a bout of learning,\\n\\ncan greatly enhance memory for the information\\n\\nthat one was trying to learn.\\n\\nThat's right.\\n\\nSpiking your adrenaline after learning\\n\\ncan greatly increase memory\\n\\nfor the material you're trying to learn.\\n\\nIn fact, this is a practice that dates back centuries\\n\\nand was written about in a beautiful annual review\\n\\nof neuroscience on the biology of memory by James McGaugh,\\n\\nwhere he talks about medieval practices\\n\\nof children being taught information\\n\\nand then being thrown literally into cold water\\n\\nto stimulate the release of adrenaline.\\n\\nAnd that increase in adrenaline,\\n\\nwhile the mechanism wasn't completely understood,\\n\\nit was understood that that sort of shock to the system\\n\\nfrom the cold water led to better memory\\n\\nand retention of the information\\n\\nthat these children had been exposed to.\\n\\nAnd it turns out the exact same thing is true for adults\\n\\nin the laboratory or kids in the laboratory.\\n\\nAnd here I'm not suggesting throwing anyone into cold water.\\n\\nIf you want to get into cold water,\\n\\nthere's a reason we call it deliberate cold exposure\\n\\non the podcast is that it should be deliberate\\n\\nand controlled by you, not by somebody else.\\n\\nIf it's controlled by somebody else,\\n\\nthat might be military screening or something.\\n\\nBut here we're talking about deliberately increasing\\n\\nyour levels of adrenaline and other catecholamines,\\n\\ndopamine, norepinephrine, et cetera.\\n\\nYou can do that certainly by deliberate cold exposure\\n\\nwith a cold shower or getting in up to your neck\\n\\nin cold water of any kind.\\n\\nBut the other way to do that is to spike your adrenaline\\n\\nby ingesting one to three milligrams per kilogram\\n\\nof caffeine after sitting down\\n\\nto try and learn some material.\\n\\nI confess that more often than not,\\n\\nI use caffeine the same way that most people use it,\\n\\nwhich is, okay, I'm going to sit down,\\n\\nI'm going to research information for a podcast\\n\\nor assemble some information for a paper or grant.\\n\\nAnd I want to focus, so I will drink a cup of coffee\\n\\nat the beginning of that and maybe even throughout that\\n\\nor a couple of yerba mate at the beginning\\n\\nor throughout that, or I'll sip on one or both\\n\\nthroughout trying to learn.\\n\\nAnd that works quite well in terms of maintaining focus\\n\\nand alertness and retention of information.\\n\\nBut it is indeed the case,\\n\\nthat is the research supports the fact,\\n\\nand I've experienced the fact that if I abstain\\n\\nfrom caffeine while I'm trying to learn something,\\n\\nbut then I drink caffeine immediately after.\\n\\nSomewhat surprisingly to me,\\n\\nbut certainly in a way that's consistent\\n\\nwith the research literature,\\n\\nmemory for the information that I was focused on\\n\\nprior to ingesting that caffeine is much greater.\\n\\nAnd here I'm talking about it as a personal anecdote,\\n\\nbut this is actually what the data point to\\n\\nboth in animals and in humans.\\n\\nAnd if you think about it, it makes perfect sense\\n\\nbecause the way that the memory systems\\n\\nof the brain are organized is that\\n\\nwe go through life experiencing things,\\n\\nwe encounter surprises, both good and bad.\\n\\nWe go through the motions of things,\\n\\nboth typical, mundane, exciting and novel and not novel.\\n\\nAnd then every once in a while,\\n\\nsomething will happen that will spike our catecholamines,\\n\\ndopamine, typically if it's a positive surprise,\\n\\nadrenaline, which can be associated\\n\\nwith both positive surprise or positive events\\n\\nand negative events or surprises.\\n\\nAnd without fail, increases in the catecholamines\\n\\ntend to lock in memories for things that preceded\\n\\nthe increase in those catecholamines.\\n\\nAgain, the catecholamines being dopamine,\\n\\nepinephrine and norepinephrine,\\n\\nsometimes all three in combination,\\n\\nsometimes just two of those,\\n\\nsometimes just one of those depending on the experience.\\n\\nSo it makes perfect sense that using caffeine\\n\\nat the end of a learning bout would enhance our memory\\n\\nfor the information that we're trying to learn.\\n\\nSo if you decide that you want to try\\n\\nand extract this performance enhancing effect of caffeine,\\n\\nwhat I recommend would be to try and abstain from caffeine\\n\\nfor a day or two prior.\\n\\nBut if you can't,\\n\\nto just continue with your normal caffeine intake.\\n\\nBut then when you sit down to study or learn something\\n\\nto not ingest any caffeine as you do that,\\n\\nbut then afterward to ingest caffeine.\\n\\nNow, in theory, you could probably further enhance\\n\\nthe memory encoding effects of adrenaline\\n\\nand the other catecholamines by drinking caffeine\\n\\nand then taking a cold shower,\\n\\ndoing deliberate cold exposure if you really wanted to\\n\\nor had the ability to,\\n\\nor doing some sort of intense form of exercise.\\n\\nAnd we'll talk in a moment about how caffeine exercise\\n\\nand the adrenaline system interact.\\n\\nBut as a brief but relevant aside,\\n\\nbrief bouts of intense exercise\\n\\nranging from 10 to 50 minutes or so\\n\\nhave been shown to improve memory for information\\n\\nthat one was trying to learn prior to the intense exercise.\\n\\nThis is work from Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab at NYU\\n\\nas well as other laboratories.\\n\\nSome of the work that's being done at Stanford\\n\\nin the mind body laboratories.\\n\\nAnd our laboratory points in the direction\\n\\nof these kinds of effects as well.\\n\\nThey all come back to the same general neurochemical theme,\\n\\nwhich is that when we experience an increase\\n\\nin these catecholamines that include adrenaline,\\n\\ndopamine and norepinephrine,\\n\\nthe memory systems of the brain flip on\\n\\nin a way that try to capture the information\\n\\nand the perceptions and the experiences\\n\\nthat we were exposed to just prior\\n\\nto the increase in catecholamines.\\n\\nAnd caffeine, but also exercise and also cold water.\\n\\nAnd of course, any of those alone or in combination\\n\\nall increase the levels of catecholamines.\\n\\nSo it makes perfect logical mechanistic sense\\n\\nas to why this would work.\\n\\nAnd in fact, it does work.\\n\\nIf you want to remember specific information,\\n\\nyou might consider using caffeine\\n\\nas you move through and absorb\\n\\nand are exposed to that information.\\n\\nBut you might also consider using caffeine\\n\\nafter being exposed to that information\\n\\nbecause studies in animals and humans show\\n\\nthat that is a potent way to increase memory\\n\\nfor what you were just exposed to.\\n\\nI should mention that what I just described\\n\\nalso pushes back on something that I know\\n\\na number of people perhaps have heard about\\n\\nand maybe even use, which is this notion of the nappuccino.\\n\\nI remember hearing about this a few years back.\\n\\nIt was a sort of trend, if you will.\\n\\nThe trend involved drinking a cup of coffee\\n\\nor double espresso and then going down for a nap,\\n\\ntypically in the afternoon and then waking up.\\n\\nAnd the idea was that the caffeine would hit your system\\n\\nright at the time that you awake from the nap\\n\\nand that you would be better able to focus and exercise.\\n\\nThere are a couple of things about that practice\\n\\nthat I don't like.\\n\\nFirst of all, it implies in most cases\\n\\nthat you're napping and ingesting caffeine\\n\\nin the afternoon, which I realize for many students\\n\\nand for people that are comfortable staying up\\n\\nuntil the wee hours of the night\\n\\nand then waking up late the next day\\n\\nmight be compatible with their schedule.\\n\\nBut again, because of the sleep diminishing effects\\n\\nof caffeine, and we talked about earlier,\\n\\nnot crazy about the idea of people ingesting caffeine\\n\\nin the late afternoon in order to perform better\\n\\nin the late afternoon, far better would be\\n\\nto restrict caffeine intake to the early part of the day\\n\\nas we talked about earlier.\\n\\nThe other reason is that the data on things\\n\\nlike non-sleep deep rest and naps in the afternoon.\\n\\nAnd again, the rule here is that you don't have to nap,\\n\\nbut if you want to nap, it's been shown that naps\\n\\nof 90 minutes or less or non-sleep deep rest protocols.\\n\\nAnd you can find those, for instance,\\n\\nthere's one with me speaking.\\n\\nYou just put NSDR Huberman into YouTube.\\n\\nYou can hear that it's completely zero cost.\\n\\nThere are other NSDR scripts out there now, of course,\\n\\nif you prefer those.\\n\\nThat those can all lead to increases\\n\\nin one of the catecholamines at least, which is dopamine.\\n\\nThat's been shown in a really nice neurotransmitter\\n\\nlabeling study, not from my laboratory,\\n\\nbut from another laboratory,\\n\\nbut also can improve mood focus and alertness on its own\\n\\nwithout the need to ingest caffeine prior\\n\\nto going into those states.\\n\\nAnd in fact, ingesting caffeine prior to a nap\\n\\nor ingesting caffeine prior to NSDR is most certainly\\n\\ngoing to reduce the effectiveness of that nap and NSDR\\n\\nin restoring natural levels of alertness and focus\\n\\nthat would lead to the performance enhancing effect.\\n\\nSo I'm not such a fan of the so-called nappuccino,\\n\\nalthough if any of you out there\\n\\nhave derived great benefit from it,\\n\\ndefinitely let me know your protocol\\n\\nand what you've experienced.\\n\\nPut it in the comment section if you would.\\n\\nI'd appreciate that.\\n\\nThere's another very important and potent use of caffeine\\n\\nfor enhancing performance.\\n\\nAnd this relates not just to the dopamine\\n\\nand epinephrine and the arousal inducing effects of caffeine.\\n\\nAnd it doesn't even just relate to the effect of caffeine\\n\\non enhancing frontal lobe function.\\n\\nIt does include all that,\\n\\nbut it also includes those reinforcing effects of caffeine\\n\\nthat we talked about at the beginning of the episode.\\n\\nAnd the best way to illustrate these performance enhancing\\n\\neffects of caffeine that stem directly\\n\\nfrom its association with reinforcement\\n\\nis to highlight a study.\\n\\nAnd the title of the study is blood dopamine level\\n\\nenhanced by caffeine in men after treadmill running.\\n\\nAnd as the title suggests, this was carried out in men,\\n\\nbut there's no reason to think that the same results\\n\\nwouldn't also be present in women.\\n\\nThere are some sex dependent effects of caffeine\\n\\nI'll touch on just briefly at the end,\\n\\nbut those are largely present in kids,\\n\\nthat is adolescents and teens as opposed to adults.\\n\\nSo this study is really interesting.\\n\\nWhat they had people do was run on a treadmill\\n\\nand either ingest caffeine again,\\n\\nthree milligrams per kilogram of body weight\\n\\nor to not ingest caffeine.\\n\\nAnd then they looked at levels of dopamine\\n\\nand other neurotransmitters and hormones\\n\\nsuch as prolactin and cortisol.\\n\\nAnd the basic takeaway is as the title suggests\\n\\nthat exercise while on its own can increase cortisol\\n\\nin healthy ways, provided it's not too intense and too long.\\n\\nLittle note here, if you have trouble recovering\\n\\nfrom exercise or you want to continue to derive\\n\\nthe benefits from exercise in general,\\n\\nbest not to do high intensity exercise\\n\\nfor longer than 75 minutes or 90 minutes\\n\\nonly being the outer threshold.\\n\\nI realize that there are some genetic freaks out there\\n\\nor people that are chemically assisted that can recover\\n\\nfrom very intense long bouts of exercise,\\n\\nbut most people don't do well long bouts of intense exercise\\n\\non a regular basis and limiting their intense exercise\\n\\nto 60 minutes or less.\\n\\nThat doesn't include the warmup is going to be beneficial.\\n\\nSee the episode on a toolkit for fitness\\n\\nif you'd like details on that.\\n\\nExercise is known to increase levels of dopamine,\\n\\ncortisol and other catecholamines\\n\\nand neurotransmitters very potently\\n\\nand things like testosterone and estrogen\\n\\nin ways that we know are beneficial to us.\\n\\nAnd of course have all these positive effects\\n\\non the musculoskeletal system and cardiovascular effects.\\n\\nBut unbeknownst to most people ingesting\\n\\nthree milligrams per kilogram of caffeine prior to exercise\\n\\nfurther increases the dopamine release associated\\n\\nwith exercise specifically.\\n\\nAnd this has two important effects.\\n\\nFirst of all, that increase in dopamine is great\\n\\nbecause it provides a long lasting increase\\n\\nin focus alertness and motivation,\\n\\nnot just during the exercise, but also after the exercise.\\n\\nAnd second, it that is caffeine and dopamine in combination\\n\\nact as a reinforcer to make the experience of exercise\\n\\nand the period immediate after exercise more pleasant\\n\\nand in fact reinforcing.\\n\\nSo in other words, one way to enjoy exercise more\\n\\nand to enjoy the activities that follow exercise more\\n\\nand to experience a genuine increase in dopamine\\n\\nthat's beneficial for mood and alertness\\n\\nis to ingest caffeine prior to exercise.\\n\\nNow, this is important because a number of people out there\\n\\nare exercising, love exercise, love eating great,\\n\\nlove doing all the things that are beneficial\\n\\nfor their health.\\n\\nBut a number of people out there\\n\\nreally don't like to exercise.\\n\\nAnd that serves as a serious block for their willingness\\n\\nand their consistency to exercise.\\n\\nIngesting caffeine gives us energy to exercise.\\n\\nIt increases the release of neurochemicals and hormones\\n\\nthat are good for us during exercise.\\n\\nBut as I'm highlighting here,\\n\\nit also increases the reinforcement pathways\\n\\nassociated with exercise.\\n\\nThat is it creates a positive feeling\\n\\nabout the general theme of engaging in exercise\\n\\nand it creates a general positive experience\\n\\nof the things that follow exercise.\\n\\nSo I think this, if nothing else is a call for\\n\\nor support for the idea that ingesting caffeine\\n\\nas a performance enhancing tool makes perfect sense.\\n\\nBut for those out there that don't enjoy exercise\\n\\nin particular, certain forms of exercise,\\n\\ningesting caffeine can change your relationship\\n\\nto that exercise.\\n\\nIn other words, make it more positive\\n\\nmuch in the same way that ingesting caffeine\\n\\nalongside a certain taste that would otherwise be neutral\\n\\nor maybe even negative can actually make the taste\\n\\nof that particular drink or food positive.\\n\\nSo again, this brings us back\\n\\nto the reinforcing properties of caffeine\\n\\nthat are subconscious.\\n\\nIt's not just about the enhanced performance in the test\\n\\nor the enhanced performance on the treadmill\\n\\nor with the weights in the gym.\\n\\nIt's enhanced feelings of mood and wellbeing\\n\\nthat are genuine because of the effect of caffeine\\n\\non certain neurotransmitter and hormone systems.\\n\\nBut it also is creating an overall milieu\\n\\nof reinforcing all of the things that led into,\\n\\noccur during and occur after exercise.\\n\\nI do want to point out something that's very important\\n\\nas it relates to combining things like caffeine\\n\\nand exercise in order to increase dopamine.\\n\\nThis is something that came up in the episode that I did\\n\\non dopamine motivation and drive,\\n\\nwhich turns out to be one of our most popular episodes.\\n\\nAgain, you can find that at hubermanlab.com\\n\\nand links to all formats with timestamps, et cetera.\\n\\nThis also came up in the episode on ADHD\\n\\nbecause of the relationship between ADHD and dopamine.\\n\\nAnd that's this notion of dopamine stacking.\\n\\nIn the episode on dopamine motivation and drive,\\n\\nI pointed out that while there are a near infinite number\\n\\nof things that can increase dopamine release,\\n\\nmost notably positive surprise or positive anticipation\\n\\nor experiencing a win, certainly there are compounds,\\n\\nboth drugs of abuse, food, sex and certain supplements\\n\\nthat can increase dopamine to varying levels\\n\\nand to varying degrees, both healthy and unhealthy.\\n\\nThat's all contained in that episode\\n\\non dopamine motivation and drive.\\n\\nBut what I pointed out is that if you are somebody\\n\\nwho tends to experience difficulty with motivation,\\n\\nthat so-called dopamine stacking, as I called it,\\n\\nmight be something that you want to avoid.\\n\\nWhat is dopamine stacking?\\n\\nDopamine stacking would be combining\\n\\na highly caffeinated energy drink\\n\\nthat also includes the amino acid tyrosine,\\n\\nwhich is a precursor to dopamine, plus loud music,\\n\\nplus getting yourself really ramped up\\n\\nthan an intense workout.\\n\\nAll of that can be great if you do it every once in a while,\\n\\nbut what you will quickly find is that\\n\\nthe extent to which your dopamine peaks\\n\\nalso dictates the extent to which your dopamine\\n\\nwill drop after that peak.\\n\\nAnd when I say drop, I mean drop below baseline.\\n\\nSo a lot of people find that they stack a lot of things\\n\\nto peak their dopamine, then they experience a low\\n\\nand it does take some time for them to return to baseline.\\n\\nAnd I highly recommend not engaging in activities\\n\\nor consuming compounds that are in attempt\\n\\nto accelerate that return to baseline\\n\\nbecause all it will do is drive that baseline lower and lower.\\n\\nSo this requires being able to tolerate a drop\\n\\nin dopamine baseline for a period of time, et cetera.\\n\\nNow, the reason I'm bringing this up now\\n\\nin the context of this caffeine episode\\n\\nis I just described a study in which using caffeine\\n\\nprior to exercise increases dopamine after exercise.\\n\\nAnd so you might be saying,\\n\\nespecially if you heard that earlier episode,\\n\\nwait, isn't that dopamine stacking?\\n\\nAren't you encouraging me to stack my dopamine?\\n\\nWell, in some sense, yes, but keep in mind,\\n\\nI'm not suggesting that you do this every time you exercise.\\n\\nSo just as in that earlier episode,\\n\\nI emphasized the fact that while stacking multiple stimuli,\\n\\nright, caffeine or energy drinks and music and et cetera,\\n\\nfor exercise or for mental work or for any experience\\n\\nfor that matter is okay to do every once in a while\\n\\nfor most people, you don't want to get in the habit\\n\\nof doing it consistently every time you exercise\\n\\nor every time you go out, for instance.\\n\\nAnd so you really want to be cautious.\\n\\nThat is you want to protect your both baseline levels\\n\\nof dopamine and your peak levels of dopamine.\\n\\nThat said, for people that want to experience an increase\\n\\nin mood alertness and performance,\\n\\nor who want to condition themselves\\n\\nbecause that's really what it is.\\n\\nIt's conditioning yourself\\n\\nby the reinforcing effects of dopamine\\n\\nto increase your liking,\\n\\nor maybe even your loving of exercise,\\n\\noccasionally using caffeine\\n\\nor frequently using caffeine prior to exercise is fine,\\n\\nbut be very careful.\\n\\nAnd by being very careful, what I mean is pay attention\\n\\nto how you feel in the hours and days\\n\\nafter that dopamine increase wears off.\\n\\nSo for instance, if you ingest caffeine\\n\\nand then exercise very intensely\\n\\nand you're feeling great afterwards,\\n\\nbut then eight hours later or the next day,\\n\\nyou're feeling a little bit low,\\n\\nI suggest you don't go back\\n\\nand do the exact same thing right away.\\n\\nI would give yourself a little bit of time\\n\\nto let that baseline of dopamine return to normal.\\n\\nSo again, stacking different things,\\n\\nchemical and behavioral in order to increase dopamine\\n\\ncan be done in a safe way that's beneficial to you\\n\\ndepending on your goals,\\n\\nbut be careful about not stacking too many stimuli\\n\\nfor dopamine too often.\\n\\nThat's the key.\\n\\nEarly in the episode,\\n\\nI mentioned one possible caffeine consuming schedule\\n\\nthat works very well,\\n\\nthat doesn't fortunately subject you to long 20 day bouts\\n\\nor five day or even two day bouts of abstinence.\\n\\nAnd that's the every other day schedule of caffeine.\\n\\nIf you look at the half life of caffeine\\n\\nand you look at its effects on the dopamine system\\n\\nand its performance enhancing effects\\n\\nand how a period of abstinence can in fact,\\n\\nincrease the performance enhancing effects of caffeine,\\n\\nbut also take into consideration\\n\\nthat caffeine can be habit forming\\n\\nand we can develop a sort of tolerance to caffeine.\\n\\nWell, then what emerges from all of that\\n\\nis that being a person who consumes caffeine\\n\\nevery other day can actually help you maximize\\n\\nmost of the positive effects of caffeine\\n\\nwithout subjecting you to the kind of misery that occurs\\n\\nif you're accustomed to consuming caffeine every single day\\n\\nand then suddenly go into a two or five\\n\\nor 20 day abstinence.\\n\\nSo I myself have never tried\\n\\nan every other day caffeine approach.\\n\\nAlthough I'm considering doing it based on the literature\\n\\nthat I've read and I'm considering doing it\\n\\nin a very specific way,\\n\\nwhich would be to only consume caffeine on the days\\n\\nin which I resistance train.\\n\\nAnd since I tend to do that about three or four days\\n\\nper week, organized in a way that's every other day.\\n\\nAgain, if you want to see the exercise schedule\\n\\nthat I follow, including cardiovascular exercise\\n\\nand weight training and all the reasons and rationale\\n\\nfor what I do and how it maps onto the scientific literature\\n\\nrelated to health span and life span, vitality, et cetera,\\n\\nyou can find that at hubermanlab.com\\n\\nand we had a toolkit for fitness\\n\\nthat ought to be posted to our website before long.\\n\\nThe every other day schedule of caffeine intake to me\\n\\nseems like the most rational one\\n\\nif one wants to maximize on the performance enhancing effects\\n\\nof caffeine without suffering the effects\\n\\nof caffeine withdrawal that are associated\\n\\nwith being a regular consumer of caffeine\\n\\nand then stopping caffeine intake such as headache\\n\\nand irritability and so forth.\\n\\nNot I nor anyone in my life wants me\\n\\nto experience those effects.\\n\\nAnd I'm sure you don't want to experience\\n\\nthose effects for you either.\\n\\nSo if you're somebody that decides\\n\\nto try the every other day protocol\\n\\nor you are somebody who's already doing that protocol,\\n\\nplease let me know what your experiences with that are.\\n\\nAt least by my read of the literature on caffeine\\n\\nand its performance enhancing effects,\\n\\nbut also the effects of caffeine\\n\\non neurotransmitter and hormone systems,\\n\\nthe every other day caffeine schedule\\n\\ndoes seem to be the most rational\\n\\nand scientifically grounded one\\n\\nin order to maximize on all those effects.\\n\\nIn addition to so-called performance enhancing effects\\n\\nof caffeine, there are also the well-studied\\n\\nand now fairly well mechanistically understood\\n\\npro-health effects of caffeine.\\n\\nNow here, when I talk about pro-health effects of caffeine,\\n\\nI want to be very clear that if your schedule\\n\\nof caffeine intake, that is your timing of caffeine intake\\n\\nor anything else for that matter,\\n\\noffsets getting regular high quality sleep\\n\\nof sufficient duration,\\n\\nwell, then you are undermining\\n\\nthe pro-health effects of that thing.\\n\\nThis is true for exercise, this is true for caffeine,\\n\\nthis is true for supplementation,\\n\\nthis is true for prescription drugs.\\n\\nAgain, you don't want to be neurotically attached\\n\\nto the idea that you have to get perfect sleep every night\\n\\nbecause that's simply not true,\\n\\nbut is absolutely the case that anything,\\n\\nwhether or not it's good for you or bad for you\\n\\nin the short term that disrupts your sleep\\n\\nbecause of the timing in which you're doing that thing\\n\\nis going to undermine your immediate\\n\\nand long-term health before long.\\n\\nSo with that said, there are several well-described\\n\\nhealth promoting effects of caffeine ingestion.\\n\\nAnd once again, when I say caffeine ingestion,\\n\\nI'm referring to that one to three milligrams\\n\\nper kilogram of body weight dosage.\\n\\nThere are really nice studies showing that\\n\\nbeing a regular consumer of caffeine\\n\\ncan help offset some of the probability,\\n\\nsome of the probability of developing Parkinson's\\n\\nand maybe Alzheimer's related dementia as well.\\n\\nThese are not terribly controversial data\\n\\nbecause of the fact that caffeine is known\\n\\nto increase the release of those catecholamines,\\n\\ndopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine\\n\\nas well as acetylcholine.\\n\\nAll those neurotransmitter and neuromodulator systems\\n\\nare the ones that are known to be defective\\n\\nin Parkinson's and Alzheimer's,\\n\\nalthough there are other transmitter and hormone systems\\n\\nthat are defective as well.\\n\\nThere are beautiful reviews on the neuroprotective effects\\n\\nof caffeine and neurodegenerative diseases.\\n\\nThey're quite extensive.\\n\\nAnd I'll just refer you to one\\n\\nand the references therein.\\n\\nAnd we'll provide a link to this in the show note captions.\\n\\nSo the title, as the topic at hand suggests\\n\\nis the neuroprotective effects of caffeine\\n\\nand neurodegenerative diseases.\\n\\nThis was published in 2016.\\n\\nI'm sure there have been other reviews since then,\\n\\nbut it includes many, many quality references\\n\\nand studies both in animals and in humans\\n\\npointing to the fact that specific enzymes\\n\\nthat are associated with the health\\n\\nof in particular dopamine neurons\\n\\nare made more robust by regular ingestion of caffeine.\\n\\nIt also points to the fact that the increase\\n\\nin dopamine receptors that is induced\\n\\nby regular ingestion of caffeine that I referred to earlier\\n\\nis another way in which dopamine,\\n\\nhowever many dopamine neurons remain around\\n\\nin people with Parkinson's or people who are aging\\n\\nthat lose dopamine neurons naturally,\\n\\nthat dopamine can have its maximal effect\\n\\nbecause of the increase in receptors for dopamine\\n\\nthat caffeine induces.\\n\\nAnd there are other biological mechanisms\\n\\nthat further support why caffeine\\n\\nought to be neuroprotective,\\n\\nincluding its effects on the acetylcholine system,\\n\\nwhich is one of the major systems disrupted\\n\\nin Alzheimer's dementia.\\n\\nSo in other words, it makes perfect sense\\n\\nas to why caffeine would be neuroprotective.\\n\\nCaffeine has also been shown to diminish headache,\\n\\nparticularly when taken in combination with aspirin.\\n\\nAnd that's because of the effects\\n\\nof caffeine and aspirin on blood flow.\\n\\nThere's also evidence that caffeine can provide brief\\n\\nbut substantial relief from asthma.\\n\\nSo I wouldn't want people to rely on caffeine\\n\\nas a life-saving approach to an asthmatic attack.\\n\\nThat said, for people that suffer from minor asthma,\\n\\nthat caffeine intake, again, of the dosages\\n\\nthat we talked about before has been shown\\n\\nto alleviate some of the major symptoms of asthma\\n\\nfor anywhere from one to four hours.\\n\\nAnd I know this is of relevance\\n\\nto a lot of people out there.\\n\\nBecause caffeine increases the catecholamines\\n\\nand in particular because caffeine increases dopamine\\n\\ntransmission in the prefrontal cortex,\\n\\nthis area of the brain associated with focus\\n\\nand rule setting and context and task switching.\\n\\nCaffeine is known to improve focus and alertness\\n\\nin particular in people who have symptoms of ADHD\\n\\nor other attention and focus issues.\\n\\nNow, caffeine alone does not appear to be as potent\\n\\nfor the treatment of ADHD as are things like Ritalin,\\n\\nAdderall, Modafinil and Armodafinil and Vyvanse.\\n\\nIf you would like a sort of head-by-head comparison\\n\\nof prescription drugs, supplements,\\n\\nand things like caffeine, as well as coverage\\n\\nof behavioral tools and nutritional tools, et cetera,\\n\\nthat can positively offset some of the symptoms of ADHD,\\n\\nplease see the episode that I did on ADHD.\\n\\nAgain, that's available at hubermanlab.com in all formats.\\n\\nBut that said, caffeine does increase focus\\n\\nand it does it through a number of different mechanisms,\\n\\nnot the least of which is to increase dopamine transmission\\n\\nin the forebrain, just as a drug like Ritalin or Adderall\\n\\nwould, although not to the same extent\\n\\nas a drug like Ritalin or Adderall does.\\n\\nBefore we close today, I do want to just briefly return\\n\\nto the reinforcing effects of caffeine\\n\\nthat we talked about earlier.\\n\\nThis study on the honeybees that showed that bees\\n\\nprefer certain nectars because they contain caffeine,\\n\\neven though they are not aware\\n\\nthat those nectars contain caffeine.\\n\\nThey just come to like the feeling\\n\\nthat those nectars provide them so much\\n\\nthat they associate that in a subconscious way\\n\\nwith the flowers themselves,\\n\\nand they come to like those flowers.\\n\\nOr human beings, for instance,\\n\\nchildren that ingest caffeinated beverages\\n\\ncome to adore the taste of those beverages.\\n\\nAnd beautiful studies have been done\\n\\nthat describe how children and adults\\n\\ntruly cannot distinguish between the taste\\n\\nof a caffeinated and non-caffeinated beverage,\\n\\nand caffeine can be placed into essentially any beverage\\n\\nin order to give us a preference for that beverage or food.\\n\\nIn fact, the studies have been done with yogurt.\\n\\nIf you put caffeine into yogurt of different flavors,\\n\\neven plain yogurt, which most kids don't like,\\n\\nthey will come to prefer whatever flavor\\n\\ncontain the caffeine,\\n\\neven if then you remove the caffeine from that flavor.\\n\\nNow, eventually their preference for that flavor\\n\\nwill be extinguished,\\n\\nbut all of this is just to say\\n\\nthat so many of the things that we like,\\n\\nwhether or not it's coffee or tea\\n\\nor a given flavor of food or a given experience\\n\\nor even exercise occur because we ingest caffeine\\n\\nin conjunction with those activities.\\n\\nNow, these are not tricks\\n\\nthat your nervous system plays on you.\\n\\nThese are real neurochemical reinforcing effects.\\n\\nAnd I think that we would all do well to think about\\n\\nand to leverage these reinforcing effects\\n\\nmuch in the same way we would do well\\n\\nto think about and hopefully not leverage\\n\\naversive effects of certain compounds, right?\\n\\nThe simple way to put this is I or anyone could get you\\n\\nto dislike something, someone or someplace\\n\\nby making you feel slightly less good, lower mood.\\n\\nI don't even have to make you feel nauseous,\\n\\nbut less good after ingesting something\\n\\nor having a certain kind of interaction\\n\\nor being in a certain environment.\\n\\nVery straightforward to do that\\n\\nbecause of the way that your nervous system\\n\\nis wired for conditioning.\\n\\nHowever, there's the positive side of all this,\\n\\nwhich is that it's very straightforward\\n\\nto reinforce the experience of a given food,\\n\\nincluding its taste, but all the context around it,\\n\\nthe container, the texture, the people you consume it with,\\n\\nwhere you consume it, et cetera.\\n\\nFor instance, I wonder why we are not pairing caffeine\\n\\nwith broccoli and that here I'm not suggesting\\n\\nthat people actually do that experiment\\n\\nor play that trick on people,\\n\\nbut you have to sort of imagine\\n\\nthat if caffeine is this incredible reinforcer\\n\\nof all sorts of things, in particular,\\n\\nthings that we ingest and would want to ingest more of\\n\\nif it's paired with caffeine,\\n\\nwell, then you actually can use caffeine as a tool\\n\\nto increase reinforcement of different things\\n\\nand you can avoid caffeine as a way\\n\\nto further reinforce things that you would like to stop.\\n\\nAnd here I'd like to just give the example\\n\\nof sugar cravings.\\n\\nA lot of people ask me, how do I avoid sugar cravings?\\n\\nI've talked about the use of L-glutamine for that.\\n\\nI've talked about making sure\\n\\nyou're getting enough essential fatty acids\\n\\nand essential amino acids as a way to reduce sugar cravings.\\n\\nPlease note, however, that if you are somebody\\n\\nwho likes to have your sugar,\\n\\nwhether or not it's a piece of chocolate\\n\\nor your dessert, et cetera, I'm not saying that's bad,\\n\\nbut if you're trying to reduce your sugar cravings,\\n\\nask yourself, are you ingesting sugar along with caffeine?\\n\\nCould be the caffeine contained in that sugar\\n\\ncontaining food like chocolate,\\n\\nor it could be that you're having a cup of coffee\\n\\nalong with your pastry\\n\\nand then you're struggling with sugar cravings.\\n\\nWell, think about it.\\n\\nYou're not just being reinforced by the sugar\\n\\nand the effects of sugar on dopamine,\\n\\nwhich are real and both conscious and subconscious\\n\\nthrough the gut to the brain dopamine system\\n\\nand direct on the brain dopamine system.\\n\\nBut by co-ingesting caffeine,\\n\\nyou are also further enhancing\\n\\nthe reinforcing effects of sugar.\\n\\nThe flip side to all of this is that you could use caffeine\\n\\nas a way to increase your appetite for certain things.\\n\\nI actually know somebody,\\n\\nI won't reveal who this person is,\\n\\nbut they are quite prominent podcaster\\n\\nwho ingests 125 to 150 milligrams of caffeine\\n\\nin tablet form, in tablet form,\\n\\nalong with herbal tea and use this as a way\\n\\nto develop a preference for herbal tea\\n\\nbecause they found that coffee was giving them other effects\\n\\nthat weren't good for them.\\n\\nSo it works quite well in animals\\n\\nand it works quite well in insects\\n\\nand it works quite well in humans.\\n\\nI suppose animals, insects and humans are all animals\\n\\nat the end of the day.\\n\\nSo no surprise there,\\n\\nbut it all underscores the extent to which caffeine\\n\\nis an absolutely fascinating molecule.\\n\\nI mean, it's an ability to offset the sleepiness system,\\n\\nif you will, this adenosine system\\n\\nand to control our schedules in that way,\\n\\nto essentially take a withdrawal against the bank\\n\\nthat is adenosine and then pay that back later\\n\\nin the form of getting sleepy later\\n\\nas opposed to when we want to be alert.\\n\\nIts ability to enhance focus, alertness and mood\\n\\nand if taken after trying to learn something\\n\\nand remember it to enhance memory, especially,\\n\\nand its ability to increase VO2 max, increase strength.\\n\\nWe didn't even talk today about it,\\n\\nbut I'll just briefly mention that caffeine ingested\\n\\nin the sorts of doses we talked about earlier\\n\\nbecause its effects on the neuromuscular system\\n\\nand the calcium system associated\\n\\nwith neuromuscular exertion and fatigue\\n\\ncan increase peak power output and muscle contractibility.\\n\\nIt's enhancing performance there as well.\\n\\nAnd of course, caffeine does a number of other things\\n\\njust generally related to our overall\\n\\nand basal level of mood and alertness,\\n\\nnot the least of which are these increases in dopamine.\\n\\nSo caffeine is really an incredible molecule.\\n\\nIt's affecting all these various neurotransmitter systems,\\n\\nbut not haphazardly.\\n\\nIt's increasing dopamine and acetylcholine\\n\\nin the forebrain to increase attention.\\n\\nIt's reducing fatigue.\\n\\nIt's improving mental and physical performance\\n\\nfor some obvious and some not so obvious reasons\\n\\nand what I think is among the more miraculous\\n\\nand powerful effects of caffeine,\\n\\nit is a potent, potent, potent reinforcer\\n\\nof things, foods, people, and experiences.\\n\\nAnd it's one that you can leverage\\n\\nin any direction that you like\\n\\nonce you understand the way that caffeine exerts\\n\\nthose reinforcing properties.\\n\\nSo today I've really tried to cover as much as I could\\n\\nabout the mechanisms of caffeine action\\n\\nin the brain and body,\\n\\nas well as tools and schedules and dosages\\n\\nin which you can leverage caffeine\\n\\nin order to meet your physical performance,\\n\\nmental performance, and frankly,\\n\\nmental health and overall health goals.\\n\\nIf you're learning from and are enjoying this podcast,\\n\\nplease subscribe to our

       " Document(page_content=\"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\n\\nwhere we discuss science\\n\\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\\n\\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\\n\\nand I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology\\n\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\n\\nToday, we are discussing placebo effects.\\n\\nWe will also be discussing what are called nocebo effects,\\n\\nas well as belief effects.\\n\\nAll three of these, placebo, nocebo, and belief effects,\\n\\nare all related to our brain's incredible ability\\n\\nto place an expectation on what is about to happen\\n\\nand actually change what is about to happen,\\n\\nindependent of the physical and chemical properties\\n\\nof a drug or some sort of other treatment solution\\n\\nfor things like pain, Parkinson's disease,\\n\\nirritable bowel syndrome, asthma, stress,\\n\\nand on and on and on.\\n\\nNow, one of the most incredible things about these effects\\n\\nis that despite the fact that it would appear\\n\\nthat they are simply psychological\\n\\nor the power of the mind over matter, it's not that at all.\\n\\nPlacebo, nocebo, and belief effects\\n\\nactually change the way your biology, your physiology works.\\n\\nIn fact, you have neural circuits within your brain\\n\\nthat are dedicated to how your expectation\\n\\nof what will happen actually changes\\n\\nsome of the most core biological functions\\n\\nwithin your brain and body,\\n\\nmodifying, for instance, heart rate, blood pressure,\\n\\nthe release of specific neuromodulators\\n\\nsuch as dopamine and adrenaline.\\n\\nAnd so powerfully so that these types of effects\\n\\ncan actually work along with traditional drug treatments\\n\\nor behavioral treatments in order to vastly change\\n\\nthe way that your brain and body work.\\n\\nSo if you think of the word placebo\\n\\nas an inert substance or treatment\\n\\nthat is merely a control,\\n\\nit's merely something introduced to an experiment\\n\\nor a clinical trial to try and figure out\\n\\nwhat's happening normally in somebody's brain or body\\n\\nas a comparison to some drug or other type of treatment.\\n\\nWell, while that can be true\\n\\nand placebo controls are vital for certain clinical studies,\\n\\nit's also the case that placebos, nocebos,\\n\\nand belief effects have powerful impact on our physiology,\\n\\nentirely separate from all of that,\\n\\nso much so that several highly esteemed researchers\\n\\nin the medical community around the world\\n\\nbelieve that placebo, nocebo, and belief effects\\n\\nshould actually be leveraged in the treatment\\n\\nof various diseases as their own unique treatment.\\n\\nSo by the end of today's episode,\\n\\nyou're going to have a clear understanding\\n\\nof what placebo, nocebo, and belief effects are,\\n\\ntheir biological underpinnings,\\n\\nand the way that you can leverage them\\n\\ntoward your mental health, physical health, and performance.\\n\\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast\\n\\nis separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.\\n\\nIt is, however, part of my desire and effort\\n\\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\\n\\nabout science and science-related tools\\n\\nto the general public.\\n\\nIn keeping with that theme,\\n\\nI'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.\\n\\nOur first sponsor is 8Sleep.\\n\\n8Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling,\\n\\nheating, and sleep tracking capacity.\\n\\nNow, I've spoken many times before on this podcast\\n\\nabout the fact that sleep is the foundation\\n\\nof mental health, physical health, and performance.\\n\\nNow, one of the key things for getting a great night's sleep\\n\\nis the temperature of your sleeping environment.\\n\\nFor instance, in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,\\n\\nyour body temperature needs to drop\\n\\nby about one to three degrees.\\n\\nAnd in order to wake up feeling refreshed,\\n\\nyour body temperature actually has to increase\\n\\nby about one to three degrees.\\n\\nWith 8Sleep, it makes it very easy\\n\\nto control the temperature of your sleeping environment.\\n\\nYou can dial in specific temperature ranges\\n\\nfor the beginning, middle, and end of your night.\\n\\nIt even has a sleep tracker,\\n\\nso it will track your slow-wave sleep, REM sleep,\\n\\ntotal sleep, and give you a sleep score.\\n\\nAnd you can actually divide the mattress\\n\\ninto two different temperatures\\n\\nif someone else in your bed likes things\\n\\na different temperature, and they, of course,\\n\\ncan have their sleep track independently of yours.\\n\\nIt's an absolutely wonderful tool.\\n\\nIt's completely transformed my sleep,\\n\\nso much so that when I travel to hotels or Airbnbs,\\n\\nI find I don't ever sleep as well\\n\\nas when I have my 8Sleep.\\n\\nI've even shipped my 8Sleep out to those places.\\n\\nThat gets a little complicated,\\n\\nbut that's how much I love my 8Sleep.\\n\\nIt gives me the best possible night's sleep.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try 8Sleep,\\n\\nyou can go to 8Sleep.com slash Huberman\\n\\nto save up

also brought to us by Aeropress.\\n\\nAeropress is similar to a French press for making coffee,\\n\\nbut is in fact a much better way to make coffee.\\n\\nI first learned about Aeropress well over 10 years ago,\\n\\nand I've been using one ever since.\\n\\nAeropress was developed by Alan Adler,\\n\\nwho was an engineer at Stanford.\\n\\nAnd I knew of Alan because he had also built\\n\\nthe so-called Aerobi Frisbee.\\n\\nSo he was sort of famous in our community\\n\\nfor developing these different feats of engineering\\n\\nthat turned into commercial products.\\n\\nNow, I love coffee.\\n\\nI'm somebody that drinks coffee nearly every day,\\n\\nusually about 90 to 120 minutes\\n\\nafter I wake up in the morning, although not always.\\n\\nSometimes if I'm going to exercise,\\n\\nI'll drink coffee first thing in the morning.\\n\\nBut I love, love, love coffee.\\n\\nAnd what I've personally found is that\\n\\nby using the Aeropress,\\n\\nI can make the best possible tasting cup of coffee.\\n\\nI don't know what exactly it is in the Aeropress\\n\\nthat allows the same beans to be prepared\\n\\ninto a cup of coffee that tastes that much better\\n\\nas compared to any other form of brewing that coffee,\\n\\neven the traditional French press.\\n\\nThe Aeropress is extremely easy to use,\\n\\nand it's extremely compact.\\n\\nIn fact, I take it with me whenever I travel\\n\\nand I use it on the road in hotels, even on planes.\\n\\nI'll just ask for some hot water\\n\\nand I'll brew my coffee or tea right there on the plane.\\n\\nWith over 55,000 five-star reviews,\\n\\nAeropress is the best reviewed coffee press in the world.\\n\\nIf you would like to try Aeropress,\\n\\nyou can go to aeropress.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nThat's

your sleep patterns\\n\\nimpact your health by giving you real-time feedback\\n\\non your diet using a continuous glucose monitor.\\n\\nNow, blood glucose, sometimes referred to as blood sugar,\\n\\nhas an immediate and long-term impact\\n\\non your energy levels and your overall health.\\n\\nOne of the best ways to maintain focus\\n\\nand energy throughout your day,\\n\\nas well as to keep your so-called metabolic health\\n\\nin best order is to make sure\\n\\nthat your blood glucose never spikes too much\\n\\nnor does it get too low.\\n\\nWith Levels, you can monitor how different foods\\n\\nand food combinations impact your blood glucose levels\\n\\non a moment-to-moment basis.\\n\\nI've been using Levels for some time now,\\n\\nand it's really helped me understand\\n\\nwhich foods and food combinations,\\n\\nexercise schedules, and sleep schedules\\n\\nare optimal for my blood glucose levels\\n\\nand how that translates to energy levels\\n\\nand other metrics of health.\\n\\nIf you're interested in learning more about Levels\\n\\nand trying a continuous glucose monitor,\\n\\nyou can go to levels.link slash Huberman.\\n\\nLevels has just launched a new CGM sensor\\n\\nthat is smaller and has even better tracking than before.\\n\\nRight now, they're also offering\\n\\ntwo free months of membership.\\n\\nAgain, that's levels.link, L-I-N-K slash Huberman\\n\\nto try the new sensor and two free months of membership.\\n\\nOkay, let's talk about placebo effects.\\n\\nI will also be talking about nocebo effects,\\n\\nand let's just establish the difference between those.\\n\\nPlacebo effects are when an inert substance\\n\\nor behavioral treatment, that is a substance\\n\\nor behavioral treatment that is not going to have\\n\\nany kind of direct biological or psychological activity,\\n\\nright, it shouldn't do anything on its own,\\n\\nsomehow does in the direction\\n\\nof improving symptoms or performance.\\n\\nNow, let's contrast that with nocebo.\\n\\nNocebo is when a drug or behavioral intervention,\\n\\nwhich is inert, it should have no impact on symptoms\\n\\nor performance of any kind, but with nocebo,\\n\\nit turns out these substances or behavioral interventions\\n\\nactually worsen symptoms or performance.\\n\\nNow, oftentimes people will just say a placebo effect.\\n\\nIt's a little bit more rare for people to distinguish\\n\\nbetween placebo and nocebo effects,\\n\\nbut I do think it's important to know their difference.\\n\\nGoing forward, I'll mostly just refer to these\\n\\nas placebo effects, but I'll talk about nocebo effects\\n\\na little bit later.\\n\\nI'll also talk about belief effects.\\n\\nSo let's just establish what belief effects are.\\n\\nBelief effects are when you or somebody else\\n\\nlearns specific knowledge that changes your expectation\\n\\nabout what is going to happen in reference to, say, stress\\n\\nor consuming a given food or taking a given drug\\n\\nor doing a specific behavioral protocol,\\n\\nand the specific information you learn or assimilate\\n\\nactually leads to that specific outcome.\\n\\nSo in many ways, belief effects\\n\\nand placebo effects are similar.\\n\\nIt's just that the word placebo or placebo effects\\n\\nis commonly used to refer to drugs\\n\\nand behavioral interventions.\\n\\nBelief effects are more specific language used to describe\\n\\nwhen information of any kind changes the outcome\\n\\nof some physiological or psychological process.\\n\\nNow, what's common to placebo, nocebo, and belief effects\\n\\nis that they all work by changing expectation.\\n\\nAnd anytime we talk about expectation,\\n\\nwe're talking about the function of the nervous system\\n\\nand specifically the brain\\n\\nand specifically the prefrontal cortex within the brain.\\n\\nThe prefrontal cortex is neural real estate,\\n\\nwhich is just fancy nerd speak for the neurons\\n\\nand their connections that reside just behind your forehead,\\n\\njust in the front of your skull.\\n\\nNow, the prefrontal cortex\\n\\nhas a lot of different subdivisions or regions.\\n\\nThe overall function of the prefrontal cortex\\n\\ncan be described as having the ability to either activate\\n\\nor suppress other neural circuits deeper in the brain.\\n\\nSome people, in fact, a previous guest\\n\\non the Huberman Lab podcast, a neurosurgeon,\\n\\nsaid the prefrontal cortex can generally be described\\n\\nas the structure in the brain\\n\\nthat controls other structures in the brain\\n\\nby saying shh or suppressing their function.\\n\\nSo for instance, if you have the impulse to move or to shout,\\n\\nthe prefrontal cortex suppresses that movement\\n\\nor suppresses that desire to shout or that shouting.\\n\\nIf you've ever had the experience of, you know,\\n\\ngoing to the edge of a cliff or being on a high bridge\\n\\nand thinking, oh my goodness, like, you know,\\n\\nyou just have this spontaneous thought,\\n\\nwhich please don't do this in action,\\n\\nbut one will have this thought like, oh my goodness,\\n\\nlike, what if I just jumped off?\\n\\nAnd people think, oh my goodness, you know,\\n\\ndo I have some sort of death wish?\\n\\nWell, no, the prefrontal cortex\\n\\nbeing largely a context evaluating and prediction machine\\n\\nis essentially looking at that landscape\\n\\nand predicting what would happen, indeed,\\n\\nhow bad it would be if you were to jump off that bridge\\n\\nor jump off that cliff.\\n\\nAnd then you feel that, oh my goodness,\\n\\nlike, what's wrong with me?\\n\\nWhy would I think this?\\n\\nBut the fact that you think it even for a moment,\\n\\nbut you don't do it,\\n\\nand the fact that you recognize\\n\\nthat it's sort of a, you know, a dangerous thought,\\n\\ncertainly a dangerous action,\\n\\nagain, please don't engage in the action,\\n\\ntells you that your prefrontal cortex is working properly.\\n\\nAgain, the prefrontal cortex is involved\\n\\nin suppressing certain types of behaviors\\n\\nand what sorts of behaviors?\\n\\nWell, the larger theme of the prefrontal cortex\\n\\nthat we need to consider today\\n\\nis that it is an expectation or prediction-making machine.\\n\\nIt is a bunch of neurons that release chemicals\\n\\nand have electrical activity that are speaking with\\n\\nand receiving information from other areas of the brain.\\n\\nAnd it's evaluating a number of things like context,\\n\\nlike what's going on in this room?\\n\\nWhat's going on in this scene?\\n\\nWhat's supposed to happen here?\\n\\nWhat might I do?\\n\\nWhat should I do?\\n\\nWhat should I not do, et cetera, et cetera.\\n\\nNow, the other thing about the prefrontal cortex,\\n\\ngiven that it has all these different subdivisions,\\n\\nis that some of those subdivisions have a unique,\\n\\nwhat we call labeled line communication,\\n\\nlike a unique highway that leads to specific brain areas\\n\\nthat control specific bodily functions,\\n\\nincluding heart rate, blood pressure, et cetera.\\n\\nAnd a little bit later in the episode,\\n\\nI'll talk about a specific paper,\\n\\nit's one of my favorite papers,\\n\\nin which a specific prefrontal cortical region\\n\\nis identified as controlling very primitive aspects\\n\\nof our physiology, such as body temperature and heart rate,\\n\\nin reference to beliefs or what's happening\\n\\nin a social scene.\\n\\nAnd this is very different from the way that, say,\\n\\ngetting into cold water,\\n\\nor experiencing some other sort of stressor\\n\\ncauses increase in heart rate or vasoconstriction.\\n\\nWhat we're talking about here,\\n\\nwhen we talk about placebo, nocebo, and belief effects,\\n\\nare the way in which you learn information,\\n\\nor you are told information,\\n\\nlike, hey, this pill is going to do blank,\\n\\nmaybe because the label says it,\\n\\nmaybe because the scientist or the doctor tells you\\n\\nthat this pill does blank, or this injection will do blank,\\n\\nor maybe you learn some information\\n\\nabout what some specific drug or supplement\\n\\nor behavioral protocol will do.\\n\\nAnd in that learning,\\n\\nyou come to expect a specific set of effects.\\n\\nAnd certain neural circuits\\n\\nin the prefrontal cortex become active\\n\\nand start to activate certain neural circuits\\n\\ndeeper in the brain, in areas like the hypothalamus.\\n\\nThese are ancient, very well-conserved across animals,\\n\\nareas of the brain that control very primitive functions.\\n\\nOkay, they exist in essentially all mammals\\n\\nand even in reptiles.\\n\\nThe prefrontal cortex also communicates\\n\\nwith areas of your brainstem,\\n\\ncontrolling things like breathing, et cetera.\\n\\nSo the prefrontal cortex is a sophisticated area\\n\\nof your brain that takes into account context,\\n\\nboth in the present, as well as memories from the past.\\n\\nIt can take into consideration goals about the future,\\n\\nand then combines all of that into neural signals\\n\\nto areas of the brain\\n\\nthat control basic physiological functions\\n\\nrelated to the immune system, the stress system,\\n\\nthe reward system, the pleasure system, and on and on.\\n\\nSo when we talk about placebo, nocebo, and belief effects,\\n\\nwhat we're really talking about\\n\\nis the ability for information and specific experiences\\n\\nto lead to expectations within us\\n\\nabout what's going to happen,\\n\\nand then our physiology of our brain and body\\n\\nfundamentally changes such that those things happen.\\n\\nSo let's talk about some specific examples of placebo effects\\n\\nfrom the research literature.\\n\\nAnd today we're going to cover a lot of different examples\\n\\nfrom different systems.\\n\\nBut as we do that,\\n\\nI will specifically be selecting examples\\n\\nthat illustrate different types of placebo effects\\n\\nand illustrate what those different types\\n\\nof placebo effects are.\\n\\nNow I should mention that if you're interested\\n\\nin placebo effects, there's a wonderful book\\n\\nthat describes many, many different placebo effects\\n\\nand their biological underpinnings\\n\\nin cases where those biological underpinnings are understood.\\n\\nAnd the book I'm referring to is one that I used prominently\\n\\nin researching this episode.\\n\\nIt's called, none other than,\\n\\nPlacebo Effects, Understanding the Other Side\\n\\nof Medical Care.\\n\\nAnd the book is by Fabrizio Benedetti.\\n\\nI hope I pronounced that right, Fabrizio.\\n\\nAnd to your Italians out there,\\n\\nif I didn't do it correctly, I apologize.\\n\\nIt's an absolutely wonderful book.\\n\\nI confess I've never met Fabrizio Benedetti.\\n\\nI confess I have no relation to the publisher\\n\\nor to the book itself,\\n\\nexcept that I absolutely love the book.\\n\\nSo highly recommend this book.\\n\\nI'll be pulling from a number of different examples\\n\\ndescribed in this book today.\\n\\nTo my mind, one of the most interesting examples\\n\\nof the placebo effect is where placebo is given\\n\\nand can profoundly change levels\\n\\nof dopamine release in the brain.\\n\\nNow, the study I'm about to describe\\n\\nwas done in Parkinson's patients.\\n\\nPeople with Parkinson's have degeneration of neurons\\n\\nin an area of the brain called the substantia nigra,\\n\\nwhich is an area of the brain\\n\\nin the kind of bottom back part of the brain.\\n\\nFor you aficionados, it's the ventral tegmental area,\\n\\nbut you don't need to know that name.\\n\\nThese neurons contain dopamine and are essential\\n\\nfor the generation of smooth movement patterns,\\n\\nincluding walking and reaching\\n\\nand moving one's hand to right, et cetera.\\n\\nAnd of course, dopamine is involved\\n\\nin a bunch of other things too,\\n\\nincluding motivation and reward.\\n\\nIn people with Parkinson's,\\n\\ndepending on how severe and advanced the Parkinson's is,\\n\\nthey suffer deficits in the ability\\n\\nto generate smooth movements\\n\\nand often deficits in motivation\\n\\nand reward pathways as well.\\n\\nNow there are many different treatments for Parkinson's,\\n\\nsome more successful than others.\\n\\nUnfortunately, it's still not completely curable,\\n\\nat least not at this time,\\n\\nbut most of the drugs that are successful\\n\\nin treating Parkinson's to some degree or another\\n\\nare drugs that increase levels of dopamine within the brain\\n\\nfor obvious reasons.\\n\\nAs I just mentioned, Parkinson's is a degeneration\\n\\nof the dopaminergic, meaning dopamine containing\\n\\nand releasing neurons in the brain.\\n\\nSo people with Parkinson's will often be given L-Dopa,\\n\\nwhich is a precursor to dopamine\\n\\nor other types of drugs\\n\\nthat increase dopamine within the brain.\\n\\nNow there have been a number of studies\\n\\nthat have compared certain drugs known to increase dopamine\\n\\nsuch as L-Dopa, things like apomorphine,\\n\\nbromocryptine, et cetera, to placebo control drugs.\\n\\nAnd one of the interesting takeaways from those studies\\n\\nis that yes, drugs like L-Dopa, bromocryptine, et cetera,\\n\\nincrease dopamine and at least can partially\\n\\nor transiently improve symptoms of Parkinson's in many,\\n\\nnot all patients with Parkinson's.\\n\\nThe placebo drugs given in many of those studies,\\n\\nwhich were simply a sugar pill or some other inert pill,\\n\\nit doesn't contain any chemicals\\n\\nthat are known to directly bind to\\n\\nor increase dopamine in the brain.\\n\\nAnd yet nonetheless, when the brains\\n\\nof certain patients were imaged,\\n\\nit was clear that not only was there an improvement\\n\\nin symptomology, but there were increases\\n\\nin dopamine release within those patients' brains,\\n\\nwhich on the face of it should make no sense.\\n\\nHowever, when people with Parkinson's\\n\\nor people who even don't have Parkinson's\\n\\nare told a given drug can increase dopamine\\n\\nand then they put these people into a brain imaging device,\\n\\nit's called a PET device, has nothing to do with animals,\\n\\nit's the positron emission tomography device.\\n\\nAnd these people had been injected with\\n\\nor consumed something called raclopride.\\n\\nIt sounds really weird and dangerous,\\n\\nbut actually raclopride looks a little bit\\n\\nlike dopamine itself chemically\\n\\nand it has a little tag or label on it\\n\\nand it can bind to certain receptors in the brain\\n\\nwhere dopamine would normally bind.\\n\\nWhat was observed is that the placebo itself\\n\\nwas causing reduced binding of this raclopride\\n\\nto areas of the brain that have dopamine receptors,\\n\\nwhich meant unequivocally\\n\\nthat there was more dopamine released in the brain\\n\\nbecause if more dopamine is released in the brain\\n\\nand parks in those receptors, well, then the raclopride,\\n\\nwhich looks a lot like dopamine,\\n\\nyou can't also park or bind to those receptors.\\n\\nSimply put, a placebo drug,\\n\\nagain, a drug that has no direct action\\n\\non the dopaminergic system,\\n\\nif it's given to somebody who has Parkinson's or who doesn't\\n\\nand they are told this drug is going to increase levels\\n\\nof dopamine in your brain\\n\\nand potentially improve your symptoms of Parkinson's\\n\\nor have some other effect,\\n\\nwell, it succeeded in increasing dopamine levels\\n\\nwithin the brain,\\n\\nwhich basically should make us all sit back and say,\\n\\nwhat are we to think of drugs like L-Dopa and apomorphine,\\n\\nbromocryptine as compared to placebo?\\n\\nWhy isn't everyone just taking placebo?\\n\\nWhy aren't we just telling people,\\n\\nhey, this sugar pill is going to increase dopamine?\\n\\nWell, two important points to answer that.\\n\\nFirst of all, the increases in dopamine\\n\\nthat are observed from placebo,\\n\\nplus information about what that placebo ought to do\\n\\nfor increasing dopamine are not as robust,\\n\\nor I should say generally not as robust\\n\\nas the increases in dopamine observed\\n\\nfrom an actual drug known to increase dopamine transmission\\n\\nor release within the brain.\\n\\nThe second point is that the structure\\n\\nof the information given to somebody\\n\\nand the belief that they form about what ought to happen,\\n\\nthat is the expectation effect,\\n\\nwhich you'll start to realize more and more\\n\\nacross today's episode,\\n\\nthat expectation effect really is the underpinning\\n\\nof the placebo effect.\\n\\nWell, the strength of that expectation\\n\\nis really hard to anchor across individuals.\\n\\nAnd in fact, if people realize they're taking a placebo,\\n\\nthe magnitude of the dopamine increase is actually decreased.\\n\\nSo this is why we use placebo controls in clinical trials.\\n\\nWe want to establish the real difference\\n\\nbetween the effect of a given drug on a biological system,\\n\\nin this case, increasing dopamine,\\n\\nfrom the belief or the expectation\\n\\nof what that drug will do.\\n\\nSo in that sense, the placebo is really a measure\\n\\nof expectation of what a drug treatment will do,\\n\\nat least in the context of a drug trial.\\n\\nSo I mentioned this somewhat complicated example,\\n\\nbecause first of all,\\n\\nmany people are interested in dopamine.\\n\\nWe all make dopamine.\\n\\nIt's involved in motivation, drive and focus and reward,\\n\\nall sorts of things that we hear a lot about these days.\\n\\nSecond of all, it really illustrates that placebo,\\n\\nthat is expectation about what will happen,\\n\\nis impacting, of course, placebo effects.\\n\\nYou realize that now,\\n\\nbut it then also has to be the case\\n\\nthat placebo effects are playing into any effect\\n\\nthat we might observe from taking a given drug\\n\\nor supplement based on our expectation\\n\\nof what that drug or supplement will do.\\n\\nAnd miraculously, or at least what I find miraculous,\\n\\nis that placebo effects,\\n\\nthese expectations based on knowledge and beliefs,\\n\\nare highly specific,\\n\\nwhich raises all sorts of questions about, for instance,\\n\\nif you were given a drug that increases dopamine levels,\\n\\nbut you weren't told that it increases dopamine levels,\\n\\nthat perhaps you were told, you were lied to,\\n\\nand told that it increases the activity\\n\\nof a different neuromodulator like serotonin, would it?\\n\\nWell, let's explore that because as wild as that seems,\\n\\nit turns out that what we believe about a given drug\\n\\ntreatment or behavioral treatment\\n\\nactually has a high degree of specificity.\\n\\nSo to illustrate the incredible specificity\\n\\nof placebo effects,\\n\\nI want to describe a study related to hormone function.\\n\\nHormones come in many different forms.\\n\\nWe have testosterone, estrogen, growth hormone,\\n\\ncortisol, et cetera.\\n\\nThere's a study that was carried out in humans\\n\\nin which subjects were informed about growth hormone release\\n\\nand cortisol release.\\n\\nGrowth hormone is a hormone released from a gland\\n\\nin the brain called the pituitary.\\n\\nThe pituitary has different parts.\\n\\nThe anterior pituitary releases growth hormone.\\n\\nEach night when you go to sleep,\\n\\nit's involved in protein synthesis, tissue repair,\\n\\nbodily growth, appendage growth, and many other things.\\n\\nCortisol is a hormone that's released from the adrenals.\\n\\nIt can also be synthesized and released\\n\\na couple other places in the brain and body.\\n\\nAnd it's involved in immune system function\\n\\nand anti-inflammatory action.\\n\\nA lot of people think cortisol is bad,\\n\\nbut it's actually an important hormone for our daily health,\\n\\nour alertness and waking up in the morning, et cetera.\\n\\nIn any event, subjects in this study\\n\\nlearned about growth hormone and cortisol\\n\\nand their release,\\n\\nwhere they're released from, what they do,\\n\\njust as you did.\\n\\nAnd then their growth hormone and cortisol levels\\n\\nwere measured.\\n\\nAnd not surprisingly, they didn't change.\\n\\nJust learning about growth hormone and cortisol\\n\\ndid not change growth hormone or cortisol levels\\n\\nin these human subjects.\\n\\nNow, on days two and three of this experiment,\\n\\nsubjects received an injection of a drug.\\n\\nThe drug is called Sumatriptan.\\n\\nAnd Sumatriptan is known to increase levels\\n\\nof growth hormone and reduce levels of cortisol.\\n\\nAnd indeed, that's what they observed.\\n\\nWhen people received these injections\\n\\nand then their blood was drawn,\\n\\ngrowth hormone levels went up,\\n\\ncortisol levels went down.\\n\\nNow, the interesting part of the study\\n\\nis a separate day, okay?\\n\\nSo after the drug treatments,\\n\\nthey come back and they are injected with saline,\\n\\nwhich has no specific biological effect.\\n\\nIt's simply salt water, okay?\\n\\nThey're injected with saline\\n\\nand they experience increases in growth hormone\\n\\nand decreases in cortisol,\\n\\nwhich on the face of it might seem like,\\n\\nwow, that's incredible.\\n\\nBut based on what you've learned thus far\\n\\nin today's episode,\\n\\nyou could imagine that knowledge about growth hormone\\n\\nand cortisol somehow combined with the injection\\n\\nto lead to an expectation of increases in growth hormone\\n\\nand decreases in cortisol,\\n\\nwhich would be amazing in its own right, okay?\\n\\nAfter all, saline is inert.\\n\\nIt doesn't do anything directly and specifically\\n\\nto the growth hormone or cortisol system, but get this.\\n\\nIt turns out that a saline injection,\\n\\nwhich does nothing on its own,\\n\\non day four or five after people have received\\n\\nthis drug treatment,\\n\\nincreases growth hormone and decreases cortisol\\n\\nindependent of what people are told\\n\\nthey are being injected with.\\n\\nEven if they are told they are being injected with a drug\\n\\nthat has completely different effects than Sumitriptan.\\n\\nSo why would this be?\\n\\nHow could this be?\\n\\nIn fact, there was even a condition\\n\\nin which subjects were told\\n\\non the day they received the placebo,\\n\\nyou're about to get an injection of something\\n\\nthat's going to decrease growth hormone,\\n\\nbut rather they experienced a genuine increase\\n\\nin growth hormone and decrease in cortisol\\n\\nin the exact same way they did\\n\\nwhen they received the active drug Sumitriptan.\\n\\nOkay, so this wild type of scenario has to be explained.\\n\\nAnd in order to explain it,\\n\\nwe need to zoom out from the experiment\\n\\nand ask what's the similarity\\n\\nbetween day two and three of the experiment,\\n\\nmeaning the days in which the people received\\n\\nthe actual active drug Sumitriptan\\n\\nthat increases growth hormone, reduces cortisol,\\n\\nand the day in which they received the placebo.\\n\\nAnd the one thing that anchors both those days together,\\n\\nmeaning the one thing in common\\n\\nthat can explain this effect\\n\\nis that those were the days\\n\\nin which people received an injection.\\n\\nAnd in fact, through various control experiments\\n\\nand a few other experiments that were done subsequent to this\\n\\nbecause this experiment has been more or less repeated\\n\\nin different forms, in different laboratories,\\n\\nit became clear that the brain and body\\n\\nsomehow came to expect that receiving an injection\\n\\nleads to increases in growth hormone and cortisol.\\n\\nNow, this is not an indefinite effect, right?\\n\\nPeople will get injections of other things in the future,\\n\\npresumably active drugs, not just saline,\\n\\nthat will change hormone levels\\n\\nor change neurotransmitter levels.\\n\\nBut in this experiment, what happened is,\\n\\nis that there was a pairing within the nervous system.\\n\\nThere was somehow a binding of the notion\\n\\nof getting an injection with a syringe,\\n\\nwhich in the first case was of a drug\\n\\nthat increases growth hormone, decreases cortisol.\\n\\nAnd then when subjects came back\\n\\nand were injected with a different syringe,\\n\\npresumably, I would hope so,\\n\\nwith a different syringe filled with saline,\\n\\neven though the saline should do nothing,\\n\\nthe body and brain had somehow formed a pairing,\\n\\nan association between syringe injection\\n\\nand increased growth hormone, decreased cortisol,\\n\\nwhich is incredible given that these systems,\\n\\nthe anterior pituitary, the adrenal glands,\\n\\nI mean, these are ancient systems that, to our knowledge,\\n\\nwe can't directly control with our mind.\\n\\nI can't simply close my eyes and grit my teeth\\n\\nand cause the release of growth hormone.\\n\\nI can't simply decide to deploy cortisol from my adrenals,\\n\\nalthough if I thought about something very, very stressful\\n\\nfor a long time, there'd probably be\\n\\nsome cortisol secretion.\\n\\nBut to our knowledge, there is no way to use thoughts,\\n\\nto use beliefs, to use understanding of knowledge\\n\\nto cause changes in our endocrine glands, right?\\n\\nOur hormone glands, the pituitary, the adrenals.\\n\\nBut here we have a case where a drug\\n\\nthat increases certain hormones\\n\\nand decreases other hormones,\\n\\nsimply by virtue of the fact that it was injected\\n\\ninto somebody leads to a case where subsequent injections,\\n\\nat least in the short run,\\n\\nlead to the exact same hormone changes,\\n\\nsimply because in the mind and or body of these individuals,\\n\\ninjection comes to equal increase in growth hormone,\\n\\ndecrease in cortisol, independent of what's being injected.\\n\\nNow, a key point is that had on the final day\\n\\nof the experiment, the subject's been injected\\n\\nwith a different drug that, for instance,\\n\\nincreases serotonin or reduces epinephrine.\\n\\nI doubt that they would have instead experienced increases\\n\\nin growth hormone and reductions in cortisol.\\n\\nThat's simply not the case.\\n\\nThe fact that there was only saline in there\\n\\nmeant that there was an opportunity\\n\\nfor the syringe and the injection, we don't know which,\\n\\nto lead to some sort of paired association\\n\\nin the brain and body that led to increased growth hormone,\\n\\ndecreased cortisol, which mimicked the drug effect.\\n\\nBut the whole scenario here, as wild as it is,\\n\\nreally speaks to the fact that oftentimes\\n\\nwe think a given treatment is causing a given effect\\n\\nonly because of the action of the drug\\n\\nor the action of a given behavioral protocol.\\n\\nBut in fact, the drug and the protocol exist\\n\\nin a big context of different things\\n\\nthat the brain and body are integrating\\n\\nand trying to make sense of.\\n\\nAnd that often gets lumped together.\\n\\nI often say that your brain is, yes, a prediction machine,\\n\\nbut it's also trying to simplify things\\n\\nin those predictions.\\n\\nIt's not taking into account all the information.\\n\\nIt's often lumping information together\\n\\nand coming up with ideas about what's going to happen\\n\\nand why, and doing this subconsciously\\n\\nin a way that, as you just learned,\\n\\ncan have profound effects on what happens within us,\\n\\neven at the level of something as basic as hormone release.\\n\\nNow, what I just described is a pretty extreme example,\\n\\nand it's a very experimental condition type example.\\n\\nI mean, it's rare that people are undergoing\\n\\nthese kinds of organized receivable of information\\n\\nfollowed by specific drug treatments\\n\\nand placebo injections, et cetera.\\n\\nBut you've all experienced the placebo effect in action\\n\\nby way of what's called classical conditioning,\\n\\nsimply by virtue of the fact\\n\\nthat the smells of certain foods\\n\\nand your past experience of certain foods\\n\\ncan lead to the release of a hormone called insulin.\\n\\nInsulin is a hormone that is involved\\n\\nin regulating blood glucose, blood sugar.\\n\\nAnd typically, when insulin levels go up\\n\\nin the bloodstream, glucose levels are going to go down\\n\\nbecause of the way the insulin controls blood sugar levels.\\n\\nNow, if you've ever had the experience\\n\\nof walking past a bakery or a pizza shop\\n\\nwhere a delicious smell is wafting out into the environment,\\n\\nyou may notice that it, quote unquote, makes you hungry.\\n\\nAnd indeed, it does make you hungry\\n\\nbecause presumably you've had the experience\\n\\nof certain smells being associated\\n\\nwith the consuming of certain foods,\\n\\nmaybe bakery foods, maybe pizza, maybe steak,\\n\\nwhatever it is.\\n\\nAnd the consumption of those foods\\n\\nactually leads to increases in insulin in your bloodstream.\\n\\nWell, there's the so-called conditioning effect\\n\\nwhereby the smell of the food itself\\n\\nstarts to lead to increases in insulin.\\n\\nBut the conditioning effects of different stimuli,\\n\\ndifferent things in the context of eating\\n\\nand specific foods leading to increases in insulin\\n\\nis actually highly, highly modifiable,\\n\\nso much so that experiments have been done\\n\\nwhere, for instance, somebody eats a particular food\\n\\nor in some cases is just directly injected with insulin,\\n\\nbut more often consumes a particular food.\\n\\nAnd just prior to consuming or during consuming that food,\\n\\nthere's a bell ringing or a buzzer\\n\\nin the background going off.\\n\\nAnd they do that a few times.\\n\\nAnd then, I'm sure you're anticipating what's coming,\\n\\nsomebody can just hear the buzzer\\n\\nor the bell can simply ring\\n\\nand that person will experience an increase in insulin.\\n\\nSo what I'm describing is a conditioned insulin response.\\n\\nA stimulus such as a bell or a buzzer\\n\\nthat on its own should have zero effect on insulin release\\n\\nhas been paired with a food\\n\\nthat genuinely increases insulin within the bloodstream.\\n\\nAnd then even if the food isn't present,\\n\\nthe stimulus, the buzzer, the bell, et cetera,\\n\\ncan evoke the insulin response.\\n\\nNow, this is an important example to understand\\n\\nbecause it's a common one that we've presumably\\n\\nall experienced and that exists within the wiring\\n\\nof our brain right now.\\n\\nBut it's different than the smell\\n\\nevoking the insulin response\\n\\nbecause delicious food which evokes an insulin response,\\n\\nhaving a particular odor,\\n\\nthat makes sense in the context of food.\\n\\nBut here we're talking about something\\n\\ncompletely unrelated to the food,\\n\\nnot the odor, not the taste, not the appearance,\\n\\njust something that happened to be in the environment\\n\\nin which you ate the food,\\n\\nleading to an increase in insulin.\\n\\nAnd it just screams placebo effect,\\n\\nbut it also screams that the placebo effect\\n\\nis strongly modifiable according to context.\\n\\nAgain, the prefrontal cortex being the seat\\n\\nof the anticipation or placebo effect\\n\\nand the prefrontal cortex taking into account\\n\\nlots of things in the environment,\\n\\ntrying to understand what's here, what sounds,\\n\\nwhat smells, what colors,\\n\\nand then lumping all of that together\\n\\nand eventually through the activation\\n\\nof specific neural circuits,\\n\\nleading to a very basic hormonal response,\\n\\nin this case, the release of insulin.\\n\\nAnd of course, what I just described\\n\\nis classical conditioning a la Pavlov.\\n\\nPavlov won the Nobel Prize\\n\\nfor his description of classical conditioning\\n\\nin which dogs could be induced to salivate\\n\\nin anticipation of food by way of a stimulus\\n\\ncompletely unrelated to food itself,\\n\\nnot the smell, not the look, not the taste,\\n\\nrather just a bell rung before the consumption of food\\n\\nin a dog eventually led to a situation\\n\\nwhere the mere ringing of a bell\\n\\ncould evoke salivation from those dogs.\\n\\nSo are we all just like salivating dogs?\\n\\nI guess we are.\\n\\nI'd like to take a brief moment\\n\\nand thank one of our sponsors, and that's AG1.\\n\\nAG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\\n\\nthat also contains adaptogens.\\n\\nI started taking AG1 way back in 2012.\\n\\nThe reason I started taking it\\n\\nand the reason I still take it every day\\n\\nis that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas\\n\\nfor vitamins and minerals,\\n\\nand it ensures that I get enough prebiotic and probiotic\\n\\nto support gut health.\\n\\nNow, gut health is something that over the last 10 years,\\n\\nwe realized is not just important for the health of our gut,\\n\\nbut also for our immune system\\n\\nand for the production of neurotransmitters\\n\\nand neuromodulators, things like dopamine and serotonin.\\n\\nIn other words, gut health is critical\\n\\nfor proper brain functioning.\\n\\nNow, of course, I strive to consume healthy whole foods\\n\\nfor the majority of my nutritional intake every single day,\\n\\nbut there are a number of things in AG1,\\n\\nincluding specific micronutrients\\n\\nthat are hard to get from whole foods\\n\\nor at least in sufficient quantities.\\n\\nSo AG1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals\\n\\nthat I need, probiotics, prebiotics, the adaptogens,\\n\\nand critical micronutrients.\\n\\nSo anytime somebody asks me\\n\\nif they were to take just one supplement,\\n\\nwhat that supplement should be, I tell them AG1,\\n\\nbecause AG1 supports so many different systems\\n\\nwithin the body that are involved in mental health,\\n\\nphysical health, and performance.\\n\\nTo try AG1, go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman,\\n\\nand you'll get a year's supply of vitamin D3K2\\n\\nand five free travel packs of AG1.\\n\\nAgain, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nOkay, so given that context is a powerful modifier\\n\\nof the placebo effect,\\n\\nand in fact may be central to the placebo effect,\\n\\nI just want to rattle off a few of the known placebo effects\\n\\nthat have been demonstrated,\\n\\nwhich show the extent to which your brain and my brain\\n\\nare coming up with ideas about what given drugs\\n\\nor given behavioral treatments ought to do,\\n\\nand in that way, shaping what happens\\n\\nwhen you take a placebo.\\n\\nOr, and this is an idea that we'll go into\\n\\nin a bit more detail in a few minutes,\\n\\nperhaps context is also changing the way\\n\\nthat active drugs, not placebos, but active drugs\\n\\nare impacting your brain and body.\\n\\nThe examples I'd like to give are from laboratory studies\\n\\nabout the placebo effect,\\n\\nbut that relate to very common at home\\n\\nand normal life scenarios, okay?\\n\\nThey are not unique to the laboratory,\\n\\nand they are the following.\\n\\nFirst of all, placebo effects are strongly modifiable\\n\\nby the expectation of the quality of a given treatment.\\n\\nFor instance, if you are given a placebo\\n\\nthat has a brand name on it,\\n\\nor a name of a drug, it could even be a made-up name,\\n\\nyou don't know what the drug does,\\n\\nbut it has trademark TM there in the corner of the name,\\n\\nso brand name as opposed to generic placebo,\\n\\nthe brand name placebo has a stronger effect.\\n\\nMoreover, if a placebo is placed into a package,\\n\\nnot just put in front of you on a little tray\\n\\nor in a little dish, but rather in a package\\n\\nwhere you have to push it through that little foil wrapping,\\n\\nor you have to take it out of a bottle,\\n\\nand especially if that wrapping or bottle has a label on it,\\n\\nor it looks as if it's a quote unquote real drug,\\n\\nwell, then the placebo has an even greater placebo effect.\\n\\nThe color of a given drug can even have an effect\\n\\nbased on our association or expectation\\n\\nof what different colors relate to\\n\\nin terms of our physiology.\\n\\nFor instance, if subjects are given pills\\n\\nthat they are told will help them fall and stay asleep,\\n\\nand some subjects are given blue pills,\\n\\nother subjects are given red pills,\\n\\nother subjects are given yellow pills,\\n\\nthe subjects that take the blue pills tend to sleep better,\\n\\neven though all the pills, regardless of color, are placebo.\\n\\nThey contain no active substance.\\n\\nOkay, so for some reason,\\n\\nmost people associate the color blue with sleep,\\n\\nwhereas, or I should say by contrast,\\n\\nif people are given a blue, a red, or a yellow pill,\\n\\nand they are told it's a stimulant,\\n\\nthe subjects taking the red pill,\\n\\nhere I mean the actual literal red pill.\\n\\nI'm not talking about any kind of cultural red pill.\\n\\nI haven't seen the matrix yet.\\n\\nPeople tell me I need to see it,\\n\\nbut I'm not talking about taking the red pill,\\n\\nquote unquote, I'm talking about taking a pill\\n\\nthat is the color red in an experiment.\\n\\nThe people that take that pill\\n\\nexperience a greater placebo-induced stimulant effect\\n\\nas opposed to when subjects take a blue or a yellow pill.\\n\\nFor some reason, the color red is associated\\n\\nwith a, quote unquote, upper effect or stimulant effect.\\n\\nMoreover, if subjects are given a blue, a red,\\n\\nor a yellow pill,\\n\\nand they are told that the pill\\n\\nwill have an antidepressant effect,\\n\\nthe subjects that took the yellow placebo\\n\\nget the biggest antidepressant effect.\\n\\nSo color of a given pill even impacts the direction\\n\\nor in this case, the magnitude of the placebo effect.\\n\\nAnd I should mention then every one of those studies,\\n\\nyes, there was information\\n\\nabout what the given pill should do.\\n\\nIt was not the case that if people took the red pill,\\n\\nthey felt a stimulant effect.\\n\\nIf they took a blue pill, they felt a sleepy effect.\\n\\nAnd if they took the yellow pill,\\n\\nthey felt an antidepressant effect.\\n\\nThese were three separate experiments,\\n\\none on sleep where subjects were given\\n\\none of the three colors of pills.\\n\\nBlue had the strongest effect.\\n\\nOr a study of stimulant effects.\\n\\nThey were told it's a study of pills\\n\\nthat will increase alertness and attention.\\n\\nThey were given one of three different colors.\\n\\nThe red pills had the biggest effect.\\n\\nAnd the third experiment,\\n\\nsubjects were told this is a pill\\n\\nthat will alleviate to some degree,\\n\\nyour symptoms of depression.\\n\\nThe people who took the yellow pill\\n\\nexperienced the greatest relief of depressive symptoms.\\n\\nNow that's pretty wild,\\n\\nbut what perhaps is even wilder\\n\\nis the more invasive a placebo intervention is,\\n\\nthe greater the placebo effect.\\n\\nSo capsules have a bigger effect than tablets.\\n\\nI don't know if that's more invasive,\\n\\nbut I guess it looks more medicinal\\n\\nto have a capsule versus a tablet.\\n\\nWho knows why, but that's what's been observed.\\n\\nAn injection of a placebo has a greater effect\\n\\nthan a consumption of a capsule or a tablet, of course.\\n\\nAnd if people are placed into a medical device or machine,\\n\\nespecially in cases where one of their limbs\\n\\nor both of their limbs,\\n\\nor even their whole body is placed into a device,\\n\\neven though the device is doing absolutely nothing\\n\\nspecifically to our biological system,\\n\\nit is inert, right?\\n\\nA bunch of buttons and a bunch of noises\\n\\nand a bunch of humming as if something were happening,\\n\\nbut nothing is happening that directly relates\\n\\nto any one specific biological system,\\n\\nexcept, and now you know what I'm about to say,\\n\\nexcept expectation of what the machine is doing.\\n\\nWell, that has the greatest placebo effect of all.\\n\\nSo for some reason, as the level of invasiveness\\n\\nor the, let's just say the complexity\\n\\nof a given treatment is increased,\\n\\nwell, then the magnitude of the placebo effect\\n\\nis also increased.\\n\\nAnd what this tells us is that the human brain\\n\\nhas come to associate level of invasiveness,\\n\\nlevel of complexity of a given treatment or machine\\n\\nto equate to bigger outcomes.\\n\\nAnd in some sense, that's completely logical,\\n\\nbut again, we have to remember,\\n\\nin absolutely zero of these conditions,\\n\\nwhether or not it's a tablet, a capsule,\\n\\nan injection or a medical device,\\n\\nis there anything being done to these human subjects\\n\\nthat impacts a specific biological function except one?\\n\\nAnd that one, again, is the activation\\n\\nof specific neural circuits in the prefrontal cortex\\n\\nthat then are able to communicate\\n\\nwith other areas of the brain and body\\n\\nthrough bona fide biological mechanisms\\n\\nof neurotransmitter release and electrical activity\\n\\nin neurons, this is what the brain does.\\n\\nAnd of course, the prefrontal cortex being part of the brain,\\n\\nthose are the mechanisms it employs\\n\\nto change the activity of hormone releasing glands,\\n\\nto change the activity of other neurons.\\n\\nIn other words, the belief effects,\\n\\nthe expectations are real.\\n\\nThey are having effects through true biological circuitry.\\n\\nIt's just that the pills and the treatments\\n\\nand the machines are not doing anything specific at all\\n\\nexcept activating expectation.\\n\\nSo we've been talking about the placebo effect\\n\\nand I've been giving examples of strong placebo effects.\\n\\nAnd while all of what I told you is substantiated by data,\\n\\nI do not want to give you the impression\\n\\nthat the placebo effect is limitless\\n\\nbecause it is not limitless.\\n\\nFor instance, placebos have been used to help\\n\\nin the treatment of cancer,\\n\\nbut their effects within the treatment of cancer\\n\\nare limited to a very specific set of symptoms and contexts.\\n\\nSo for instance, people who are told a given drug\\n\\nwill help them with their cancer\\n\\nby reducing their symptoms of chemotherapy\\n\\nor radiation therapy,\\n\\noften experience reductions in the negative symptoms\\n\\nof chemotherapy or radiation therapy,\\n\\nreduced pain, reduced nausea,\\n\\nand by consequence, improved feelings of wellbeing\\n\\ncompared to people who do not receive the placebo\\n\\nand who are not told, hey, this drug,\\n\\nwhich in reality is a placebo,\\n\\nis going to help you with your treatment.\\n\\nIt's going to make it less uncomfortable.\\n\\nOkay, so in the context of cancer treatment,\\n\\na placebo can reduce the discomfort\\n\\nof various cancer treatments.\\n\\nHowever, placebos cannot reduce the size\\n\\nor eliminate tumors.\\n\\nIf people who unfortunately have tumors,\\n\\nokay, cancer, are given a placebo\\n\\nand told this drug, which actually is a placebo,\\n\\nunbeknownst to them,\\n\\nis going to reduce the size of your tumors\\n\\nor eliminate your tumors,\\n\\nthat placebo is not effective in reducing the size\\n\\nor eliminating those tumors.\\n\\nThis is very important to understand\\n\\nbecause as you recall,\\n\\nplacebo effects are expectation effects.\\n\\nExpectation effects are driven in large part\\n\\nby the prefrontal cortex and its connectivity\\n\\nto other areas of the brain and thereby to the body,\\n\\nbut the outputs of the prefrontal cortex are limited.\\n\\nThere are a certain number of them,\\n\\nand indeed, there are many of them,\\n\\nbut those connections do not extend to tumors themselves\\n\\nor biological systems or circuitries\\n\\nthat allow one's beliefs to reduce the size of\\n\\nor eliminate tumors.\\n\\nAnd this is very important because, unfortunately,\\n\\nthere are many sufferers of cancer,\\n\\nand there are many theories\\n\\nabout accelerating the treatment of\\n\\nor improving the treatment of,\\n\\nor even curing cancer using so-called mind-body techniques\\n\\nor mind-body tools.\\n\\nAnd we need to be fair to the data\\n\\nwhich have conclusively shown that reductions in stress,\\n\\nimprovements in sleep, social support,\\n\\na number of things can improve cancer treatment outcomes.\\n\\nNow, those are not placebo effects.\\n\\nThose are all practices for which we know\\n\\nthere are reductions in inflammation,\\n\\nreductions in stress hormones\\n\\nthat lead to improved outcomes\\n\\nin the context of radiation therapy,\\n\\nin the context of immunotherapy,\\n\\nin the context of any bona fide treatments\\n\\nknown to reduce tumor size.\\n\\nSo what we need to do is separate out three things here.\\n\\nBehavioral practices, such as meditation, sleep,\\n\\nsocial support, known to reduce inflammation and stress,\\n\\nand that can improve cancer outcomes.\\n\\nThose are not placebo effects.\\n\\nThose are real effects.\\n\\nThere are also drugs, radiation, chemotherapy,\\n\\nimmunotherapy, and devices known to reduce tumor size\\n\\nand hopefully eliminate cancerous tumors.\\n\\nThat would be the hope.\\n\\nThose are real effects.\\n\\nAnd then there are the placebo effects,\\n\\nthe knowledge and belief and expectation\\n\\nabout what a given treatment will do,\\n\\nin some cases, it's knowledge\\n\\nabout what a given drug will do\\n\\nthat improves the outcome achieved with that drug.\\n\\nIn some cases, it's people being given\\n\\na completely inert substance or solution\\n\\nlike saline solution, but being told\\n\\nthis is going to help with your nausea symptoms,\\n\\nthis is going to help with your pain\\n\\nduring your immunotherapy, radiation, et cetera.\\n\\nAnd those are real effects,\\n\\nbut they can only be explained\\n\\nby virtue of expectation and knowledge,\\n\\nAKA placebo effects.\\n\\nAnd I want to emphasize that those placebo effects\\n\\nare not acting directly on tumors\\n\\nto reduce their size or eliminate them.\\n\\nAnother example of how placebo effects\\n\\ncan be very powerful and yet still have limits to them\\n\\nis yet another study from Dr. Ted Kaptchuk's lab\\n\\nat Harvard Medical School.\\n\\nAnd by the way, many, not all of the studies\\n\\nthat I've been describing today\\n\\nhave been done by the Kaptchuk lab.\\n\\nHe's done beautiful work on placebo effects\\n\\nfor a very long time now.\\n\\nHe's considered a real pioneer\\n\\nand a leader in the study of placebo.\\n\\nAnd he's also been a big proponent\\n\\nof exploring the placebo effect,\\n\\nnot simply as a contrast to drug effects or device effects,\\n\\nbut as their own specific effect\\n\\nthat perhaps can be leveraged\\n\\nin the context of treating disease.\\n\\nSo hats off, literally plural hats off\\n\\nbecause they've had oh, so many discoveries\\n\\nin the context of placebo and their powerful effects\\n\\nand their possible uses from the Kaptchuk lab\\n\\nand their colleagues there at Harvard Medical School.\\n\\nJust incredible work.\\n\\nAnd one of my favorite studies from the Kaptchuk lab\\n\\nis one published in the New England Journal of Medicine\\n\\nsome years ago in which they took people who had asthma.\\n\\nSo these are people diagnosed with asthma.\\n\\nThese are people who have challenges breathing\\n\\nand they experience a lot of discomfort\\n\\nin trying to breathe normally\\n\\nunless they are taking their asthma medication.\\n\\nIn this study,\\n\\nthey took people off of their asthma medication,\\n\\nof course not indefinitely, but for a short period of time.\\n\\nAnd as expected,\\n\\nthose people experienced challenges in breathing\\n\\nand discomfort associated with the challenges in breathing.\\n\\nOne group received no treatment.\\n\\nThey were just taken off their asthma meds and evaluated.\\n\\nAnd then of course, put back on their asthma meds.\\n\\nAnother group received a placebo treatment\\n\\nand another group received a drug\\n\\nknown to improve the symptoms of asthma.\\n\\nNow, what was interesting\\n\\nis that the people who received the drug\\n\\nfor the treatment of asthma, not surprisingly,\\n\\nhad improvements in breathing and less discomfort.\\n\\nExactly what you'd expect.\\n\\nHowever, the people with placebo\\n\\nalso experienced less discomfort in breathing,\\n\\nbut their patterns of breathing didn't change.\\n\\nSo again, this really speaks to the fact\\n\\nthat placebo effects can be very powerful,\\n\\nbut that they're very specific.\\n\\nThey are not simply wiping out a condition like asthma\\n\\nor completely eliminating all symptomology\\n\\nof a given condition like cancer.\\n\\nThis study illustrates very clearly\\n\\nthat placebo is effective in reducing the discomfort\\n\\nassociated with the challenges of breathing,\\n\\nbut not eliminating challenges with breathing per se.\\n\\nWhereas, as I mentioned before,\\n\\nthere are drugs, bona fide prescription drug treatments\\n\\nthat can both restore normal patterns of breathing\\n\\nand relieve the discomfort.\\n\\nSo what this really speaks to is the fact\\n\\nthat the prefrontal cortex\\n\\nand its involvement and expectation\\n\\ncan have powerful effects on things like pain,\\n\\npowerful effects on things like dopamine,\\n\\npowerful effects on any number\\n\\nof different brain and body systems,\\n\\nbut not all of them.\\n\\nOur beliefs and expectations are powerful\\n\\nas evidenced by the placebo effect itself,\\n\\nbut they are not what we call omnipotent.\\n\\nThey can't do anything and everything.\\n\\nI'd

understand your body\\n\\nand help you reach your health goals.\\n\\nI've long been a believer in getting\\n\\nregular blood work done for the simple reason\\n\\nthat many of the factors that impact your immediate\\n\\nand long-term health can only be analyzed\\n\\nfrom a quality blood test.\\n\\nA major problem with a lot of blood tests out there,\\n\\nhowever, is that you get information back\\n\\nabout metabolic factors, lipids and hormones and so forth,\\n\\nbut you don't know what to do with that information.\\n\\nWith InsideTracker, they make it very easy\\n\\nbecause they have a personalized platform\\n\\nthat allows you to see the levels of all those things,\\n\\nmetabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera,\\n\\nbut it gives you specific directives that you can

favorite studies\\n\\nin the context of placebo is a paper\\n\\nthat was published pretty recently,\\n\\nand the title of this paper is\\n\\nNicotine-Related Beliefs Induce Dose-Dependent Responses\\n\\nin the Human Brain.\\n\\nAnd if ever there was a paper that pointed to the fact\\n\\nthat our belief systems can really shape the way\\n\\nthat different drugs, different supplements,\\n\\ndifferent behavioral protocols can impact the way\\n\\nthat our physiology and our brain work, it's this paper.\\n\\nIt's a pretty straightforward study.\\n\\nIt was, of course, carried out in humans.\\n\\nAnd what they did is they had people vape nicotine.\\n\\nNicotine is a known cognitive enhancer.\\n\\nNicotine, so named because it binds\\n\\nto nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain,\\n\\nwhich is just fancy nerd speak,\\n\\nfor the receptors, the little parking spots,\\n\\nfor acetylcholine, a neuromodulator\\n\\nthat's involved in a tension,\\n\\nand by virtue of being involved in a tension,\\n\\nis critical for the performance of certain focused tasks.\\n\\nOkay, so most people associate nicotine with smoking,\\n\\nvaping, dipping, or snuffing.\\n\\nHere, we're talking about nicotine that's vaped.\\n\\nHowever, I want to be very clear.\\n\\nI am not encouraging people to vape nicotine.\\n\\nYes, vaping is probably healthier for you than smoking,\\n\\nbut vaping is not good for you.\\n\\nIt would be better to not vape than to vape at all.\\n\\nI did an entire episode about nicotine.\\n\\nSo I want to leave aside the issue\\n\\nof whether or not you decide to use nicotine.\\n\\nOkay, that's all covered in the episode on nicotine.\\n\\nI'll provide a link to that in the show note captions.\\n\\nThere's a lot of considerations there.\\n\\nIt does increase blood pressure\\n\\nand it increases vasoconstriction and on and on,\\n\\nbut as I mentioned, nicotine is a cognitive enhancer.\\n\\nIt can increase focus and attention,\\n\\nand in doing so, it can allow your brain\\n\\nto do certain things better, like task switching,\\n\\nlike focusing in the context of a lot of distraction,\\n\\net cetera, et cetera.\\n\\nSo in this study, nicotine-related beliefs\\n\\ninduce dose-dependent responses in the human brain.\\n\\nSubjects used a vape to ingest nicotine,\\n\\nand they were told that they were either ingesting\\n\\na low, medium, or high concentration of nicotine.\\n\\nAnd a really nice thing about this study\\n\\nis that they actually measured\\n\\nhow much nicotine people vaped.\\n\\nSo they were able to measure how much nicotine\\n\\nmade it into the bloodstreams of these people.\\n\\nAnd they were also able to evaluate brain activity\\n\\nin areas of the brain known to have\\n\\nthese nicotinic receptors and to also be involved\\n\\nin certain cognitive tasks.\\n\\nSo just to get to the grand conclusion of the study,\\n\\nwhat they found is that people who were told\\n\\nthat they ingested a high concentration\\n\\nor a medium concentration of nicotine\\n\\nperformed better on a cognitive task\\n\\nthat we know is dependent on or can be modified\\n\\nby the amount of acetylcholine transmission\\n\\nin a certain area of the brain,\\n\\nthen did individuals who were told\\n\\nthat they ingested a small concentration of nicotine.\\n\\nNow, the interesting part of the study\\n\\nis that everybody consumed the same amount of nicotine.\\n\\nSo here we have a situation\\n\\nwhere there is a so-called dose-dependent placebo effect.\\n\\nEveryone gets the same amount of nicotine,\\n\\nbut people are either told,\\n\\nmeaning they were lied to in some cases,\\n\\nthat they got a small, medium,\\n\\nor high concentration of nicotine.\\n\\nAnd for the group that was told\\n\\nthat they received a medium concentration of nicotine,\\n\\nthey performed better on a cognitive task\\n\\nthan did the people who were told\\n\\nthey received a smaller concentration of nicotine.\\n\\nMoreover, people who were told\\n\\nthat they received a high concentration of nicotine\\n\\nperformed better than either the individuals\\n\\nwho were told they received a medium\\n\\nor small concentration of nicotine.\\n\\nBut as I mentioned before,\\n\\neveryone received the same concentration of nicotine.\\n\\nSo this tells us that not only are placebo effects\\n\\nrelated to expectation,\\n\\nbut that the expectation somebody has\\n\\nof the degree of an effect they should experience\\n\\nactually creates a different level of experience.\\n\\nPut differently, if you're told\\n\\nthat you're getting a small amount of drug,\\n\\na medium amount of drug, or a high amount of drug,\\n\\nand that the size of an effect gets bigger\\n\\nas you go from small, medium, to high,\\n\\nwell, then you will experience the small, medium,\\n\\nor high effect, depending on which group you were in,\\n\\neven if you all got the same dose of drug.\\n\\nNow, I need to be very clear.\\n\\nEverybody got actual nicotine.\\n\\nThe placebo effect here is related\\n\\nto what people believed about the dose of nicotine they got,\\n\\nbut everyone got active nicotine.\\n\\nNow, here's where it gets really cool.\\n\\nAs I mentioned earlier, in this study,\\n\\nthey imaged the brains of people\\n\\nthat were in either the group that was told\\n\\nthey got a small or medium or high concentration of nicotine.\\n\\nAnd what they found is that in the specific area\\n\\nof the brain that is known to respond to nicotine\\n\\nand that is involved in cognitive functioning\\n\\nrelated to the task that these subjects were given,\\n\\nthey saw increased levels of activity of the neurons\\n\\nin that brain region that scaled up\\n\\naccording to whether or not people were told\\n\\nthey got a small, medium, or high amount of nicotine.\\n\\nAgain, everyone got the same amount of nicotine.\\n\\nThey were simply told small, medium, or high,\\n\\nand the brain area itself changed its level of activity,\\n\\nwhich in turn changed the outcome on the cognitive task,\\n\\nwhich basically puts everything in a really nice box,\\n\\nwraps it up with wrapping paper beautifully,\\n\\nputs it in a bow and says,\\n\\nokay, placebo effects are real,\\n\\nand placebo effects scale\\n\\nwith the degree of expectation that one has.\\n\\nSo anytime we are told that a small dose of something\\n\\nis going to lead to a small effect,\\n\\na medium dose of something\\n\\nis going to lead to a bigger effect,\\n\\nand a high dose will lead to an even higher effect,\\n\\nwell, whether or not that occurs\\n\\nis going to depend a lot on what sorts of,\\n\\nquote unquote, effects we are expecting.\\n\\nAgain, you can't use placebo to eliminate tumors.\\n\\nThere's a limit to what placebo effects can occur,\\n\\nbut assuming that the effect that one is interested in\\n\\nis modifiable by knowledge and expectation,\\n\\nwell, the size of that effect will scale\\n\\nwith how big you expect the effect to be,\\n\\nand it's not purely psychological.\\n\\nThat's the point here.\\n\\nIt's not just about your beliefs\\n\\nand you doing something very different\\n\\nin the context of a task or in a sports event,\\n\\nyour physiology, in this case,\\n\\nthe activity of a specific brain region\\n\\nincreases its level of output\\n\\naccording to your expectation\\n\\nof the level of drug you consumed.\\n\\nSo in my description of that recently published study,\\n\\nyou notice I said placebo effects,\\n\\nbut in many ways what I was describing were belief effects.\\n\\nIt's a little bit difficult to disentangle\\n\\nwhat's a placebo effect and what's a belief effect.\\n\\nIn general, belief effects have to do\\n\\nwith acquiring a bit more information\\n\\nor specificity of information\\n\\nabout what the expectation should be.\\n\\nSo I suppose the study I just described\\n\\ncould easily fall under the category of belief effects\\n\\nand not just placebo effects,\\n\\nbut nonetheless, belief effects are powerful,\\n\\nand they're especially powerful\\n\\nbecause as one starts to layer in different amounts\\n\\nand different types of information\\n\\nas to what a given drug treatment\\n\\nor behavioral treatment will do,\\n\\none can start to see really nuanced outcomes\\n\\nas well as truly surprising outcomes.\\n\\nAnd some of my favorite studies on belief effects\\n\\nwere done by my colleague at Stanford.\\n\\nShe's in the Department of Psychology.\\n\\nHer name is Dr. Aliyah Crumb.\\n\\nShe's been a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast before.\\n\\nWe will also provide a link to that episode.\\n\\nAnd Allie's lab studies mindsets.\\n\\nMindsets, of course, incorporate a lot of things\\n\\nbesides beliefs.\\n\\nThey involve prior knowledge.\\n\\nThey tend to have even more information woven into them\\n\\nthan either placebo effects or belief effects.\\n\\nBut Allie's really one of the world leaders\\n\\nin understanding these belief effects\\n\\nand has done some just gorgeous work\\n\\nin illustrating the incredible range\\n\\nand extent of belief effects that exist.\\n\\nOne of my favorite studies in this context\\n\\nis the paper from Allie's lab entitled\\n\\nMind Over Milkshakes.\\n\\nMindsets, not just nutrients,\\n\\ndetermine the ghrelin response.\\n\\nSo here I'll just briefly describe the study.\\n\\nI'll paraphrase the abstract.\\n\\nOn two separate occasions,\\n\\npeople consumed a 380 calorie milkshake\\n\\nand they were either told that it was a 620 calorie\\n\\nquote unquote indulgent shake\\n\\nor a 140 calorie quote unquote sensible shake.\\n\\nThen the hormone ghrelin was measured.\\n\\nGhrelin is a hormone associated with hunger.\\n\\nIt is released from and binds to various sites\\n\\nwithin the brain and body,\\n\\nbut it's generally associated with the hunger response,\\n\\nthe desire for food.\\n\\nThen their subjects had their blood drawn\\n\\nat three different time points.\\n\\nSo at baseline prior to consumption of the milkshake,\\n\\nanticipatory, meaning just prior to consuming the milkshake\\n\\nand post consumption,\\n\\n90 minutes after consuming the milkshake.\\n\\nAnd then ghrelin was measured within the blood samples\\n\\nthat the people provided.\\n\\nNow, as you recall,\\n\\neveryone is consuming the same 380 calorie shake,\\n\\nbut that's unbeknownst to them.\\n\\nOne group thinks they're drinking an indulgent shake\\n\\nthat has lots of calories.\\n\\nThe other group thinks they're ingesting\\n\\na quote unquote sensible shake with fewer calories.\\n\\nAnd it's important to note that in the study,\\n\\nthe individuals were asked to read the labels of the shake\\n\\nand get information about, okay, this is an indulgent shake.\\n\\nHas a lot of calories, a lot of fat, et cetera.\\n\\nIn the other case, this shake has very few calories.\\n\\nIt contains healthy ingredients, et cetera.\\n\\nNow you can probably guess where this is going.\\n\\nThe people that consumed the milkshake,\\n\\nbut we're told it was a high calorie indulgent shake\\n\\nand also, by the way, consumed information\\n\\nabout it being high calorie and indulgent,\\n\\nor they were reading that on the label,\\n\\nexperienced steeper reductions\\n\\nin this hunger associated hormone called ghrelin,\\n\\nas compared to the group\\n\\nthat also consumed the same 380 calorie shake,\\n\\nbut thought that the shake was a sensible shake\\n\\nwith fewer calories that was a healthier shake.\\n\\nThose people experienced reductions in ghrelin as well,\\n\\nbut they were less steep.\\n\\nThey occurred less quickly over time.\\n\\nAnd in addition, their subjective level of satiety,\\n\\nof fullness, or a feeling as if they had enough food\\n\\nto quell off hunger was also related to whether or not\\n\\nthey thought they had consumed\\n\\nthe higher calorie indulgent shake\\n\\nor the lower calorie sensible shake.\\n\\nThere are a bunch of other interesting aspects\\n\\nto this study.\\n\\nI'm just giving you a cursory overview of the major effects,\\n\\nbut the takeaway is very straightforward.\\n\\nWhat we believe about the foods we are consuming\\n\\nstrongly impacts the downstream hormonal effects\\n\\nof consuming those foods.\\n\\nGhrelin, after all, is a peptide hormone\\n\\nthat is secreted from the stomach, okay?\\n\\nYes, the stomach has neurons, but as far as we know,\\n\\nthe stomach doesn't have a little thinking brain in there.\\n\\nThe stomach is operating in a very kind of crude language\\n\\nof the nervous system as compared to the thinking\\n\\nand analytic language of the brain, the forebrain.\\n\\nBut what's happening here is that knowledge,\\n\\nindeed specific knowledge about what more calories means\\n\\nas opposed to fewer calories, what the word indulgent means\\n\\nas opposed to sensible, all of that is being combined\\n\\nand then communicating with neurons\\n\\nand other systems of the gut to literally create\\n\\na different hormonal response to food.\\n\\nAnd that's incredible because the hormonal response to food\\n\\nis a very strongly evolutionary conserved set of mechanisms.\\n\\nAnd yet this study and other studies like it,\\n\\nincluding the conditioned insulin response\\n\\nthat we talked about earlier, you know, Pavlov's dogs,\\n\\nor in this case, we are the Pavlov's dogs.\\n\\nWe're the ones that can get conditioned to a bell\\n\\nor the smell of a food or the sight of a sign on a bakery\\n\\nto get a insulin increase.\\n\\nAll of that stuff that is primitive, hard wiring\\n\\nof the brain and body is also being strongly impacted\\n\\nby the more, let's call it sophisticated\\n\\nor analytic aspects of the wiring of the brain,\\n\\nsuch as the prefrontal cortex,\\n\\nsuch that what we believe is going to happen\\n\\nis actually what happens.\\n\\nNow, the other study on belief effects and mindsets\\n\\nand how they can impact outcomes\\n\\nin terms of our physiology relates to exercise.\\n\\nAnd this is a study that Dr. Crumb herself\\n\\ndescribed Kim about because she was talking to\\n\\none of her academic advisors.\\n\\nThis was before she opened her own laboratory.\\n\\nAnd, you know, Alia is an athlete.\\n\\nShe was actually a division one athlete.\\n\\nShe's an incredibly impressive individual, by the way.\\n\\nShe's a tenured professor at Stanford.\\n\\nShe was a division one athlete.\\n\\nShe has a degree or rather a certification\\n\\nin clinical psychology.\\n\\nSo she's an extremely accomplished individual,\\n\\nbut exercise and athletics have always been\\n\\na big part of her life.\\n\\nAnd one day she was talking to her advisor\\n\\nand her advisor offered the possibility that,\\n\\nand here I'm paraphrasing from a different conversation,\\n\\nperhaps all the positive effects of exercise are placebo.\\n\\nThat's actually what her advisor said.\\n\\nAnd Ali said, no, there's no way, right?\\n\\nAnd we know that you exercise, you sure,\\n\\nget an increase in heart rate and blood pressure\\n\\nduring exercise, but that leads to lower levels\\n\\nof baseline blood pressure and heart rate afterwards\\n\\nafter you adapt to that exercise.\\n\\nAnd her advisor said, well, okay, that might be true,\\n\\nbut why don't you go test it?\\n\\nSo she did test it.\\n\\nWhat she did is she took hotel service workers.\\n\\nSo these are people that clean hotel rooms for a living.\\n\\nAnd these are very active people, right?\\n\\nThey're vacuuming, they're changing sheets,\\n\\nthey're going upstairs, they're folding laundry,\\n\\nthey're doing a bunch of different things\\n\\nthroughout the day.\\n\\nAnd they divided them into two groups.\\n\\nOne group was told that doing a great job\\n\\nand being diligent is very good for you.\\n\\nThey were told all sorts of things about their job\\n\\nand how it was important.\\n\\nAnd indeed, their job is important, right?\\n\\nWe need people who can perform these roles\\n\\nof turning over hotel rooms and doing those sorts of things\\n\\nso that hotel rooms can be clean and beautiful\\n\\nwhen we arrive.\\n\\nThe other group, however, was told\\n\\nthat the normal daily activities\\n\\nthat these people were partaking in,\\n\\nthe folding of the laundry, going up and down the stairs,\\n\\npushing of carts, et cetera, was exercise.\\n\\nAnd more importantly, that it was the type of movement\\n\\nthat could, for instance,\\n\\nlead to reductions in blood pressure,\\n\\nreductions in body weight,\\n\\nimprovements in lots of different health metrics.\\n\\nNow, the incredible outcome of this study\\n\\nwas that simply on the basis of whether or not\\n\\npeople were told and therefore believed\\n\\nthat their daily activities would lead to improvements\\n\\nin these different health metrics,\\n\\nreductions in blood pressure,\\n\\nreductions in basal heart rate,\\n\\nreductions in body weight.\\n\\nWell, that's exactly what happened.\\n\\nPeople who received the information\\n\\nabout how exercise was healthy\\n\\nand their work mimicked exercise\\n\\nexperienced the health metric changes.\\n\\nWhereas people who were simply told,\\n\\nyour work is important,\\n\\nit's important to do a good job, et cetera, et cetera,\\n\\nthey did not experience the same health metric improvements.\\n\\nSo that provides support\\n\\nfor what Dr. Crumb's advisor had suggested\\n\\nthat at least some of the effects of exercise\\n\\nare likely due to mindsets or beliefs, AKA belief effects.\\n\\nSo throughout today's episode,\\n\\nI've been talking about how our expectations and beliefs\\n\\nand mindsets can impact these really deep layers\\n\\nof our physiology, things like hormone release,\\n\\nthings like level of discomfort\\n\\nor pain during a given treatment and on and on.\\n\\nAnd I've talked a lot about the prefrontal cortex\\n\\nas critical for understanding what's happening\\n\\nin a given context and for setting those expectations\\n\\nbecause the prefrontal cortex, as you recall,\\n\\nis a prediction machine and context is important\\n\\nfor prediction and on and on.\\n\\nWhat I haven't yet told you is how it is\\n\\nthat the prefrontal cortex actually does this.\\n\\nI mean, what are these magical output pathways\\n\\nof the prefrontal cortex?\\n\\nAnd while I already established\\n\\nthat they are not infinite, right?\\n\\nThe prefrontal cortex can't control everything,\\n\\nmeaning if I give you some information like, you know,\\n\\njust thinking about and believing\\n\\nthat your left quadricep is going to be, you know,\\n\\nmuch stronger than your right quadricep.\\n\\nAnd if you just keep perseverating on,\\n\\nmeaning you keep thinking about that\\n\\nand looping on in your mind.\\n\\nAnd I give you some examples of how, you know,\\n\\nthinking about strength can make muscle stronger\\n\\nand on and on, you know,\\n\\nin the classic context of the placebo effect,\\n\\nall that expectation ought to lead to an improvement\\n\\nin strength and perhaps size of your left quadricep.\\n\\nBut that's not what happens.\\n\\nWhy, or more accurately, why not?\\n\\nWell, as far as we know,\\n\\nthere isn't a direct neural circuit or hormonal pathway\\n\\nwhereby thoughts from the prefrontal cortex\\n\\ncan impact the growth of muscles in your left quadricep.\\n\\nHowever, there are output pathways\\n\\nfrom the prefrontal cortex to regions of the brain\\n\\nthat are known to control very basic bodily\\n\\nand brain functions, such as the hypothalamus.\\n\\nAnd those pathways are known to be able to change\\n\\ncertain parameters of our, for instance, stress response.\\n\\nSo blood pressure, heart rate, vasoconstriction,\\n\\neven body temperature.\\n\\nSo I just want to take a moment and describe\\n\\nwhat I consider one of the more beautiful studies\\n\\nillustrating a specific pathway\\n\\nfrom the prefrontal cortex to the hypothalamus\\n\\nthat allows control of the so-called stress response\\n\\nin the context of very specific psychological stressors.\\n\\nNow, this paper is important,\\n\\nnot just for our discussion of placebo belief\\n\\nand mindset effects,\\n\\nbut also for any discussion\\n\\nabout so-called psychosomatic effects,\\n\\nor the idea that our modes of thinking,\\n\\nwhether or not they are related to calmness or to stress,\\n\\ncan strongly impact our physical health.\\n\\nAnd the title of the paper is\\n\\nA Central Master Driver\\n\\nof Psychosocial Stress Responses in the Rat.\\n\\nGoodness, that's a tongue twister.\\n\\nPsychosocial stress responses in the rat.\\n\\nNow, the fact that this study was performed in the rat\\n\\nshould not cause us to lean away from it\\n\\nor to think that it's not relevant to humans,\\n\\nbecause the very same circuitries\\n\\nthat are described within this study\\n\\nhave analogous circuitries within the human brain.\\n\\nI know that to be true from my work in neuroanatomy,\\n\\nteaching neuroanatomy, and other groups,\\n\\nseparate from the group that did this study,\\n\\nhave explored similar circuitries in the human brain.\\n\\nNow, in this study, what they were able to do\\n\\nwas to identify these two particular regions,\\n\\nwhich I'll just call them DPDTT for short.\\n\\nSo instead of saying dorsal peduncular cortex\\n\\nand dorsal tinea tecta,\\n\\nso just say DPDTT.\\n\\nThis is this area of the prefrontal cortex.\\n\\nOkay, don't let these acronyms and names scare you.\\n\\nThese are just names of a little subregion\\n\\nwithin the prefrontal cortex.\\n\\nSend connections, little wires that we call axons,\\n\\nto a area of the brain called the dorsal medial hypothalamus.\\n\\nThe dorsal medial hypothalamus\\n\\nis a highly conserved structure,\\n\\nmeaning whether or not you look in mouse or in rat\\n\\nor in apes or in humans or in dogs,\\n\\nthe dorsal medial hypothalamus contains neurons\\n\\nthat are involved in generating cardinal features\\n\\nof the stress response,\\n\\nthings like increased blood pressure,\\n\\nthings like increased vasoconstriction,\\n\\nthings like increased body temperature,\\n\\nthings like increased brown fat thermogenesis.\\n\\nNow, we can even go a step further\\n\\nbecause that's what they did in this study.\\n\\nThey mapped the connections\\n\\nfrom these specific subregions of the prefrontal cortex,\\n\\nthe DPDTT, down to the dorsal medial hypothalamus\\n\\nand a very specific set of neurons\\n\\nwithin the dorsal medial hypothalamus.\\n\\nBut even there, we're still in the brain.\\n\\nWe haven't yet established how activation\\n\\nof these specific neurons in the dorsal medial hypothalamus\\n\\nactually change blood pressure,\\n\\nhow they actually cause vasoconstriction in the periphery\\n\\nbecause that's what happens when you get very stressed,\\n\\nwhether or not it's from social stress or from cold water,\\n\\nthere's a constriction,\\n\\nwhat we call vasoconstriction in the periphery, right?\\n\\nBlood is shuttled toward the core of the body\\n\\nto keep your core organs alive.\\n\\nYou're still going to get blood to the big limbs\\n\\nof your body so you can move, run if you need to,\\n\\nbut your digits, your appendages are going to get\\n\\nfar less blood flow to them\\n\\nbecause of this vasoconstriction.\\n\\nAnd that's achieved by an output\\n\\nfrom the dorsal medial hypothalamus, okay?\\n\\nSo the second hub along this chain\\n\\nto an area of the brainstem\\n\\ncalled the rostral medullary raffae.\\n\\nOkay, again, fancy name.\\n\\nYou don't have to remember the name if you don't want to,\\n\\nmaybe you aficionados want to.\\n\\nBut what we're doing here is we're moving\\n\\nfrom the prefrontal cortex to the hypothalamus,\\n\\nthen to the brainstem, and then from the brainstem\\n\\nout to what we call the periphery, to the body,\\n\\nto the spinal cord, to the blood vessels themselves,\\n\\nto the organs of the body like the gut\\n\\nand the heart and the lungs,\\n\\nall the things that we associate\\n\\nwith the so-called stress response.\\n\\nSo as we've been learning about placebo effects\\n\\nand belief effects and mindset effects\\n\\nand learning that, okay, just our knowledge about something,\\n\\nour anticipation, our thinking can influence levels\\n\\nof a hunger hormone, isn't that wild?\\n\\nOr can influence the amount of pain that we experience\\n\\nin response to a cancer treatment,\\n\\nor can change the amount of dopamine in the brain\\n\\nin the context of a placebo given to people with Parkinson's.\\n\\nWell, all of that seems very, very surprising\\n\\nuntil you look at studies of the sort\\n\\nthat I've been describing in the last few minutes\\n\\nthat are starting to establish\\n\\nthe very precise neural circuitries\\n\\nthat lead from areas of the brain\\n\\nlike the prefrontal cortex that are associated\\n\\nwith thought and context and planning and prediction\\n\\ndown to, I don't want to call them the deeper\\n\\nor more primitive layers of the brain\\n\\nbecause these areas like the hypothalamus\\n\\nand the medulla, the brainstem,\\n\\nthey're not really primitive in the sense\\n\\nthat they do very sophisticated things.\\n\\nIt's just that they tend to be present\\n\\nin both mammals and reptiles, they're present in fish.\\n\\nWhereas the prefrontal cortex is a brain structure\\n\\nthat has undergone fairly significant elaboration\\n\\nas you move from animals like say cats, dogs,\\n\\nup to great apes and to humans.\\n\\nAnd at least to our knowledge\\n\\nas a field of neuroscientists and biologists,\\n\\nhumans have the most sophisticated\\n\\nor rather elaborate prefrontal cortex,\\n\\nthe most number of different sub areas\\n\\nof the prefrontal cortex.\\n\\nAnd every time there's an investigation of those sub areas,\\n\\nwhat they do, what their anatomies are,\\n\\nmeaning where they connect to and who connects back to them,\\n\\nit's found that there is a tremendous degree of specificity,\\n\\nall of which is to say that we shouldn't be surprised at all\\n\\nthat these placebo belief and mindset effects occur\\n\\nbecause there's a clear biological substrate for them.\\n\\nSo up until now, we've been talking\\n\\nabout the placebo effect as these incredible set of effects\\n\\nthat have a real biological substrate.\\n\\nThere are anatomical pathways, hormonal pathways,\\n\\nneurotransmitters involved, and that's all true.\\n\\nBut what's also true is that the placebo effect\\n\\ncan vary in size tremendously between individuals\\n\\nand across different studies.\\n\\nAnd in fact, this was described\\n\\nin the first formal study of the placebo effect.\\n\\nIn that study, it was shown that approximately 30%\\n\\nof the individuals in the study showed\\n\\na robust placebo effect,\\n\\nbut that the other 70% showed a less robust placebo effect.\\n\\nAnd that result, meaning that variation in susceptibility\\n\\nto the placebo effect has borne out again and again\\n\\nand again across different studies.\\n\\nNow, modern science has now taught us\\n\\nthat if you look at the genomes,\\n\\nthe genes that happen to be expressed\\n\\nin one individual versus the next\\n\\nversus the next versus the next,\\n\\nthere are certain genes, not a lot of them,\\n\\nbut there are certain genes that seem to correlate\\n\\nwith certain types of placebo effect\\n\\nbeing greater or lesser in certain individuals.\\n\\nAnd while there are a lot of these different genes\\n\\nand a lot of different placebo effects,\\n\\none of the more interesting ones is the COMT gene,\\n\\nwhich encodes for something called\\n\\ncatecholomethyltransferase, catecholomethyltransferase,\\n\\nas the name suggests, because it has an ace in there\\n\\nin the context of a discussion about biology\\n\\nthat almost always means you're talking about an enzyme.\\n\\nCatecholomethyltransferase is an enzyme\\n\\ninvolved in the regulation of the so-called catecholamines.\\n\\nCatecholamines being dopamine, epinephrine,\\n\\nand norepinephrine.\\n\\nOkay, we've already talked about dopamine\\n\\nin the context of Parkinson's.\\n\\nI've talked about dopamine a lot, frankly,\\n\\non the Huberman Lab podcast\\n\\nbecause it's involved in motivation,\\n\\nit's involved in focus, pursuit of reward,\\n\\nit's involved in movement, as we discussed earlier.\\n\\nNorepinephrine and epinephrine\\n\\nalso do many different things in the brain and body,\\n\\nbut not the least of which is to increase activation state\\n\\nfor heightened focus, for increasing the bias\\n\\ntoward movement of the body, and on and on.\\n\\nIn any event, this gene, COMT, catecholomethyltransferase,\\n\\nseems to show strong variation in individuals\\n\\nthat show strong variation in the placebo response\\n\\nto certain types of placebo conditions.\\n\\nAnd I just mention it because, A,\\n\\nI think it's super interesting.\\n\\nAfter all, a lot of the studies\\n\\nthat have demonstrated placebo effects\\n\\nhave shown those effects in the context\\n\\nof changes in dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.\\n\\nSo it's not without context\\n\\nthat we're talking about the COMT gene.\\n\\nBut also just as a general theme,\\n\\nthe fact that there are genes\\n\\nthat encode for specific biological substrates,\\n\\nin this case, regulation of dopamine, epinephrine,\\n\\nand norepinephrine,\\n\\nand those genes show up at different levels\\n\\nin different individuals,\\n\\nand the placebo effects show up at different levels\\n\\nin different individuals.\\n\\nAnd now there are studies that are starting to show\\n\\nthat the levels of those genes\\n\\nand the degree to which one experiences the placebo effect,\\n\\neither elevated response or reduced response\\n\\nto the placebo effect, seem to be fairly strongly correlated.\\n\\nSo this, again, is more evidence that, yes,\\n\\nthe placebo effect is based on knowledge,\\n\\nbelief, expectation,\\n\\nbut that it has a real biological substrate.\\n\\nJust as there are anatomical pathways\\n\\nout of the prefrontal cortex of the hypothalamus\\n\\ndown to the brainstem and out to the body,\\n\\nthere are also genes expressed in specific cells\\n\\nwithin our brain and body\\n\\nthat allow for our beliefs and expectations\\n\\nthat are carried through that prefrontal cortex circuitry\\n\\nto have either a greater or lesser effect.\\n\\nSo throughout today's episode,\\n\\nI've been talking about how knowledge,\\n\\nyour belief and understanding about what might happen\\n\\nought to happen or very likely will happen,\\n\\ninfluences whether or not that thing actually happens,\\n\\nthe so-called placebo effect\\n\\nor belief effect or mindset effect.\\n\\nAnd what I hope I've made clear\\n\\nduring the course of our discussion\\n\\nis that while placebo effects arrive\\n\\nthrough our cognitive understanding\\n\\nof what might, ought to, or is likely to happen,\\n\\nthe downstream effects, the effects on asthma,\\n\\nirritable bowel syndrome, insulin, growth hormone,\\n\\npick your favorite biological system.\\n\\nEssentially, every system within the brain and body\\n\\nhas been shown to be susceptible to placebo effects.\\n\\nWhat I hope is becoming clear is that in every case,\\n\\nthe placebo effect is a biological effect.\\n\\nIt's not just our thoughts\\n\\ntricking us into thinking something happened\\n\\nthat didn't happen.\\n\\nIt's our thoughts, our mind creating real biological effects.\\n\\nIf you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast,\\n\\nplease subscribe to our

       " Document(page_content='Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\n\\nwhere we discuss science\\n\\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\\n\\nI\\'m Andrew Huberman,\\n\\nand I\\'m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology\\n\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\n\\nToday, we are discussing aggression.\\n\\nI\\'m going to explain to you\\n\\nthat there are several different types of aggression.\\n\\nFor instance, reactive aggression\\n\\nversus proactive aggression,\\n\\nmeaning sometimes people will be aggressive\\n\\nbecause they feel threatened\\n\\nor they are protecting those\\n\\nthat they love who also feel threatened.\\n\\nThere\\'s also proactive aggression\\n\\nwhere people go out of their way\\n\\nto deliberately try and harm others.\\n\\nAnd there is indirect aggression,\\n\\nwhich is aggression not involving physical violence.\\n\\nFor instance, shaming people and things of that sort.\\n\\nIt turns out that there are different biological mechanisms\\n\\nunderlying each of the different types of aggression.\\n\\nAnd today, I will define those for you.\\n\\nI\\'ll talk about the neural circuits in the brain and body\\n\\nthat mediate each of the different kinds of aggression,\\n\\ntalk about some of the hormones and peptides\\n\\nand neurotransmitters involved.\\n\\nI promise to make it all accessible to you,\\n\\neven if you do not have any biology or science background.\\n\\nI will also discuss tools,\\n\\npsychological tools and biological tools\\n\\nthat one can use to better control aggression.\\n\\nNow, right here at the outset,\\n\\nI want to acknowledge that any discussion about aggression\\n\\nhas to have an element of context within it.\\n\\nTo be fair, human beings invest a lot of money,\\n\\na lot of time and a lot of energy,\\n\\nand indeed can even derive pleasure from aggression.\\n\\nLater, I\\'ll talk about neural circuits\\n\\nin the brain and body that reinforce,\\n\\nin other words, reward through the release of chemicals\\n\\nthat make people feel good, acts of aggression.\\n\\nHowever, what I\\'m mainly referring to\\n\\nis the context in which human beings will pay money\\n\\nin order to derive what we call vicarious aggression.\\n\\nPut it simply, people spend an enormous amount of money\\n\\nand time and energy watching other people engage in,\\n\\nfor instance, aggressive sports.\\n\\nAnd we know that observing your team winning\\n\\nover another team causes the release of neurochemicals\\n\\nin your brain and body that make you feel good,\\n\\nand yes, that can make you feel more aggressive.\\n\\nWe also know, of course,\\n\\nthat most governments invest many billions,\\n\\nif not trillions of dollars,\\n\\nin infrastructure technologies and human beings\\n\\nin order to engage in aggression if needed,\\n\\nso-called military warfare, et cetera.\\n\\nSo today\\'s discussion will include a description\\n\\nof aggression in the pathological sense.\\n\\nWe\\'ll actually talk about an explosive aggressive disorder\\n\\nthat most of you probably haven\\'t heard of,\\n\\nbut is actually far more common than perhaps you know.\\n\\nWe\\'ll talk about the role of things like\\n\\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder\\n\\nand how that can relate to aggression\\n\\nthrough the relationship between impulsivity and aggression.\\n\\nAnd we\\'ll talk about verbal aggression,\\n\\nphysical aggression, proactive aggression,\\n\\nas mentioned before, and reactive aggression.\\n\\nI\\'m certain that by the end of the episode,\\n\\nyou will come away with a much more thorough understanding\\n\\nof what this thing that we call aggression really is.\\n\\nAnd when you see it in other people,\\n\\nI think it will make more sense to you.\\n\\nAnd when you observe it in yourself\\n\\nor the impulse to engage in aggression,\\n\\nverbal or physical or otherwise,\\n\\nI hope that you\\'ll understand it better as well.\\n\\nAnd of course, the tools that I will describe\\n\\nshould allow you to modulate and control\\n\\naggressive tendencies or predispositions to aggressiveness\\n\\nand just generally to be able to engage with people\\n\\nin a more adaptive way overall.\\n\\nBefore we begin, I\\'d like to emphasize that this podcast\\n\\nis separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.\\n\\nIt is however, part of my desire and effort\\n\\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\\n\\nabout science and science related tools\\n\\nto the general public.\\n\\nIn keeping with that theme,\\n\\nI\\'d like to thank the sponsors of today\\'s podcast.\\n\\nOur first sponsor is Athletic Greens.\\n\\nAthletic Greens is an all-in-one\\n\\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink\\n\\nthat\\'s designed to meet all your foundational health needs.\\n\\nI started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012.\\n\\nSo I\\'m delighted that they\\'re sponsoring this podcast.\\n\\nThe reason I started taking Athletic Greens\\n\\nand the reason I still take Athletic Greens\\n\\nonce or twice a day is that it covers\\n\\nall of my basic vitamin, mineral and probiotic needs.\\n\\nThe probiotics are especially important to me.\\n\\nThere are now abundant data showing\\n\\nthat the gut microbiome, which is basically a community\\n\\nof trillions of little bacteria that live in our guts\\n\\nare beneficial for our immune system,\\n\\nfor brain function, for mood\\n\\nand many other aspects of our health.\\n\\nThe gut microbiome thrives on probiotics\\n\\nand Athletic Greens contains the proper array of probiotics\\n\\nto optimize the gut microbiome.\\n\\nAthletic Greens also has adaptogens for recovery\\n\\nfrom physical and mental exertion,\\n\\ndigestive enzymes for gut health, vitamin C, zinc,\\n\\nas I mentioned before, all the other vitamins and minerals\\n\\nthat you need in order to cover your basic needs each day.\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to try Athletic Greens,\\n\\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman\\n\\nand claim a special offer.\\n\\nThey\\'ll give you five free travel packs\\n\\nthat make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens\\n\\nwhile you\\'re on the road\\n\\nand a year supply of vitamin D3K2.\\n\\nThere\\'s now a wealth of data showing that vitamin D3\\n\\nis important for many aspects of our immediate\\n\\nand long-term health.\\n\\nMany people, even if they get out in the sunlight,\\n\\nare not getting enough vitamin D3\\n\\nand the K2 is thought to be beneficial\\n\\nfor calcium regulation\\n\\nand a number of other things important to our health.\\n\\nSo again, if you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,\\n\\nyou can claim the special offer of the five free travel packs\\n\\nand the year supply of vitamin D3K2.\\n\\nToday\\'s episode is also brought to us by Roca.\\n\\nRoca makes sunglasses and eyeglasses\\n\\nthat are of the absolute highest quality.\\n\\nThe company was founded by two all-American swimmers\\n\\nfrom Stanford and everything about their eyeglasses\\n\\nand sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.\\n\\nI\\'ve spent a lifetime working on the biology\\n\\nof the visual system.\\n\\nI can tell you that your visual system has to contend\\n\\nwith some pretty tough challenges\\n\\nas you move throughout the day.\\n\\nFor instance, if you go from a brightly lit region\\n\\nto a dimmer region, your visual system has to adjust.\\n\\nRoca eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed\\n\\nwith those sorts of adjustments in mind.\\n\\nSo for instance, if you\\'re outside in the shade,\\n\\nyou move into the sun and then back into the shade,\\n\\nyou don\\'t have to take your sunglasses on and off.\\n\\nTheir glasses were initially designed\\n\\nfor sports performance.\\n\\nAnd the great thing is they can be used for that,\\n\\nbut also they have a terrific aesthetic\\n\\nso you can wear them to work or out to dinner.\\n\\nI wear readers at night and when I drive at night\\n\\nand I wear sunglasses if I\\'m out a lot on really bright days.\\n\\nThe terrific thing about Roca glasses\\n\\nis that even if you get sweaty, they won\\'t fall off.\\n\\nSo you can run with them, you can cycle with them,\\n\\nor as I mentioned before,\\n\\nyou can just wear them out and about.\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to try Roca, you can go to roca.com,\\n\\nthat\\'s R-O-K-A.com and enter the code Huberman\\n\\nto save 20% off your first order.\\n\\nAgain, that\\'s roca, R-O-K-A.com\\n\\nand enter the code Huberman at checkout.\\n\\nToday\\'s episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.\\n\\nHelix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows\\n\\nthat in my opinion are the very best you\\'ll find.\\n\\nI started sleeping on a Helix mattress\\n\\na little over a year ago\\n\\nand it\\'s the best sleep I\\'ve had ever since.\\n\\nIf you go to the Helix site,\\n\\nthey have a terrific sleep quiz\\n\\nthat just takes a few minutes,\\n\\nasks you questions like,\\n\\ndo you tend to sleep on your side, your back or your stomach?\\n\\nMaybe you don\\'t know because you\\'re asleep,\\n\\nbut many people do know.\\n\\nAnd even if you don\\'t know, that\\'s okay.\\n\\nIt will also ask you questions like,\\n\\ndo you tend to run hot or cold?\\n\\nDo you tend to wake up in the middle of the night or not?\\n\\nAnd by taking that brief quiz,\\n\\nthey will match you to the specific mattress\\n\\nthat\\'s ideal for you and your sleep needs.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s really what sets Helix Sleep mattresses apart.\\n\\nEverybody\\'s unique and they know that.\\n\\nSo if you take this quiz,\\n\\nyou\\'ll get matched to a particular mattress.\\n\\nFor me, it was the Dusk mattress, D-U-S-K,\\n\\nbut again, that\\'s just me and you may match to that one\\n\\nor you may match to a different one.\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested in upgrading your mattress\\n\\nand sleeping much better,\\n\\ngo to helixsleep.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nTake that two minute sleep quiz\\n\\nand they\\'ll match you to a customized mattress\\n\\nand you\\'ll get up to $200 off any mattress order\\n\\nand two free pillows.\\n\\nI also love their pillows.\\n\\nI\\'ve always had this issue with pillows\\n\\nthat they heat up too much.\\n\\nI\\'m always looking for the pillow that can cool itself.\\n\\nSomehow the pillows stay nice and cool.\\n\\nThey\\'re also not too big, so they\\'re not propped up,\\n\\nnot getting the text neck in the middle of the night,\\n\\nbut I shouldn\\'t push my chest,\\n\\nnor am I falling back\\n\\nand having trouble breathing in the middle of the night.\\n\\nThey\\'re designed just right.\\n\\nThey also have a 10 years warranty\\n\\nand you get to try it out for 100 nights risk-free.\\n\\nThey\\'ll even pick it up for you if you don\\'t love it,\\n\\nbut I think that you will.\\n\\nAgain, if you\\'re interested,\\n\\nyou can go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman\\n\\nfor up to $200 off and two free pillows.\\n\\nLet\\'s talk about aggression.\\n\\nI think that many people out there are put off by aggression,\\n\\nalthough others are drawn to aggression,\\n\\nboth in themselves and when observing it in others.\\n\\nThe reason to talk about aggression is that,\\n\\nas mentioned before,\\n\\nthe context of aggression really matters.\\n\\nSo there are instances where aggression is adaptive.\\n\\nFor instance, a mother protecting her children\\n\\nif she\\'s being attacked\\n\\nor if her children are being threatened.\\n\\nI think most people would agree\\n\\nthat so-called maternal aggression of that sort,\\n\\nprovided the context is right, is a great thing.\\n\\nProtecting our young is, after all,\\n\\none of the primary adaptive drives of our species,\\n\\nand thank goodness it is.\\n\\nOf course, other forms of aggression,\\n\\nlike unprovoked proactive aggression,\\n\\nsomebody simply being violent to somebody else,\\n\\neven when unprovoked.\\n\\nMost of us cringe when we see that kind of behavior.\\n\\nIt can even evoke aggression in people\\n\\nwhen they observe that kind of behavior.\\n\\nSo again, context really matters,\\n\\nbut a more general and perhaps an even more important reason\\n\\nto think about and understand aggression\\n\\nis that by understanding the biology\\n\\nand psychology of aggression,\\n\\nyou will be in a much better position\\n\\nto understand how all emotional states come to be,\\n\\nboth in yourself and in others.\\n\\nFor instance, many of you have probably heard the statement\\n\\nthat I believe arises from pop psychology,\\n\\nnot from formal academic psychology,\\n\\nthat aggression is just sadness.\\n\\nIt\\'s a form of sadness that\\'s amplified,\\n\\nand it shows up as aggression.\\n\\nBut when we look at the underlying biology\\n\\nand the peer-reviewed literature on this,\\n\\nnothing could be further from the truth.\\n\\nWe have distinct circuits in the brain\\n\\nfor aggression versus grief and mourning.\\n\\nThose are non-overlapping.\\n\\nNow, that doesn\\'t mean that you can\\'t be sad and aggressive\\n\\nor in a state of mourning and aggressive at the same time,\\n\\nbut the idea that sadness and aggression\\n\\nare one in the same thing is simply not true.\\n\\nAnd by understanding that,\\n\\nor perhaps by understanding that irritability\\n\\nand aggression are not the same thing,\\n\\nyou\\'ll be in a much better position\\n\\nto apply some of the tools\\n\\nthat we will talk about in this episode\\n\\nin order to be able to reduce or eliminate,\\n\\nor if it\\'s adaptive to you, to modulate aggression.\\n\\nAnd yes, there are cases where modulating your aggression,\\n\\nin some cases, even amplifying aggression, can be adaptive.\\n\\nNow, this, of course, is not the first discussion\\n\\nabout the biology of aggression\\n\\nor the psychology of aggression.\\n\\nAnd we really can look to the beginning\\n\\nof the last century as the time\\n\\nin which the formal study of aggression really began.\\n\\nOne of the names that\\'s most associated\\n\\nwith the formal study of aggression\\n\\nis none other than Conrad Lorenz.\\n\\nSome of you may be familiar with that name.\\n\\nOthers of you may not be familiar with that name.\\n\\nConrad Lorenz studied so-called imprinting behaviors\\n\\nand fixed action pattern behaviors.\\n\\nHe\\'s most famous, at least in scientific circles,\\n\\nfor getting geese to believe that he was their parent.\\n\\nAnd if you were to put into Google Conrad with a K, Lorenz,\\n\\njust as it sounds, Conrad Lorenz, geese,\\n\\nyou\\'re going to see a lot of photos of Conrad walking down\\n\\nroads with a lot of geese following him,\\n\\nor swimming in lakes with a lot of geese following him.\\n\\nHe had a habit of geese adopting him\\n\\nbecause of the behaviors that he partook in.\\n\\nSo he would swim out on a lake\\n\\nin front of a bunch of little geese,\\n\\nand then they would think that he was the parent,\\n\\nand they would imprint on him.\\n\\nHe even lived with these animals, and they lived with him.\\n\\nThat\\'s a strange character from what I hear.\\n\\nBut nonetheless, all this work was deserving\\n\\nof a Nobel Prize because what he discovered\\n\\nwere fixed action patterns.\\n\\nThat is, patterns of behavior that could be evoked\\n\\nby a single stimulus.\\n\\nThis is really important.\\n\\nThe idea that you can get a whole category of behaviors,\\n\\nlike swimming behind a parent,\\n\\nor looking to somebody for comfort and only them.\\n\\nThe idea that you could get a huge category\\n\\nof different behaviors in a bunch of different contexts\\n\\ntriggered by just the presence of that person\\n\\nis remarkable because what it suggested,\\n\\nand what turns out to be true,\\n\\nis that there are neural circuits,\\n\\nnot just individual brain areas,\\n\\nbut collections of brain areas that work together\\n\\nto engage a pattern of behaviors.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s the first fundamental principle\\n\\nthat we need to define today.\\n\\nThat when we talk about aggression,\\n\\nwe\\'re talking about activation of neural circuits,\\n\\nnot individual brain areas,\\n\\nbut neural circuits that get played out in sequence,\\n\\nlike keys on a piano.\\n\\nBut that playing out in sequence\\n\\nmeans that aggression is a verb.\\n\\nIt has a beginning, a middle, and an end.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s a process, it\\'s not an event.\\n\\nAnd as you\\'ll see, that turns out to be very important\\n\\nin terms of thinking about how one can halt aggression,\\n\\nprevent it from happening before it\\'s initiated,\\n\\nor maybe even prolonging aggression,\\n\\nif that\\'s what\\'s needed.\\n\\nNow, Conrad Lorenz had no real knowledge of neural circuits.\\n\\nI mean, obviously he knew there was this thing\\n\\nthat we call a brain and a nervous system.\\n\\nAnd he knew that there were chemicals in the brain\\n\\nand hormones and things of that sort\\n\\nthat were likely to play a role.\\n\\nBut he really didn\\'t take any measures\\n\\nto define what the neural circuits were.\\n\\nFrankly, he didn\\'t need to.\\n\\nHe had his Nobel Prize and he did all this beautiful work.\\n\\nHe\\'s known for an abundance of work.\\n\\nBut he did think about what sorts of underlying processes\\n\\ncould drive something like aggression.\\n\\nAnd he talked about one particular feature\\n\\nthat\\'s especially important.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s this notion of a pressure.\\n\\nThe idea that, yes, certain hormones will bias somebody\\n\\nor an animal to be aggressive.\\n\\nCertain neurotransmitter states,\\n\\nand you\\'ll learn what those are today,\\n\\nwill bias somebody to be more or less aggressive,\\n\\nmaybe even submissive and passive,\\n\\nmaybe outright proactively aggressive\\n\\ntowards anyone or anything in front of them.\\n\\nAnd yes, of course, there will be historical features\\n\\nbased on their childhood, et cetera, et cetera.\\n\\nHe understood that there will be a constellation of things\\n\\nthat would drive people to be aggressive.\\n\\nAnd he described a so-called pressure,\\n\\nalmost like a hydraulic pressure.\\n\\nJust think about fluid pressure in a small container\\n\\nbeing pushed, pushed, pushed until the can\\n\\nor the container is ready to explode.\\n\\nAnd how multiple features, multiple variables\\n\\ncould impinge on that and create that pressure.\\n\\nIt turns out that\\'s exactly the way the system works.\\n\\nThere is no single brain area\\n\\nthat flips the switch for aggression.\\n\\nAlthough we\\'ll soon talk about a brain structure\\n\\nthat generally houses the propensity\\n\\nand the output of aggression.\\n\\nThis notion of a hydraulic pressure\\n\\nthat can drive us toward aggressive behavior,\\n\\nor conversely can be very low pressure\\n\\nand keep us in a state of non-reactivity,\\n\\nmaybe even passivity or submissiveness,\\n\\nis a very important feature\\n\\nbecause it really captures the essence\\n\\nof how neural circuits work\\n\\nwhen we\\'re talking about primitive behaviors generally.\\n\\nAnd you can start to notice this in yourself and in others.\\n\\nYou can start to notice\\n\\nwhen you are veering toward aggression,\\n\\nor when someone is veering toward aggression,\\n\\nverbal or physical.\\n\\nNow that veering is the buildup of this hydraulic pressure\\n\\nthat Lorenz was referring to.\\n\\nAnd it really does have an underlying biological basis.\\n\\nNow it was some years later\\n\\nthat the first experiments came along,\\n\\nwhich really started to identify the brain areas\\n\\nand the biological so-called pressures\\n\\nthat can induce aggressive behavior.\\n\\nAnd the person that really gets credit for this\\n\\nis a guy by the name of Walter Hess,\\n\\nwho at that time was working on cats.\\n\\nAnd I know that when you say working on cats,\\n\\na lot of people will cringe.\\n\\nA lot of people have cats as pets,\\n\\nand certainly cats can be delightful.\\n\\nSome people like them more, some people like them less.\\n\\nMost people cringe at the idea\\n\\nof doing experiments on cats.\\n\\nI should say that these days,\\n\\nvery few laboratories work on cats.\\n\\nMost laboratories that work on animal models\\n\\nwill work on flies, Drosophila fruit flies\\n\\nfor their capacity to do genetics on laboratory mice,\\n\\nsometimes rats, but usually mice.\\n\\nAnd occasionally you\\'ll find a lab that still works on cats.\\n\\nBack in the time of Hess,\\n\\nvery few laboratories worked on mice.\\n\\nMost laboratories worked on cats or rats.\\n\\nAnd the reason for that is nowadays,\\n\\nmost laboratories use mice if they use animal models\\n\\nbecause of the genetic tools that exist in mice\\n\\nto knock out this gene or knock in this gene, et cetera,\\n\\nwhich can\\'t be done in humans or non-human primates,\\n\\nat least not very easily at this point in history.\\n\\nSo when I say he was working on cats,\\n\\nI realize that probably evokes some negative emotions\\n\\nin some of you, maybe even aggression in some of you.\\n\\nWhat we can do, however, is look at the data\\n\\nand make use of the data in terms of our understanding.\\n\\nWhat Hess did was he had cats that were awake\\n\\nand he was able to lower stimulating electrode\\n\\ninto their brain.\\n\\nNow, keep in mind that the brain\\n\\ndoes not have any pain sensors.\\n\\nSo after a small hole is made in the skull,\\n\\nelectrodes are lowered into the brain.\\n\\nThis is what\\'s done commonly in human neurosurgery.\\n\\nAnd he was able to stimulate different brain areas.\\n\\nAnd he was sort of poking around.\\n\\nAnd when I say sort of,\\n\\nhe was doing this with some logical intent and purpose.\\n\\nHe wasn\\'t just poking around in there for fun.\\n\\nHe was trying to identify brain regions\\n\\nthat could generate entire categories of behavior,\\n\\na la Lorenz, right?\\n\\nThese fixed action pattern behaviors.\\n\\nEventually his electrode landed in a site\\n\\nand he provided electrical stimulation to the cat\\n\\nthat caused this otherwise passive purring, relaxing cat\\n\\nto suddenly go into an absolute rage.\\n\\nSo arched back, hissing, hair up,\\n\\nso-called pilar erection, where the hairs go up.\\n\\nAnimals try and make themselves as big as possible,\\n\\noften when they\\'re aggressive.\\n\\nDrooling, maybe even spitting, believe it or not,\\n\\ncats and other animals can do this.\\n\\nAnd the cat tried to attack him or anyone else\\n\\nand anything else, even inanimate objects,\\n\\nwhen he stimulated this particular brain area.\\n\\nSo Hess obviously took notice\\n\\nof this incredible transformation in behavior.\\n\\nAnd the fact that when he turned off the stimulation\\n\\nof this particular brain area,\\n\\nthe cat very quickly, within seconds,\\n\\nwent back to being passive, calm kitty.\\n\\nNow, of course, he repeated this experiment\\n\\nin other animals because he had to confirm\\n\\nthat it wasn\\'t just happenstance,\\n\\nthat there wasn\\'t something unique about this one cat\\n\\nthat perhaps he had stimulated an area\\n\\nthat had been built up during the kittenhood\\n\\nof this cat and had been reactivated.\\n\\nMaybe this kitten had been traumatized early in life\\n\\nor scared and reactivation of a particular circuit,\\n\\nunique to that cat, created this aggressive behavior.\\n\\nThat wasn\\'t the case.\\n\\nEvery cat that he looked at\\n\\nand stimulated this particular brain area,\\n\\nthe cat would immediately go into an aggressive,\\n\\nalmost rage-type behavior.\\n\\nNow, of course, we can\\'t anthropomorphize.\\n\\nWe don\\'t know what the cat was feeling.\\n\\nFor all we know, the cat could be happy,\\n\\nalthough that seems pretty unlikely.\\n\\nAnd later experiments done in mice, but also in humans,\\n\\nconfirm that indeed, stimulation of this brain area\\n\\nevoked not just behavioral aggression,\\n\\nbut also subjective feelings of aggression and anger.\\n\\nSo what was this incredible brain area?\\n\\nOr rather, I should say, what is the brain area\\n\\nthat harbored this incredible capacity\\n\\nto generate aggressive behavior in Hess\\'s experiments?\\n\\nWell, for those of you that are regular listeners\\n\\nof this podcast, you\\'ll probably be relieved to know\\n\\nthat today we\\'re going to talk about some new neural circuits.\\n\\nOftentimes we\\'ll center back on the amygdala\\n\\nor the prefrontal cortex, and those names will come up.\\n\\nAnd for those of you that haven\\'t heard them before,\\n\\ndon\\'t worry, I\\'ll make it clear\\n\\nas to what those brain areas are and what they do.\\n\\nBut today we\\'re going to talk a lot about\\n\\nthe so-called VMH or ventromedial hypothalamus.\\n\\nThe ventromedial hypothalamus is a nucleus,\\n\\nmeaning a small collection of neurons.\\n\\nWhat are neurons?\\n\\nNerve cells.\\n\\nAnd that small collection of neurons\\n\\nthat we call the ventromedial hypothalamus is truly small.\\n\\nIt\\'s only about 1,500 neurons on one side of your brain\\n\\nand a matching 1,500 neurons on the other side\\n\\nof your brain, and that combined 3,000 neurons or so,\\n\\nit\\'s not exactly 3,000, but 3,000 neurons or so\\n\\nis sufficient to generate aggressive behavior\\n\\nof the sort that Hess observed in the cat.\\n\\nAnd believe it or not, when you see somebody\\n\\nwho\\'s in an act of rage or in an act of verbal aggression\\n\\nor in an act of defensive aggression,\\n\\nprotecting their family or loved ones or country, et cetera,\\n\\nalmost certainly those neurons are engaged in that behavior.\\n\\nThose neurons are perhaps even generating that behavior.\\n\\nAnd next I\\'ll describe some experiments\\n\\nthat were done just recently within the last 10 years or so,\\n\\nbut leading right up until this year and even last month\\n\\nthat keep confirming again and again and again,\\n\\nthat it is the activity of neurons\\n\\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus\\n\\nthat are both necessary and sufficient\\n\\nto generate the full catalog of aggressive behaviors.\\n\\nNow, before I go further to describe\\n\\nthe beautiful recent studies on the VMH,\\n\\nthe ventromedial hypothalamus\\n\\nand the important role of testosterone\\n\\nand more importantly, estrogen\\n\\nin the activation of aggressive behavior.\\n\\nThat\\'s right, that\\'s soon to be clear to you\\n\\nwhy that\\'s the case.\\n\\nI want to emphasize that the ventromedial hypothalamus\\n\\nis something that we should all care about, why?\\n\\nWell, it turns out that many categories\\n\\nof psychiatric disorders, developmental disorders\\n\\nand psychological challenges, things like schizophrenia,\\n\\nPTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression,\\n\\nborderline personality disorder\\n\\nand even certain forms of autism\\n\\ncan include elements of aggression and even violence.\\n\\nNow, it\\'s certainly not the case that aggression\\n\\nand violence are present in all people\\n\\nwho suffer from schizophrenia or PTSD or depression\\n\\nor autism or borderline personality disorder.\\n\\nI\\'m absolutely not saying that.\\n\\nHowever, it can be a feature of those\\n\\nand it\\'s a well-described feature\\n\\nin terms of trying to understand the constellation\\n\\nof challenges that people suffer from when they have those.\\n\\nSo thinking about the VMH goes way beyond\\n\\njust understanding basic aggression\\n\\nin the context of adaptive aggression.\\n\\nSo when earlier I use the example maternal aggression,\\n\\nthat\\'s one adaptive form of aggression.\\n\\nIt also can be pathologic aggression,\\n\\nmeaning it can harm ourselves or others.\\n\\nSo keep this in mind as we go forward\\n\\nbecause later we\\'re going to talk about specific tools\\n\\ndesigned to modulate or prevent aggression in,\\n\\nfor instance, people with attention deficit\\n\\nhyperactivity disorder and especially kids with ADHD.\\n\\nIn the meantime, let\\'s return to the VMH,\\n\\nthis relatively small collection of neurons.\\n\\nAnd the reason I say relatively small is,\\n\\nwell, your brain has many hundreds of billions of neurons,\\n\\nmaybe even trillions of neurons.\\n\\nThe exact number of neurons isn\\'t really clear,\\n\\nbut it\\'s a lot.\\n\\nAnd it certainly is a lot relative to the number of neurons\\n\\nof this 3000 or so neurons living in your hypothalamus\\n\\nthat can evoke this aggressive response.\\n\\nExperiments done by David Anderson\\'s lab at Caltech\\n\\nwere really the first to parse the fine circuitry\\n\\nand to really show that the ventromedial hypothalamus\\n\\nis both necessary and sufficient for aggressive behavior.\\n\\nThese are important experiments\\n\\nand they\\'re worth knowing about.\\n\\nWhat they did was they identified, first of all,\\n\\nwhere the ventromedial hypothalamus was in the mouse.\\n\\nThat was pretty straightforward to do,\\n\\nit was sort of known before they started these experiments.\\n\\nAnd then they analyzed which genes, meaning which DNA,\\n\\nwhich of course becomes RNA and RNA becomes protein,\\n\\nwhich DNA and therefore which proteins are expressed\\n\\nin particular cells of the ventromedial hypothalamus.\\n\\nAnd it turns out that there\\'s a particular category\\n\\nof neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus\\n\\nthat make an estrogen receptor.\\n\\nAnd it is those neurons in particular\\n\\nthat are responsible for generating aggressive behavior.\\n\\nHow did they know this?\\n\\nWell, they used a tool that\\'s actually been described\\n\\nby a previous guest of this podcast.\\n\\nWe had an episode with the psychiatrist and bioengineer\\n\\nand my colleague at Stanford School of Medicine,\\n\\nCarl Diceroth.\\n\\nHe and others have developed tools\\n\\nthat allow people to control the activity of neurons,\\n\\nessentially by remote control,\\n\\nby shining light on those neurons.\\n\\nSo in the context of an experiment on a mouse,\\n\\nwhich is what David\\'s lab did,\\n\\nand these were the beautiful experiments of Dayu Lin,\\n\\nwho\\'s now in her own laboratory at New York University,\\n\\nput a little fiber optic cable\\n\\ndown into the brain of the,\\n\\ninto the hypothalamus that is of the mouse.\\n\\nThe mouse is able to move around in its cage,\\n\\nfreely moving, even though it has a little tether,\\n\\nthis little wire, it\\'s a very thin wire.\\n\\nAnd that little thin wire\\n\\nis actually a little what we call optrode.\\n\\nAnd the experimentalist, in this case, Dayu,\\n\\nwas able to stimulate the turning on\\n\\nof a little bit of blue light.\\n\\nAnd that blue light activated\\n\\nonly those estrogen receptor neurons\\n\\nin only the ventromedial hypothalamus.\\n\\nAnd the way she was able to do that\\n\\nis she had introduced a gene\\n\\nthat had been developed by our friend, Carl Diceroth,\\n\\nthat allows light to trigger electrical activity\\n\\nin those neurons.\\n\\nSo if any of that is confusing,\\n\\nor if all of that is confusing, here\\'s the experiment.\\n\\nThere\\'s a mouse in a cage,\\n\\nhas a little wire coming out of its head.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t notice, believe it or not,\\n\\nwe know this because it\\'s still eating and mating\\n\\nand doing all the things that mice like to do\\n\\non a daily basis and sleeping, et cetera.\\n\\nAnd the mere pressing of a button\\n\\nwill activate a little bit of light\\n\\nreleased at the end of that wire.\\n\\nThat light activates particular neurons.\\n\\nIn this case, it\\'s the estrogen receptor containing neurons\\n\\nin only the ventromedial hypothalamus.\\n\\nWhen that mouse is in a cage with another mouse,\\n\\na couple of things happen,\\n\\ndepending on what the other mouse is,\\n\\nor we could say who the other mouse is.\\n\\nIf it\\'s a male mouse and you put in there\\n\\nwith a female mouse,\\n\\nthe male mouse will attempt to mate with a female mouse.\\n\\nProvided that the male mouse has gone through puberty,\\n\\nhe will try to mount and mate with a female mouse.\\n\\nNow, female mice are either in a receptive phase\\n\\nor a non-receptive phase of their so-called estrous cycle.\\n\\nThey don\\'t have a menstrual 28-day cycle,\\n\\nthey have an estrous cycle.\\n\\nAnd on particular days of that estrous cycle,\\n\\nthey are not happy to mate.\\n\\nThey will basically keep their hindquarters\\n\\naway from the male mouse at all costs.\\n\\nThey\\'ll even attack the male mouse.\\n\\nOn certain days of the estrous cycle, however,\\n\\nthe female mouse will undergo what\\'s called lordosis,\\n\\nwhich is an arching of her back,\\n\\nand she\\'ll allow the male to mount and mate with her.\\n\\nSo a large number of experiments were done,\\n\\nbut the first experiment really was to put the male mouse\\n\\nin with a female mouse\\n\\nwho\\'s in the so-called receptive phase of estrous.\\n\\nThat is, she will allow mating.\\n\\nAnd he starts mating with her.\\n\\nAnd they go through the standard repertoire\\n\\nof mating behaviors that you observe in mice,\\n\\nmounting, thrusting, intromission as it\\'s called\\n\\nin the mouse sex world.\\n\\nWell, I guess I don\\'t know what the mice call it,\\n\\nbut that\\'s what the experimenters call it.\\n\\nAnd then afterwards that he will dismount, okay?\\n\\nSo they observe this kind of mounting and sex behavior.\\n\\nThis is very typical,\\n\\nbut about halfway through the behavior,\\n\\nDayou turned on the light\\n\\nto stimulate these estrogen receptor containing neurons\\n\\nonly in the male mouse.\\n\\nAnd what she observed was incredibly dramatic.\\n\\nThe male mouse ceases from trying to mate\\n\\nwith the female mouse\\n\\nand immediately tries to kill the female mouse.\\n\\nHe starts attacking her.\\n\\nThen she turns off the light, the male stops\\n\\nand goes back to trying to mate with the female mouse.\\n\\nI\\'m sure all of this was very confusing\\n\\nand disturbing to the female mouse.\\n\\nNonetheless, that was the repertoire.\\n\\nThey would mate,\\n\\nshe would stimulate these ventromedial hypothalamus neurons.\\n\\nThe male mouse would immediately try\\n\\nand attack and kill the female mouse.\\n\\nAnd then she would stop the stimulation\\n\\nand he would stop trying to attack and kill the female mouse\\n\\nreturn to the attempt at least to mate with the female mouse.\\n\\nThese are such dramatic shifts in behavior triggered\\n\\nonly by the activation of only this small set of neurons\\n\\nwithin the ventromedial hypothalamus.\\n\\nAnd for those of you that think that you can watch\\n\\nthis sort of thing without being disturbed,\\n\\nI encourage you to go to YouTube.\\n\\nWe will provide a link where you can see a video\\n\\nof this type of behavior.\\n\\nIt\\'s incredibly dramatic.\\n\\nThe shift in behavior is almost instantaneous,\\n\\noccurs within seconds, if not milliseconds,\\n\\nthousands of a second.\\n\\nThe next experiment that she did was to put a male mouse\\n\\nwith this stimulation with light capability\\n\\nin its ventromedial hypothalamus into a cage alone,\\n\\nbut with a rubber glove filled with air or water.\\n\\nMouse is walking around, sniffing, peeing,\\n\\nwhich is what male mice seem to do.\\n\\nThey seem to urinate everywhere.\\n\\nEspecially an interesting, perhaps interesting feature\\n\\nof male mice and actually many male animals,\\n\\nperhaps even humans, we don\\'t know, or maybe we do know.\\n\\nBasically, this has been observed time and time again\\n\\nin experiments, mainly by Lisa Stowers\\' lab\\n\\nat the Scripps Institute has characterized this.\\n\\nIf you put female mice into an arena or a cage,\\n\\nthey always urinate in a very small corner of that cage.\\n\\nWhereas if you put male mice into an arena or a cage,\\n\\nthey urinate everywhere.\\n\\nThey have this kind of obsession\\n\\nwith spraying their urine everywhere.\\n\\nYou can sort of transpose that to human behavior if you like.\\n\\nIn any event, Dayu put the mouse in the cage alone,\\n\\nbut with this rubber glove,\\n\\nthe mouse is walking around, urinating, et cetera,\\n\\ndoing whatever it is that mice do.\\n\\nThen she stimulates the activation\\n\\nof these ventromedial hypothalamus neurons,\\n\\nand the mouse immediately tries to kill the glove.\\n\\nIt goes into a rage, attacking the glove,\\n\\nas if it were another mouse or some other animate object.\\n\\nBut of course, it\\'s an inanimate object.\\n\\nIt\\'s just a rubber glove.\\n\\nShe stops the stimulation,\\n\\nand the mouse immediately goes back\\n\\nto being completely calm or at least not attacking.\\n\\nAgain, we don\\'t know what the mouse was feeling.\\n\\nSo these are very traumatic videos.\\n\\nAgain, you can see them by following the link\\n\\nthat we\\'ll provide in the caption.\\n\\nIf that sort of thing is going to disturb you\\n\\nto see, for instance, the one mouse attacking another,\\n\\nplease just don\\'t watch them.\\n\\nI\\'m not interested in traumatizing anybody\\n\\nor you traumatizing yourself, that is.\\n\\nA number of different variations\\n\\nwere done on this experiment.\\n\\nFor instance, stimulating the VMH in female mice,\\n\\nas opposed to male mice,\\n\\nputting the female mice in with other female mice\\n\\nor with other male mice,\\n\\nno matter what variation one carries out.\\n\\nSo it doesn\\'t matter if it\\'s male with female,\\n\\nmale with male, female with female, et cetera.\\n\\nStimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus\\n\\nin a male mouse or a female mouse\\n\\nevokes this very dramatic,\\n\\nalmost instantaneous aggressive behavior,\\n\\nphysically aggressive behavior.\\n\\nSubsequent experiments done by Dai-Yu Lin\\n\\nin her own laboratory and other laboratories\\n\\nhave shown that the ventromedial hypothalamus\\n\\nis connected with a bunch of other brain areas\\n\\nthat are interesting,\\n\\nand I\\'ll talk about some of those in a little bit.\\n\\nBut one of them that I want to call out now\\n\\nis the so-called PAG, the periaqueductal gray nucleus.\\n\\nThis is a large structure in the back of the brain\\n\\nthat houses things like neurons that can create opioids.\\n\\nWe all know of the opioid crisis,\\n\\nbut these are neurons that can produce endogenous,\\n\\nmeans made by the body,\\n\\nchemicals that can cause pain relief.\\n\\nYou could understand why that might occur\\n\\nin a circuit for aggression, right?\\n\\nEven if one is the aggressor,\\n\\nit\\'s likely that they may incur some physical damage\\n\\nand they\\'d want some pain relief.\\n\\nThe PAG also is connected to a number of neural circuits\\n\\nthat eventually, through several processing stations,\\n\\nexcuse me, arrive at things like the jaws.\\n\\nAnd in fact, stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus\\n\\ncan evoke biting and aggressive biting behavior.\\n\\nNow, aggressive biting behavior is particularly interesting\\n\\nbecause in humans, and especially in human children,\\n\\nbiting is something that,\\n\\nwhile young children might do as a form of aggression,\\n\\ntends to disappear pretty early in childhood.\\n\\nAnd if it doesn\\'t, it\\'s often seen as a mark of pathology.\\n\\nI have a story about this, actually.\\n\\nWhen I was a kid, I went to a summer sports camp.\\n\\nAnd I\\'ll never forget this.\\n\\nWe were playing soccer,\\n\\nand in a rare stroke of luck or accident,\\n\\nI happened to score a goal.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t a particularly good soccer player,\\n\\nespecially not at that stage of my life.\\n\\nThey later figured out that it was just better\\n\\nto make me a fullback,\\n\\nbecause I could just wait there and do what fullbacks do.\\n\\nI was better at taking the ball or the person out\\n\\nthan I was putting the ball in the goal.\\n\\nNonetheless, again, by chance, I scored a goal,\\n\\nand I was trotting back to my side of the field.\\n\\nAnd all of a sudden, I felt this sting in my back.\\n\\nA kid, not to be named, although I do remember your name,\\n\\nI\\'m not going to tell you what his name was,\\n\\na kid jumped on my back and bit me on the top of my back.\\n\\nAnd this, of course, resulted in a discussion\\n\\nand a timeout and all the usual things,\\n\\nand parents, I think, got involved, I don\\'t recall,\\n\\nand didn\\'t think much else of it.\\n\\nBut I recall that this was considered\\n\\nespecially troubling behavior,\\n\\nbecause he bit me as opposed to hit me\\n\\nor shoved me down or something of that sort.\\n\\nAnd it does seem as if the tendency to use biting\\n\\nas an aggressive behavior is associated\\n\\nwith a more primitive circuitry.\\n\\nNow here, I\\'m truly anthropomorphizing.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what this other kid happened to be thinking\\n\\nor feeling at the time.\\n\\nHow could I?\\n\\nAnd I certainly am not going to say that biting\\n\\nin every case reflects a pathology,\\n\\nalthough I think there is general agreement\\n\\nin the psychology community and the psychiatric community\\n\\nthat past a certain age, the using of one\\'s teeth\\n\\nto impart aggression and damage on others\\n\\nis a particularly primitive and troubling,\\n\\nor at least for the observer or the person that experiences\\n\\na pretty disturbing event.\\n\\nDayu\\'s lab has shown that activation\\n\\nof the ventromedial hypothalamus triggers\\n\\na downstream circuit in the periaqueductal gray,\\n\\nwhich then triggers a whole other set of circuits\\n\\nof fixed action patterns.\\n\\nHere we are back to Lorenz again\\n\\nwith fixed action patterns,\\n\\nincluding swinging of the limbs, punching.\\n\\nThis wouldn\\'t necessarily be controlled punching,\\n\\nbut also biting behavior.\\n\\nSo it\\'s remarkable to me at least\\n\\nthat we have circuits in our brain\\n\\nthat can evoke violent use of things like our mouth\\n\\nor violent use of things like our limbs\\n\\nthat of course could be used for things like singing\\n\\nor kissing or eating or, you know,\\n\\ngesticulating in any kind of polite or impolite way.\\n\\nThe point here is that neural circuits,\\n\\nnot individual brain areas evoke the constellation\\n\\nof behaviors that we call aggression.\\n\\nNow, many of you are probably puzzled or at least should be\\n\\nbecause I\\'ve been talking about\\n\\nthis highly specialized brain area,\\n\\nthe ventromedial hypothalamus\\n\\nand this highly specialized subcategory of neurons\\n\\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus,\\n\\nthese neurons that make estrogen receptor.\\n\\nAnd yet the activation of those cells\\n\\ntriggers dramatic and immediate aggression,\\n\\nboth in males and in females\\n\\nand both against males and against females.\\n\\nSo what\\'s going on here?\\n\\nMost of us think about estrogen\\n\\nand we don\\'t immediately think of aggression.\\n\\nMost of us hear testosterone\\n\\nand we might think about aggression,\\n\\nalthough other things as well.\\n\\nIn order to understand this,\\n\\nI just want to briefly refer back to a conversation\\n\\nthat I had on a previous episode of the Huberman Lab podcast\\n\\nand that was with my colleague, the great Robert Sapolsky,\\n\\nof course, is a professor at Stanford\\n\\nwho studied testosterone and its impacts on behavior\\n\\nas well as estrogen and other hormones\\n\\nand their impacts on behavior.\\n\\nTo make a long story short\\n\\nand to dispel a still unfortunately very common myth,\\n\\ntestosterone does not increase aggressiveness.\\n\\nTestosterone increases proactivity\\n\\nand the willingness to lean into effort\\n\\nin competitive scenarios.\\n\\nSometimes this is referred to as the challenge hypothesis,\\n\\nbut to make a long story short,\\n\\nif people are given testosterone\\n\\nor if you look at people who have different levels,\\n\\nexcuse me, of testosterone endogenously\\n\\nthat they naturally make,\\n\\nwhat you\\'ll find is that testosterone\\n\\ntends to increase competitiveness,\\n\\nbut not just in aggressive scenarios.\\n\\nSo if somebody is already aggressive,\\n\\ngiving them testosterone will have the tendency\\n\\nto make them more aggressive.\\n\\nIf somebody, however, is very benevolent and altruistic,\\n\\ngiving them testosterone will make them more benevolent\\n\\nand altruistic, at least up to a point.\\n\\nNow, of course, there are certain forms\\n\\nof synthetic testosterone that are known\\n\\nin sports circles and in other circles\\n\\nto increase aggressiveness because of the way\\n\\nthose particular forms of synthetic testosterone work.\\n\\nBut in general, most of the experiments\\n\\nthat I\\'m referring to have not been done using those.\\n\\nThey\\'ve been done using the,\\n\\nlet\\'s call them the more traditional\\n\\nbiological forms of testosterone\\n\\nor that resemble the biological forms of testosterone.\\n\\nIn fact, Robert Sapolsky described\\n\\na really interesting experiment\\n\\nin which if you look at testosterone levels\\n\\nor you administer additional testosterone\\n\\nto people who are doing philanthropy,\\n\\ngiving money to organizations,\\n\\nand so they\\'re essentially doing good\\n\\nbecause these are organizations doing good,\\n\\nwhat you find is that increased testosterone\\n\\nor further increasing testosterone\\n\\nmakes people more willing to compete\\n\\nto give more money than the other person in the room\\n\\nin order to put it in air quotes\\n\\nto alpha out the other person by giving more money.\\n\\nSo this is an act of altruistic or benevolent philanthropy.\\n\\nIt is not an act of aggression.\\n\\nOf course, we don\\'t know what the people\\n\\nare feeling underneath all that.\\n\\nAgain, we can\\'t anthropomorphize\\n\\nor project onto other people what they\\'re feeling.\\n\\nBut the point is that testosterone itself\\n\\ndoes not make people more aggressive.\\n\\nAnd in the experiments that we\\'ve been talking about\\n\\nup until now, it\\'s actually the activation\\n\\nof estrogen receptor containing neurons\\n\\nthat makes these animals more aggressive.\\n\\nAnd it turns out there\\'s evidence\\n\\nthat in certain contexts,\\n\\nestrogen can make people more aggressive.\\n\\nSo what\\'s going on here?\\n\\nWell, what\\'s going on is that testosterone\\n\\ncan be converted into estrogen\\n\\nthrough a process called aromatization.\\n\\nThere\\'s an enzyme called aromatase.\\n\\nAnytime you have word that ends in A-S-E,\\n\\nat least if it\\'s in the context of biology,\\n\\nit\\'s almost always, not always,\\n\\nbut almost always an enzyme.\\n\\nSo the aromatase enzyme converts testosterone into estrogen.\\n\\nAnd it is actually testosterone aromatized,\\n\\nconverted into estrogen and then binding\\n\\nto these estrogen-containing neurons\\n\\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus that triggers aggression.\\n\\nI want to repeat that.\\n\\nIt is not testosterone itself that triggers aggression.\\n\\nIt is testosterone aromatized into estrogen\\n\\nwithin the brain and binding to these estrogen receptor\\n\\ncontaining neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus\\n\\nthat evokes aggression and dramatic aggression at that.\\n\\nNow, this effect of estrogen causing aggression\\n\\nin the brain is very robust.\\n\\nSo much so that if you take a mouse\\n\\nthat lacks the aromatase enzyme\\n\\nor a human that lacks the aromatase enzyme,\\n\\nand they do exist,\\n\\nthen there is a reduction in overall aggression\\n\\ndespite high levels of testosterone.\\n\\nAnd if people who, or mice who have the aromatase enzyme\\n\\nhave that enzyme blocked,\\n\\nwell then it doesn\\'t matter how much you increase testosterone\\n\\nor any of its other derivatives,\\n\\nyou do not observe this aggression.\\n\\nSo this runs counter to everything that we know\\n\\nand think about the role of testosterone.\\n\\nAgain, testosterone increases competitiveness.\\n\\nIt can increase the desire to work under challenge.\\n\\nI\\'ve said it before and I ran this or pressure tested this\\n\\nagainst Robert Sapolsky who\\'s been working on testosterone\\n\\nand its role in the brain and behavior for many decades now.\\n\\nIt is fair to say that testosterone has the net effect\\n\\nof making effort feel good,\\n\\nor at least increasing the threshold\\n\\nat which effort feels bad or unsustainable.\\n\\nAnd it does that by way of changing the activity\\n\\nor the threshold for activation of brain structures\\n\\nlike the amygdala and other brain structures\\n\\nassociated with anxiety.\\n\\nSo the next time somebody says\\n\\ntestosterone makes people aggressive,\\n\\nyou can say, ah, no, actually it\\'s estrogen\\n\\nthat makes people aggressive\\n\\nand animals aggressive for that matter.\\n\\nNow, of course it is the case that because males\\n\\nhave relatively less estrogen circulating\\n\\nin their brain and body than females, right?\\n\\nBecause they have testes, not ovaries,\\n\\nthat testosterone is required in the first place\\n\\nin order to be converted into estrogen\\n\\nto activate this aggressive circuit involving\\n\\nthese estrogen receptor containing neurons\\n\\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus.\\n\\nBut nonetheless, it is estrogen that is the final step.\\n\\nIt is the hormone on which aggression hinges.\\n\\nAnd I think for most people,\\n\\nthat\\'s a quite surprising finding.\\n\\nAnd yet this is perhaps one of the more robust findings\\n\\nin both the animal and human literature\\n\\nas it relates to hormones\\n\\nand psychological states and behavior.\\n\\nNow, of course it is the case that if testosterone is low,\\n\\nthat a person or an animal\\n\\nwill exhibit less aggressive behavior.\\n\\nBut that\\'s not because of reduced testosterone per se,\\n\\nit\\'s because of the subsequent reduction in testosterone.\\n\\nMeaning if there\\'s no testosterone to aromatize into estrogen,\\n\\nestrogen will also be lower.\\n\\nSo we\\'ve established that it\\'s not testosterone\\n\\nbut testosterone converted into estrogen\\n\\nthat activates these circuits for aggression.\\n\\nBut nonetheless, it\\'s still surprising, right?\\n\\nI mean, most of us don\\'t think about estrogen\\n\\nas the hormone that stimulates aggression,\\n\\nbut it turns out it\\'s all contextual.\\n\\nThere are beautiful data showing that\\n\\nwhether or not estrogen stimulates aggression\\n\\ncan be powerfully modulated by whether or not\\n\\ndays are short or days are long.\\n\\nIn other words, whether or not\\n\\nthere\\'s a lot of sunshine or not.\\n\\nNow, obviously brain is encased in skull.\\n\\nSo it doesn\\'t really know\\n\\nif there\\'s a lot of sunshine out there,\\n\\neven though you can see the sun with your eyes,\\n\\nyou can feel it on your skin.\\n\\nDay length is converted into hormonal signals\\n\\nand chemical signals.\\n\\nAnd the primary hormonal and chemical signals\\n\\ninvolve melatonin and dopamine and also the stress hormones.\\n\\nSo to make a very long story short,\\n\\nin the long days where we get a lot of sunlight,\\n\\nboth in our eyes and on our skin,\\n\\nmelatonin levels are reduced.\\n\\nMelatonin is a hormone that tends to produce\\n\\nstates of sleepiness and quiescence.\\n\\nIt also tends to activate pathways\\n\\nthat tend to reduce things like breeding\\n\\nand sexual behavior.\\n\\nIn long days, dopamine is increased.\\n\\nDopamine is a molecule associated\\n\\nwith feelings of wellbeing and motivation\\n\\nand the desire to seek out all sorts of things,\\n\\nall sorts of motivated behaviors.\\n\\nAnd in long days, provided we\\'re getting enough sunlight\\n\\non our skin and to our eyes,\\n\\nthe stress hormones, especially cortisol\\n\\nand some of the other stress hormones,\\n\\nare reduced in levels.\\n\\nIf estrogen levels are increased experimentally\\n\\nunder long day conditions, it does not evoke aggression.\\n\\nHowever, in short days, if estrogen is increased,\\n\\nthere\\'s a heightened predisposition for aggression.\\n\\nAnd that makes perfect sense\\n\\nif you think about what short days do\\n\\nto the biology of your brain and body.\\n\\nIn short days, the melatonin signal goes up.\\n\\nThere\\'s more melatonin circulating\\n\\nfor more of each 24-hour cycle.\\n\\nStress hormones are circulating more.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nShort days tend to be associated with winter.\\n\\nIn winter, we are bombarded with more bacteria and viruses\\n\\nbecause bacteria and viruses actually survive better\\n\\nin cold than they do in heat.\\n\\nIn fact, in my laboratory,\\n\\nwe work with a lot of viruses and bacteria,\\n\\nand when we want to keep them alive,\\n\\nwe put them in the freezer.\\n\\nIf we want to kill them, if we want to inoculate them,\\n\\nwe put them under UV light,\\n\\nlike you would see from the sunlight.\\n\\nSo shorter days are conducive to aggression,\\n\\nnot because days are short per se,\\n\\nbut because stress hormone levels are higher\\n\\nand because dopamine levels are lower.\\n\\nNow, here\\'s where all of this starts to converge\\n\\non a very clear biological picture,\\n\\na very clear psychological picture,\\n\\nand indeed a very clear set of tools\\n\\nthat we can think about and use.\\n\\nUnder conditions where cortisol is high,\\n\\nwhere the stress hormone is elevated,\\n\\nand under conditions\\n\\nwhere the neuromodulator serotonin is reduced,\\n\\nthere is a greater propensity for estrogen\\n\\nto trigger aggression.\\n\\nNow, again, I know I\\'ve said it before,\\n\\nbut for males who make a lot of testosterone\\n\\nrelative to estrogen,\\n\\nyou have to swap in your mind this idea\\n\\nthat if testosterone is high,\\n\\nthat means that estrogen is low,\\n\\nbecause while that can be true in the periphery in the body,\\n\\nif testosterone is high,\\n\\nthere is going to be some aromatization,\\n\\nthat conversion of testosterone to estrogen.\\n\\nSo anytime you hear that testosterone is high,\\n\\nyou should think testosterone is high in the body\\n\\nand perhaps estrogen is low in the body,\\n\\nbut that means that there\\'s going to be\\n\\nheightened levels of estrogen in the brain\\n\\nand therefore increased propensity for aggression.\\n\\nIn females who generally make less testosterone\\n\\nrelative to estrogen,\\n\\nthere is sufficient estrogen already present\\n\\nto trigger aggression.\\n\\nSo both males and females are primed for aggression,\\n\\nbut that\\'s riding on a context,\\n\\nand that context of whether or not you get\\n\\na tendency for aggression or not\\n\\ndepends on whether or not cortisol is high or low,\\n\\nand I\\'m telling you that if cortisol is relatively higher\\n\\nin any individual, there\\'s going to be a tilt,\\n\\nan increase in that hydraulic pressure\\n\\nthat Lorenz talked about toward aggression.\\n\\nAnd if serotonin, the neuromodulator,\\n\\nthat is associated with feelings of wellbeing\\n\\nand sometimes even of slight passivity,\\n\\nbut certainly of wellbeing, if serotonin is low,\\n\\nthere\\'s also going to be a further shift\\n\\ntowards an aggressive tendency.\\n\\nSo if we return to Lorenz\\'s hydraulic pressure model\\n\\nof aggression in other internal states,\\n\\nwe realize that external stimuli,\\n\\nthings that we hear, things that we see,\\n\\nfor instance, someone saying something upsetting\\n\\nor us seeing somebody do something\\n\\nthat we don\\'t like to others or to us,\\n\\nas well as our internal state,\\n\\nour subjective feelings of wellbeing,\\n\\nbut also our stress level,\\n\\nour feelings of whether or not we have enough resources\\n\\nand are content with what we have,\\n\\nall of that is converging on this thing\\n\\nthat we call internal state and creating this pressure\\n\\nof either to be more aggressive or less aggressive.\\n\\nAnd now we have some major players\\n\\nfeeding into that final pathway,\\n\\nthat question of whether or not,\\n\\nwill we hit the other person?\\n\\nWill we say the thing that is considered aggressive?\\n\\nWill we not say it?\\n\\nIf somebody says something\\n\\nor does something aggressive to us,\\n\\nwill we respond or will we be submissive or even passive?\\n\\nAgain, there are many things funneling into that question\\n\\nand dictating whether or not the answer\\n\\nis absolutely I\\'ll fight back\\n\\nor I\\'m going to attack them even unprovoked\\n\\nor if they say this, I\\'m going to do that\\n\\nor no matter what they do, I\\'m not going to respond.\\n\\nThese kinds of things are very complex\\n\\nand yet we really can boil them down\\n\\nto just a few common elements.\\n\\nAnd I\\'m telling you that those elements\\n\\nare whether or not cortisol levels are relatively lower\\n\\nor relatively higher.\\n\\nAgain, relatively higher is going to tend\\n\\nto make people more reactive, why?\\n\\nBecause reactivity is really a function\\n\\nof the autonomic nervous system,\\n\\nwhich is sort of like a seesaw\\n\\nthat oscillates between the so-called sympathetic arm\\n\\nof the autonomic nervous system,\\n\\nwhich tends to put us into a state of readiness\\n\\nthrough the release of adrenaline.\\n\\nCortisol and adrenaline\\n\\nwhen they\\'re circulating in the brain and body\\n\\nmake us more likely to move and to react and to speak.\\n\\nIt\\'s actually what will induce a kind of low level tremor,\\n\\nwhich is an anticipatory tremor\\n\\nto be able to move more quickly, right?\\n\\nA body in motion is more easily set into further motion,\\n\\nthat is.\\n\\nAnd the neuromodulator serotonin is a neuromodulator\\n\\nthat in general is associated with feelings of wellbeing\\n\\nin response to what we already have.\\n\\nSo when we are well-fed,\\n\\nserotonin tends to be released in our brain and body,\\n\\nin particular, well-fed with carbohydrates.\\n\\nThe precursor to serotonin is tryptophan.\\n\\nAnd indeed there are nice studies\\n\\nexploring the types of diets, nutritional programs\\n\\nthat can reduce aggressive behavior,\\n\\nboth in children and in adults.\\n\\nAnd tryptophan rich diets or supplementation with tryptophan.\\n\\nSo for tryptophan rich diets, things like white turkey meat,\\n\\nbut then there are also a number of carbohydrates.\\n\\nYou can look up, it\\'s very easy to find foods\\n\\nthat contain lots of tryptophan.\\n\\nThose foods contain the precursor to serotonin.\\n\\nNow it isn\\'t simply the case that eating more foods\\n\\nwith tryptophan will tend to reduce your aggression.\\n\\nI suppose it could do that if you ate it in abundance,\\n\\nit could make you tired\\n\\nand then you\\'re less likely to be aggressive.\\n\\nI don\\'t recommend that strategy.\\n\\nBut the idea here is that when it\\'s been explored,\\n\\nincreasing levels of tryptophan,\\n\\neither by supplementation or by food or drugs,\\n\\nprescription drugs that increase serotonin.\\n\\nSo for instance, fluoxetine,\\n\\nsometimes called Prozac or Zoloft\\n\\nor any number of the other SSRIs\\n\\ntend to reduce aggressive behavior.\\n\\nNow, not always, but in general, that\\'s the case.\\n\\nSimilarly, because elevated cortisol\\n\\ntends to shift the whole system,\\n\\nagain, create more of a hydraulic pressure\\n\\ntowards aggressive states.\\n\\nIf cortisol levels are reduced,\\n\\nwell then the tendency for aggressive behavior is reduced.\\n\\nThis is supported by a number of peer-reviewed studies.\\n\\nWe\\'ll provide links to some of those\\n\\nin the caption show notes.\\n\\nAnd we\\'re going to return to these a bit later\\n\\nin the context of specific studies\\n\\nthat have looked at genetic variants\\n\\nin different individuals\\n\\nthat cause them to make more or less serotonin\\n\\nor at least to metabolize serotonin differently.\\n\\nThis is also the case\\n\\nfor so-called intermittent explosive disorder\\n\\nthat can often be associated with gene variants\\n\\nthat control how much serotonin is made\\n\\nor how it\\'s metabolized or how much cortisol is made\\n\\nand how much it\\'s metabolized.\\n\\nIn thinking about tools,\\n\\nthere are a number of things that one could consider.\\n\\nFirst of all, there are a number of decent studies\\n\\nexploring how supplementation with the omega-3 fatty acids,\\n\\nwhich are precursors of some of the transmitter systems,\\n\\nincluding serotonin that can modulate,\\n\\nnot directly mediate, but modulate mood and emotional tone.\\n\\nSupplementation with the omega-3s has been shown\\n\\nto reduce impulsivity and aggressiveness in certain contexts\\n\\nin things like ADHD or in individuals\\n\\nwho have a predisposition for aggressive type behavior\\n\\nor aggressive thinking.\\n\\nNow, that doesn\\'t necessarily mean\\n\\nthat the omega-3 fatty acids\\n\\nare going directly to the ventromedial hypothalamus\\n\\nand changing the activity of neurons.\\n\\nThey\\'re more likely they are causing\\n\\nor modulating an overall shift in mood\\n\\nthrough the immune system, through hormone systems\\n\\nthat are changing the overall tone or the propensity\\n\\nfor neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus to be activated.\\n\\nHow much omega-3 fatty acid, what source?\\n\\nWell, we\\'ve talked about this on the podcast before.\\n\\nYou can, of course, get omega-3 fatty acids\\n\\nfrom a number of different foods.\\n\\nGetting them from whole foods\\n\\nis probably the best way to do it.\\n\\nBut many people, including people with depression,\\n\\nwill often supplement with one gram or more\\n\\nof omega-3 fatty acids per day.\\n\\nSome people, including myself, will take them every day\\n\\nas just a general mood enhancer.\\n\\nI don\\'t suffer from depression,\\n\\nbut I\\'ve found it to be beneficial for my health.\\n\\nAnd so some people will do that.\\n\\nAnd I\\'ve talked about before\\n\\nhow in double-blind placebo-controlled studies,\\n\\npeople taking one to three grams\\n\\nof omega-3 fatty acids per day,\\n\\ntypically in the form of a high-quality fish oil,\\n\\nalthough there are other sources as well,\\n\\nalgae and so forth, can experience improvements in mood\\n\\nthat are on par with some of the SSRIs,\\n\\nthe selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.\\n\\nAnd of course, if you\\'re prescribed an SSRI\\n\\nby your psychiatrist or other doctor,\\n\\nplease do take that and don\\'t cease to take it\\n\\njust simply to take omega-3s.\\n\\nHowever, you might mention to them,\\n\\nand you can find links to the studies\\n\\nin our previous episodes on depression,\\n\\nthat supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids\\n\\nat this one gram or more of EPA specifically,\\n\\nso getting above that one gram threshold\\n\\nas high as three grams per day of the EPA\\n\\nhas allowed people to take lower doses of SSRIs\\n\\nand still keep their mood in a place\\n\\nthat\\'s beneficial for them.\\n\\nAnd in terms of keeping cortisol in a range that\\'s healthy\\n\\nand doesn\\'t bias someone toward high levels of aggression\\n\\nand irritability,\\n\\nthat\\'s again going to be set by a number of larger modulators\\n\\nor contextual cues.\\n\\nAnd I\\'ve talked about some of those on the podcast,\\n\\nbut I\\'ll just briefly recap them now.\\n\\nObviously getting sunlight in your eyes early in the day\\n\\nand as much sunlight as you safely can in your eyes\\n\\nthroughout the day is going to be important.\\n\\nAgain, because of this effect of estrogen in long days,\\n\\nnot increasing aggression.\\n\\nHowever, in shorter days, estrogen increases aggression\\n\\nbecause of the increase in cortisol observed in short days.\\n\\nAnother way to reduce cortisol was discussed\\n\\nin our episode on heat and the use of sauna and heat,\\n\\nbut also hot baths.\\n\\nIt turns out that hot baths and sauna\\n\\ncan be very beneficial for reducing cortisol.\\n\\nAll the details on that are included\\n\\nin the episode on heat and its timestamps,\\n\\nso you can go directly to that\\n\\nif you want to learn about the temperatures\\n\\nand the various durations,\\n\\nbut to just give a synopsis of that,\\n\\na 20 minute sauna at anywhere from 80 to 100 degrees Celsius\\n\\nis going to be beneficial for reducing cortisol.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t have access to a sauna,\\n\\nyou could do a hot bath,\\n\\nadjust the temperature so you don\\'t burn yourself.\\n\\nI think 80 to 100 degrees Celsius\\n\\nis going to be too hot for many people if it\\'s a hot bath,\\n\\nwhereas many people who can\\'t tolerate that hot bath\\n\\ncan tolerate the sauna.\\n\\nSo safety first always, and of course,\\n\\nbut hot baths reduce cortisol.\\n\\nHot saunas reduce cortisol of a duration\\n\\nabout 20 to 30 minutes is going to be beneficial.\\n\\nAnd of course, some of you may be interested\\n\\nin exploring the supplementation route.\\n\\nAnd for reductions in cortisol,\\n\\nreally the chief player there is ashwagandha,\\n\\nwhich is known to decrease cortisol fairly potently.\\n\\nI should just warn you that if you\\'re going to use ashwagandha\\n\\nin order to reduce cortisol,\\n\\nfirst of all, check with your doctor or healthcare provider\\n\\nbefore adding or subtracting anything\\n\\nfrom your supplementation or health regimen.\\n\\nOf course, I don\\'t just say that to protect us.\\n\\nI say that to protect you.\\n\\nYou are responsible for your health,\\n\\nwhat you take and what you don\\'t take.\\n\\nChronic supplementation with ashwagandha\\n\\ncan have some not so great effects of disruption\\n\\nof other hormone pathways and neurotransmitter pathways.\\n\\nSo the limit seems to be about two weeks of regular use\\n\\nbefore you\\'d want to take a break of about two weeks.\\n\\nSo ashwagandha, again, a very potent inhibitor of cortisol,\\n\\nbut with some other effects as well.\\n\\nDon\\'t use it chronically for longer than two weeks.\\n\\nBut if your goal is to reduce cortisol,\\n\\nlet\\'s say you\\'re going through a period\\n\\nof increased irritability and aggressive tendency,\\n\\nmaybe you\\'re also not getting as much light\\n\\nas you would like.\\n\\nAnd perhaps also if there are other circumstantial things\\n\\nleading you towards more aggressiveness\\n\\nand your goal is to reduce aggressiveness,\\n\\nthat can be potentially helpful.\\n\\nAnd in light of all this stuff about cortisol\\n\\nand estrogen and day length,\\n\\nI should mention that there are in fact some people\\n\\nwho have a genetic predisposition\\n\\nto be more irritable and aggressive.\\n\\nAnd there are a couple of different gene pathways\\n\\nassociated with this.\\n\\nWe never like to think about just one gene\\n\\ncausing a specific behavior.\\n\\nThe way to think about genes is that genes generally code\\n\\nfor things within our biology.\\n\\nIn the context of today\\'s discussion,\\n\\nthings like neural circuits\\n\\nor the amounts of neurotransmitters that are made\\n\\nor the amounts of hormones that are made\\n\\nor the amount of neurotransmitter hormone receptors\\n\\nor enzymes, et cetera,\\n\\nthat shift the activity of our biology\\n\\nin a particular direction.\\n\\nThey bias our biology.\\n\\nAnd in fact, there is a genetic variant\\n\\npresent in certain people\\n\\nthat adjusts their estrogen receptor sensitivity.\\n\\nAnd that estrogen receptor sensitivity\\n\\ncan result in increased levels of aggression,\\n\\nsometimes dramatic increases.\\n\\nHowever, and also very interestingly,\\n\\nphoto period, meaning day length,\\n\\nis a strong modulator of whether or not\\n\\nthat aggressiveness turns up or not.\\n\\nWhether or not that person with the particular gene variant\\n\\nis more aggressive or not depends on how long the day is\\n\\nand how long the night is.\\n\\nOne particular study that I like that references this\\n\\nis Trainer et al.\\n\\nThe title of the study is photo period\\n\\nreverses the effects of estrogens on male aggression\\n\\nvia genomic and non-genomic pathways.\\n\\nThis was a paper published\\n\\nin the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\\n\\nWe\\'ll put a reference to this in the show notes,\\n\\nif you\\'d like to explore it further.\\n\\nBut it really points to the fact that rarely, sometimes,\\n\\nbut rarely is it the case that just one gene\\n\\nwill cause somebody to be hyper aggressive.\\n\\nAlmost always, there\\'s going to be an interplay\\n\\nbetween genetics and environment.\\n\\nAnd as environment changes, such as day length changes\\n\\nand the length of night changes,\\n\\nso too will the tendency for people\\n\\nwith a given genetic variant to be more aggressive or not.\\n\\nNow, of course, in the absence of detailed genetic testing\\n\\nfor this particular estrogen receptor variant,\\n\\nmost people, I\\'m guessing you,\\n\\nare probably not walking around\\n\\nknowing that you have this gene or not.\\n\\nRegardless, I think it\\'s important to pay attention\\n\\nto how you feel at different times of year,\\n\\ndepending on whether or not it\\'s summer,\\n\\nwhether or not it\\'s winter,\\n\\nwhether or not you\\'re getting sufficient sunlight,\\n\\nmeaning viewing sufficient sunlight or not,\\n\\nwhether or not you\\'re getting sufficient sunlight exposure\\n\\nto your skin or not,\\n\\nwhether or not you\\'re indoors all the time.\\n\\nGenerally, those things correlate with season,\\n\\nbut not always.\\n\\nYou can go through long bouts of hard work\\n\\nin the summer months when days are long,\\n\\nbut you\\'re indoors a lot\\n\\nand getting a lot of fluorescent light exposure\\n\\nlate in the evening,\\n\\nand perhaps that\\'s when you\\'re feeling more aggressive.\\n\\nSo we have to be careful about drawing\\n\\na one-to-one relationship between any biological feature\\n\\nand certainly psychological or behavioral feature\\n\\nlike aggressiveness.\\n\\nBut it\\'s, I believe, helpful to know\\n\\nthat these genetic biases exist, how they play out.\\n\\nAgain, they shift our biology\\n\\nin a general thematic direction.\\n\\nThey don\\'t change one thing.\\n\\nThey change a variety of things\\n\\nthat bias us toward or away\\n\\nfrom certain psychological and behavioral outcomes\\n\\nand the various things that we can do\\n\\nin order to offset them.\\n\\nWe described those earlier\\n\\nin terms of trying to keep cortisol low\\n\\nby getting sufficient sunlight,\\n\\nregardless of time of year\\n\\nand regardless of whether or not you happen\\n\\nto have this particular genetic variant.\\n\\nSo earlier I talked about how it is testosterone\\n\\nconverted into estrogen that\\'s activating aggression\\n\\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus, not testosterone itself.\\n\\nHowever, there are some studies carried out in humans\\n\\nthat have evaluated the effects of testosterone\\n\\nand how levels of testosterone\\n\\ncorrelate with aggressiveness in the short term.\\n\\nI\\'m just going to detail a few of those studies\\n\\nbecause I think they are interesting and important.\\n\\nFirst of all, there is a study\\n\\nthat has explored levels of testosterone\\n\\nin men of different professions.\\n\\nNow, before I tell you the data,\\n\\nI want to be very clear here.\\n\\nWith a study such as this,\\n\\none never knows whether or not these men\\n\\nwent into a particular profession\\n\\nbecause they had a testosterone level of a given value\\n\\nor whether or not the work itself\\n\\naltered their testosterone levels or both.\\n\\nAnd I think it\\'s fair to assume that it\\'s probably both.\\n\\nSo be very careful in assuming that\\n\\na given testosterone level is causal\\n\\nfor choosing a particular career\\n\\nor that a particular career is causal\\n\\nfor creating a particular testosterone level.\\n\\nThis study used salivary testosterone levels as the measure,\\n\\nwhich to be fair is not the best way to measure testosterone.\\n\\nTypically blood draw would be the best way\\n\\nto measure testosterone, but nonetheless,\\n\\nprovided the appropriate methods are used,\\n\\nsalivary testosterone can be a reasonable measure\\n\\nof testosterone.\\n\\nThe different occupations that were looked at were,\\n\\nand here they just looked at men in this particular study,\\n\\nwere ministers, salesmen,\\n\\nthey didn\\'t say what particular types of salesmen,\\n\\nfiremen, professors, of all things,\\n\\nphysicians and NFL players.\\n\\nAnd what they discovered was that the testosterone levels\\n\\nwere essentially in that order from low to highest.\\n\\nSo minister, salesman, fireman, professor, physician,\\n\\nNFL player.\\n\\nNow we could micro dissect all the different stereotypes\\n\\nand all the different features of each of these jobs.\\n\\nFor instance, we don\\'t know whether or not the fact\\n\\nthat the firemen happened, at least in this study,\\n\\nto have lower testosterone levels on average\\n\\nthan the professors or the physicians\\n\\nwas because firemen have lower testosterone levels\\n\\nor because they have a much more stressful job\\n\\nand their cortisol levels are higher\\n\\nthan the professor or the physician\\n\\nand cortisol and testosterone, not always,\\n\\nbut generally are in somewhat antagonistic push-pull mode\\n\\nbecause they derive from the same precursor, et cetera.\\n\\nTypically, when cortisol is high,\\n\\ntestosterone tends to be lower and vice versa.\\n\\nSo we don\\'t know what\\'s causing these effects.\\n\\nAnd again, this is just one study and just six occupations,\\n\\nbut I think it\\'s relatively interesting\\n\\ngiven the fact that each of these professions\\n\\ninvolves different levels of competitiveness, right?\\n\\nSo we don\\'t necessarily just want to think about\\n\\nthe level of physical exertion that\\'s required,\\n\\nbut also the level of competitiveness\\n\\nbecause it\\'s known that competitive interactions\\n\\ncan cause increases in testosterone,\\n\\nin particular in the winners of competitive interactions,\\n\\na topic for a future podcast.\\n\\nMeanwhile, studies that have analyzed also, again,\\n\\nsalivary testosterone in prisoners,\\n\\nin this case, female prisoners,\\n\\nso these are incarcerated individuals,\\n\\nhave looked at levels of testosterone\\n\\naccording to whether or not the person committed\\n\\na nonviolent or a violent crime in order to arrive in prison\\n\\nand higher levels of salivary testosterone\\n\\nwere related to those that had arrived in prison\\n\\nbecause of conviction of a violent crime\\n\\nas opposed to a nonviolent crime.\\n\\nLikewise, when they analyzed prison rule violations,\\n\\nso an indirect measure of aggressiveness,\\n\\nbut in this case, it was strongly associated\\n\\nwith aggressiveness because they knew\\n\\nwhat the violations were.\\n\\nThey found where for prisoners that had none,\\n\\nno prison violations, prison rule violations, I should say,\\n\\ntheir testosterone levels tended to be lower\\n\\nthan the testosterone levels of women that had some,\\n\\neven one or more aggressive violations of prison rules.\\n\\nWe\\'ll provide links to these studies in the show notes\\n\\nif you\\'d like to go into them further.\\n\\nObviously, studies like this need to be taken\\n\\nwith a grain of salt because there are\\n\\nso many different factors, different prisons\\n\\nhave different degrees of violence to begin with\\n\\nand competitiveness to begin with,\\n\\nbut just as a final pass at examining the role\\n\\nbetween testosterone and aggressiveness,\\n\\nthere was a very interesting study from Gotts et al,\\n\\nG-O-E-T-Z, published in 2014, that looked at serum,\\n\\nso in this case, blood levels of testosterone,\\n\\n30 minutes after application\\n\\nof a gel-based testosterone that goes transdermal\\n\\nso that the testosterone can go very quickly\\n\\ninto the bloodstream and then did brain imaging\\n\\nto evaluate the activity of neurons\\n\\nin the so-called corticomedial amygdala.\\n\\nThe medial amygdala is one of the areas\\n\\nof the amygdala complex, as we call it,\\n\\nbecause it\\'s complex, it\\'s got a lot of different nuclei,\\n\\nyou now know what nuclei are, low clusters of neurons,\\n\\nit\\'s got a lot of different ones,\\n\\nbut that medial and that corticomedial amygdala\\n\\nin particular is known to be associated\\n\\nwith aggressive type behaviors.\\n\\nIt\\'s linked up with, it\\'s part of the larger circuit\\n\\nthat includes the ventromedial hypothalamus\\n\\nand other brain areas that we referred to earlier,\\n\\nsuch as the P-A-G.\\n\\nWhat is remarkable about this study is that it showed\\n\\nthat just 30 minutes after application\\n\\nof this so-called androgel, this testosterone\\n\\nthat seeps into the bloodstream,\\n\\nthere was a significant increase in, of course,\\n\\ntestosterone and corticomedial amygdala activation.\\n\\nSo testosterone can have acute effects, immediate effects\\n\\non the pathways related to aggression.\\n\\nAnd I think this is something that\\'s not often discussed\\n\\nbecause many of the effects of steroid hormones\\n\\nlike testosterone and estrogen are very slow acting.\\n\\nIn fact, steroid hormones,\\n\\nbecause they have a certain biochemical composition\\n\\ncan actually pass through the membranes of cells.\\n\\nSo the outside of a cell and into the nucleus of the cell\\n\\nand change gene expression in the cell.\\n\\nYou think about puberty, the kid that goes home\\n\\nfor the summer and then comes back\\n\\nlooking completely different.\\n\\nWell, that\\'s because of a lot of genes got turned on\\n\\nby steroid hormones like testosterone and estrogen.\\n\\nBut the steroid hormones can also have\\n\\nvery fast acting effects.\\n\\nAnd with testosterone in particular,\\n\\nthose can be remarkably fast acting.\\n\\nAnd one of the most apparent\\n\\nand well-documented fast acting effects is this effect,\\n\\nthe ability to activate cells within the amygdala.\\n\\nSo you might say,\\n\\nwell, I thought the amygdala was associated with fear.\\n\\nWouldn\\'t testosterone then cause fear?\\n\\nNo, it turns out that the amygdala harbors\\n\\nboth cortisol, corticosterone receptors\\n\\nand testosterone receptors.\\n\\nAnd they each adjust the activity in the amygdala differently\\n\\nsuch that testosterone tends to activate amygdala circuitry\\n\\nfor inducing states of mind and body\\n\\nthat are more action-based.\\n\\nAnd indeed in animals and in humans,\\n\\ntestosterone application and activation\\n\\nof this cortico-medial amygdala pathway\\n\\nwill make animals and humans lean into effort.\\n\\nThis is why I say testosterone makes effort feel good\\n\\nor at least biases the organism\\n\\ntoward leaning into challenge.\\n\\nSo if you recall, there\\'s not just one type of aggression.\\n\\nThere\\'s reactive aggression,\\n\\nwhich is triggered when one is confronted\\n\\nwith something that sometimes is inevitable, right?\\n\\nOne needs to fight for their life\\n\\nor for somebody else\\'s life,\\n\\nbut also proactive aggression.\\n\\nAnd proactive aggression involves activation\\n\\nof those go pathways in the basal ganglia\\n\\nand a leaning into effort to overcome whatever state\\n\\none happens to be in to begin with.\\n\\nAnd so this is very important because it points to the fact\\n\\nthat yes, estrogen is activating aggression pathways\\n\\nthat are in the ventromedial hypothalamus,\\n\\nbut it\\'s very likely the case that testosterone\\n\\nis acting to accelerate or to bias states of mind and body\\n\\ntoward those that will lead to aggression.\\n\\nAgain, aggression is not like a switch on and off.\\n\\nIt\\'s a process.\\n\\nIt has a beginning, a middle, and an end.\\n\\nRemember that hydraulic pressure\\n\\nthat Conrad Lorenz hypothesized?\\n\\nWell, think of testosterone as increasing the pressure\\n\\ntoward an aggressive episode\\n\\nand then estrogen actually triggering that aggressive episode\\n\\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus.\\n\\nSo if somebody tells you that testosterone, endogenous,\\n\\nor exogenous makes people aggressive, tell them no.\\n\\nTestosterone tends to make people lean into effort.\\n\\nAnd if that effort involves being aggressive,\\n\\neither reactively aggressive or proactively aggressive,\\n\\nwell, then it will indeed lead to aggression,\\n\\nbut the actual aggression itself is triggered by estrogen,\\n\\nnot testosterone.\\n\\nNow thus far, we really haven\\'t talked too much\\n\\nabout the social context in which aggression occurs.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s because there is a near infinite,\\n\\nif not infinite number of variables\\n\\nthat will determine that.\\n\\nSo for instance, violent aggression is entirely appropriate\\n\\nat a professional boxing match,\\n\\nprovided it\\'s occurring inside the ring\\n\\nand only between the competitors\\n\\nand within the bounds of the rules of the sport, et cetera.\\n\\nHowever, there are some things that tend to bias\\n\\ncertain social contexts toward being more aggressive\\n\\nor less aggressive and not always physical aggression.\\n\\nAnd those generally come in two forms\\n\\nthat many of you are familiar with,\\n\\nwhich are alcohol and caffeine.\\n\\nLet\\'s discuss caffeine first.\\n\\nWhy would caffeine increase aggressive impulsivity?\\n\\nWell, the general effects of caffeine\\n\\nare to increase autonomic arousal,\\n\\nthe activity of the so-called sympathetic arm\\n\\nof the autonomic nervous system,\\n\\nwhich is, to put it very much in plain language,\\n\\nit\\'s the alertness arm of your nervous system.\\n\\nThat is, it creates a sense of readiness\\n\\nin your brain and body.\\n\\nAnd it does so by activating\\n\\nthe so-called sympathetic chain ganglia.\\n\\nAgain, as I always remind people,\\n\\nsimpa and sympathetic does not mean sympathy.\\n\\nSimpa means together or all at once.\\n\\nAnd caffeine tends to bias our brain and body\\n\\nto activate the sympathetic chain ganglia,\\n\\nwhich run from about the base of your neck\\n\\nuntil the top of your pelvis,\\n\\nand deploy a bunch of chemicals\\n\\nthat jut out into the rest of your body,\\n\\nactivate adrenaline release.\\n\\nThere\\'s a parallel increase of adrenaline in your brain,\\n\\ncreating the state of alertness and readiness.\\n\\nThat state of alertness and readiness\\n\\ncan be for all sorts of things, not just aggression.\\n\\nHowever, when we are in a state\\n\\nof increased sympathetic tone,\\n\\nmeaning more alert, such as after drinking caffeine,\\n\\nwe will bias all those brain and body systems,\\n\\nthe hormones, the chemicals, et cetera,\\n\\nthat exist toward action as opposed to inaction.\\n\\nSo put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity.\\n\\nNo surprise there.\\n\\nOn the opposite end of things,\\n\\nalcohol tends to decrease activity\\n\\nin the sympathetic arm or the autonomic nervous system,\\n\\ntends to make us feel less alert.\\n\\nNow, initially it can create a state of alertness\\n\\nbecause of its effects in inhibiting the forebrain.\\n\\nOur forebrain prefrontal cortex in particular\\n\\nhas what\\'s called top-down inhibition.\\n\\nIt exerts a inhibitory or a quieting effect\\n\\non some of the circuits of the hypothalamus,\\n\\nsuch as the ventromedial hypothalamus.\\n\\nThe way to conceptualize this is that your forebrain\\n\\nis able to rationalize and think clearly\\n\\nand to suppress behavior and to engage the no-go pathway.\\n\\nIt\\'s telling you, don\\'t say that mean thing.\\n\\nDon\\'t do that violent thing, et cetera.\\n\\nAlcohol initially tends to increase our level\\n\\nof overall activity by reducing inhibition,\\n\\nnot just in that forebrain circuit,\\n\\nbut in other circuits tends to make us more active.\\n\\nWe tend to talk more than we normally would,\\n\\nmove more than we normally would,\\n\\nbut very shortly thereafter starts acting as a sedative\\n\\nby way of reducing activity in the forebrain,\\n\\nreleasing some of the deeper brain circuits\\n\\nthat are involved in impulsivity,\\n\\nbut also causing a somewhat sedative of effect.\\n\\nAnd then of course, as alcohol levels increase even further,\\n\\npeople eventually will pass out, blackout, et cetera.\\n\\nSo what we\\'ve got with alcohol and caffeine\\n\\nis we\\'ve got two opposite ends of the spectrum,\\n\\ncaffeine increasing arousal and readiness\\n\\nand the tendency for impulsivity\\n\\nand alcohol also increasing impulsivity,\\n\\nbut through a different mechanism.\\n\\nA really interesting study,\\n\\nand I should just mention that the title of the study\\n\\nis caffeinated and non-caffeinated alcohol use\\n\\nand indirect aggression, the impact of self-regulation.\\n\\nSo the title is almost self-explanatory.\\n\\nThis was a paper published in the Journal\\n\\nof Addictive Behavior in 2016,\\n\\nexamining how ingestion of alcohol\\n\\nthat\\'s either caffeinated or non-caffeinated alcohol drinks\\n\\nimpacted what they call indirect aggression.\\n\\nAnd just to remind you what indirect aggression is,\\n\\nthese are not physical acts of aggression,\\n\\nthese are verbal acts of aggression.\\n\\nSo embarrassing others or otherwise somehow trying\\n\\nto reduce the wellbeing of others\\n\\nby saying certain things in particular in groups.\\n\\nThis study examined both males and females.\\n\\nThis was done by way of a college campus study.\\n\\nSubjects were 18 to 47 years old.\\n\\nI guess there\\'s some older students on that campus\\n\\nor maybe they use some non-students,\\n\\nbut these days you\\'ve also got some students\\n\\nthat are in their thirties and forties.\\n\\nSo they have a fairly broad swath of subjects included,\\n\\nfairly broad racial background as well,\\n\\nincluded not at equal numbers,\\n\\nbut at least they included a pretty broad spectrum\\n\\nof people with different backgrounds.\\n\\nThey looked in particular at people\\n\\nthat ingested non-caffeinated alcohol drinks\\n\\nat a frequency of 9.18 drinks per week.\\n\\nOkay, again, there\\'s a college campus,\\n\\nnot that I encourage that.\\n\\nI\\'m one of these people that I\\'ve never really liked.\\n\\nDrugs are alcohol and so we\\'re fortunate in that way.\\n\\nI can drink or not drink and tend to not drink.\\n\\nBut so to me, 9.18 drinks per week sounds like a lot,\\n\\nbut I know for some people that might actually be typical.\\n\\nAnd then others who were drinking\\n\\nat least one caffeinated alcoholic beverage per week.\\n\\nAnd those individuals end as high, I should say,\\n\\nas 7.87 caffeinated alcohol beverages per week.\\n\\nSo this would be energy drinks combined\\n\\ntypically with hard alcohol\\n\\nthat\\'s fairly commonly available in bars and so forth.\\n\\nAnd some individuals drank as much as, goodness,\\n\\n20.36 alcoholic drinks per week total,\\n\\nsome that were caffeinated, some that were not caffeinated.\\n\\nThe basic outcome of this study\\n\\nwas that the more alcohol someone tended to consume,\\n\\nthe more likely it was that they would engage\\n\\nin these indirect aggressive type behaviors.\\n\\nAnd in terms of the caffeinated alcoholic beverages,\\n\\nthere the effect was especially interesting.\\n\\nHere, I\\'m just going to paraphrase\\n\\nor I\\'ll actually read from the study.\\n\\nQuote, with regard to caffeinated alcoholic beverage use,\\n\\nour findings indicated\\n\\nthat heavier caffeinated alcohol beverage use\\n\\nwas associated positively with indirect aggression\\n\\neven after considering one\\'s typical alcohol use\\n\\nand dispositional aggression.\\n\\nWhat this means is that even though alcohol\\n\\ncan bias certain individuals to be more aggressive,\\n\\nand even though certain individuals\\n\\nalready have a disposition toward being more aggressive,\\n\\nthere was an effect that was independent,\\n\\nmeaning above and beyond both alcohol and a predisposition,\\n\\nmeaning if someone was consuming caffeinated alcoholic\\n\\nbeverages, they had a particularly high likelihood\\n\\nof engaging in indirect aggressive behavior.\\n\\nNow, this makes perfect sense\\n\\nin light of the model they propose,\\n\\nwhich is this self-regulation model\\n\\nthat basically self-regulation involves several things.\\n\\nIt involves engaging in certain behaviors\\n\\nand suppressing other behaviors.\\n\\nSo as described before,\\n\\nbecause alcohol tends to have a sedative,\\n\\nsuppressive effect on the autonomic nervous system,\\n\\nat least after the initial period,\\n\\nit\\'s going to tend to reduce the likelihood\\n\\nthat people will engage in any type of behavior,\\n\\nwhereas caffeine will increase autonomic arousal\\n\\nand increase the likelihood\\n\\nthat someone will engage in a particular type of behavior,\\n\\naggressive or otherwise.\\n\\nSo the combination of caffeine and alcohol\\n\\nis really acting as a two-prong system\\n\\nto bias people towards more impulsivity,\\n\\nthat is less self-regulation.\\n\\nSo it\\'s really yanking your volitional control,\\n\\nyour ability to engage in prefrontal top-down inhibition\\n\\nover your hypothalamus\\n\\nfrom two distinct and specific circuits.\\n\\nBy now, you should be getting the impression\\n\\nthat self-regulation is a key feature\\n\\nof whether or not somebody, maybe even you,\\n\\nis going to engage in aggressive speech\\n\\nor aggressive behavior.\\n\\nAnd we\\'ve talked about a number of tools\\n\\nthat one can use to reduce the probability\\n\\nthat that will happen.\\n\\nI suppose if the context were appropriate,\\n\\nyou could even take those tool recommendations\\n\\nand just invert them and increase the likelihood\\n\\nthat aggressiveness would happen.\\n\\nBut regardless, self-regulation is key.\\n\\nAnd in light of that, I want to share with you a study\\n\\nthat\\'s focused on kids,\\n\\nbut that has important ramifications for adults as well.\\n\\nAs you probably are already aware,\\n\\nthere are many kids out there that suffer\\n\\nfrom so-called attention deficit\\n\\nhyperactivity disorder, ADHD.\\n\\nThere are also many adults we are finding\\n\\nthat are suffering from ADHD.\\n\\nAnd there is also an epidemic, I would say,\\n\\nof people that are concerned\\n\\nabout whether or not they have ADHD.\\n\\nNow, whether or not they have true clinical ADHD or not\\n\\nis not clear.\\n\\nWe did an episode all about ADHD and tools for ADHD.\\n\\nI would encourage you to check out that episode\\n\\nand some of the diagnostic criteria.\\n\\nIf you have the opportunity,\\n\\nyou can find that at hubermanlab.com.\\n\\nAs this study I\\'m about to share with you aptly points out,\\n\\nthere is no objective diagnostic marker of ADHD.\\n\\nThere\\'s no biomarker or blood draw or blood test for ADHD.\\n\\nWhether or not one has ADHD depends on their performance\\n\\non a number of different cognitive tests\\n\\nand behavioral tests and self-report.\\n\\nIn any event, the study I\\'m about to share with you\\n\\nexplored how a particular pattern of supplementation\\n\\nin kids with ADHD was able to reduce aggressive episodes\\n\\nand impulsivity and increase self-regulation.\\n\\nAnd the title of the study is efficacy of carnitine\\n\\nin the treatment of children\\n\\nwith attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\\n\\nEven though they put carnitine in the title,\\n\\nthat what they focused on was whether or not\\n\\nacetyl-L-carnitine supplementation\\n\\ncould somehow adjust the behavioral tendency\\n\\nof these kids with ADHD.\\n\\nAnd to make a long story short, indeed it did.\\n\\nThere was a very significant effect\\n\\nof acetyl-carnitine supplementation\\n\\non improving some of the symptomology of ADHD.\\n\\nA few details about the study that might be relevant to you.\\n\\nThis was a randomized double-blind placebo control\\n\\ndouble crossover study.\\n\\nThis was done as an outpatient study.\\n\\nSo the kids weren\\'t in a hospital.\\n\\nThey were living out in the world.\\n\\nThis again was done on younger kids.\\n\\nSo this was six to 13 year old kids\\n\\nthat were diagnosed with ADHD.\\n\\nThey received either acetyl-L-carnitine or placebo.\\n\\nAnd they did all the good practice stuff\\n\\nthat good researchers do of making sure\\n\\nthat the placebo and the acetyl-L-carnitine\\n\\nhad similar look and taste.\\n\\nIt was consumed twice daily after meals.\\n\\nNow she just mentioned that acetyl-L-carnitine\\n\\ntypically is taken in capsule form\\n\\nor occasionally in injectable form here.\\n\\nThey were using this as a drink,\\n\\nwhich is essentially the same as capsule form,\\n\\nbut the powder is just going directly into liquid.\\n\\nAnd the carnitine dosage was 100 milligrams per kilogram.\\n\\nSo they\\'re doing this according to the body weight\\n\\nof these kids with a maximum dosage of four grams per day.\\n\\nThe quantity of the medication was supplied here.\\n\\nI\\'m reading for a period of eight weeks\\n\\nand every eight weeks a new quantity\\n\\nof medication was supplied.\\n\\nSo basically this is a fairly long-term study\\n\\nexploring behavioral outcomes\\n\\nand psychological outcomes in week eight, 16 and 24.\\n\\nThey also looked at things\\n\\nthat you could only get through a blood draw.\\n\\nSo things like hemoglobin, hematocrit,\\n\\nred blood cell count, white blood cell count, et cetera.\\n\\nThese are kids and even if it were adults,\\n\\nthey were quite appropriately examining\\n\\na lot of the physiological measures\\n\\nthat one would want to carry out\\n\\nto make sure first of all,\\n\\nthat blood levels of carnitine are increasing\\n\\nand indeed they confirm that,\\n\\nbut also that no negative effects are showing up\\n\\nin the physiology as well as the psychology of these kids.\\n\\nSo first I\\'ll just tell you the basic outcome of the study,\\n\\nwhich was here I\\'m paraphrasing,\\n\\ngiven twice daily carnitine appeared to be effective\\n\\nand well-tolerated treatment for a group of children\\n\\nwith ADHD, they showed significantly abnormal behavior\\n\\ncompared to these other boys.\\n\\nAnd now I\\'m moving to the table of results.\\n\\nThey showed significant reductions\\n\\nin their so-called total problem score.\\n\\nThe total problem score is a well-established measure\\n\\nof behavioral problems in kids with ADHD.\\n\\nAnd I should say adults with ADHD has to do\\n\\nwith challenges in social and learning environments\\n\\nand how well or poorly an individual tends to perform.\\n\\nReductions in attentional problems overall,\\n\\nreductions in delinquency\\n\\nand most important for sake of today\\'s discussion,\\n\\nsignificant reductions in aggressive behavior.\\n\\nNow, what\\'s especially nice about this study, I think,\\n\\nis that even though it was a relatively small number\\n\\nof subjects and certainly needs to be repeated\\n\\nin other studies and other laboratories,\\n\\nthat they were able to confirm the shifts in L-carnitine\\n\\nwithin the bloodstream of these kids.\\n\\nThat is they were able to correlate the physiology\\n\\nwith the psychological changes.\\n\\nIn studies like this, and frankly,\\n\\nin all studies of human pharmacology,\\n\\nyou have to worry about effects that show up,\\n\\nnot just because of placebo effects,\\n\\nbut because of so-called off-target effects\\n\\nor related things totally independent of the drug\\n\\nor the particular supplement\\n\\nthat you happen to be looking at.\\n\\nTo put it in the words of a great neuroscientist,\\n\\nunfortunately, he passed away some years ago,\\n\\nbut he was a member of the National Academy,\\n\\nextremely accomplished neuroscientist,\\n\\nonce turned to me and said,\\n\\nnever forget a drug is a substance\\n\\nthat when injected into an animal or a human being,\\n\\ncreates a paper.\\n\\nMeaning you can see effects of pretty much any drug\\n\\nor any supplement in most all conditions.\\n\\nHowever, it is in cases such as this study\\n\\nwhere you can quite convincingly see\\n\\nthat the particular feature of physiology\\n\\nthat you expected to change actually changed.\\n\\nAnd you see a psychological outcome\\n\\nthat you can gain much greater confidence\\n\\nthat the changes in delinquency,\\n\\nin this case, reduced delinquency, improved attention,\\n\\nreduced aggressiveness and so forth,\\n\\nwas at least somehow related to the shift\\n\\nin blood physiology and levels of L-carnitine\\n\\nor acetyl L-carnitine and carnitine\\n\\nin the bloodstream of these children,\\n\\nas opposed to something else like L-carnitine going\\n\\nand affecting some downstream target\\n\\nthat you have no knowledge of.\\n\\nNow, of course, that\\'s still entirely possible,\\n\\nbut I think studies such as these increase our confidence\\n\\nthat things like L-carnitine can be used perhaps\\n\\nin concert with things like omega-3 supplementation,\\n\\ndiets that are biased towards increasing more tryptophan\\n\\nand therefore more serotonin,\\n\\nobviously avoiding things like alcohol.\\n\\nAnd as it appears from the study I just described,\\n\\nreducing one\\'s intake or not consuming\\n\\nany caffeinated alcoholic beverages,\\n\\nseems like it would be a good idea\\n\\nif your goal is to reduce aggressiveness,\\n\\nto think about the hormone context.\\n\\nAnd whether or not you tend to have higher testosterone\\n\\nand estrogen or lower testosterone and estrogen,\\n\\nmaybe even think about the work environment,\\n\\nwhether or not you are existing\\n\\nin a particularly competitive work environment\\n\\nand even daylife, time of year,\\n\\nand whether or not you\\'re getting sufficient sunlight,\\n\\nwhether or not you\\'re avoiding light\\n\\nin the evening and so on.\\n\\nSo studies such as this, I think are useful\\n\\nbecause they point to the fact that very seldom, if ever,\\n\\nwill there be one supplement or one nutritional change\\n\\nor even one behavioral change\\n\\nthat\\'s going to completely shift an individual\\n\\nfrom being aggressive and impulsive,\\n\\nbut rather that by combining different behavioral regimens,\\n\\nby paying attention to things like time of year\\n\\nand work conditions and school conditions\\n\\nand overall levels of stress\\n\\nand likely therefore levels of cortisol, et cetera,\\n\\nthat you can use behaviors, diet and supplementation\\n\\nas a way to shift that overall internal milieu\\n\\nfrom one of providing a lot of internal hydraulic pressure\\n\\nas it\\'s been called throughout the episode\\n\\ntoward aggressive impulsivity\\n\\nand relax some of that hydraulic pressure\\n\\nand reduce aggressive tendencies.\\n\\nSo once again, and frankly, as always,\\n\\nwe\\'ve done a deep dive into the neurobiology\\n\\nand the psychology of what I believe\\n\\nto be an important feature of our lives,\\n\\nin this case, aggression.\\n\\nI want to point out that in a episode\\n\\nin the not too distant future,\\n\\nI\\'m going to be hosting Dr. Professor David Anderson\\n\\nfrom Caltech University,\\n\\nwho is the world expert on the neurobiology of aggression.\\n\\nIn fact, he is the senior author on many of the studies\\n\\nrelated to the ventromedial hypothalamus\\n\\nthat I discussed today.\\n\\nOur discussion will touch on aggression, of course.\\n\\nSo hearing today\\'s episode\\n\\nwill help you digest that information,\\n\\nbut we are also going to talk about other emotional states.\\n\\nHe is an expert not just in aggression,\\n\\nbut in motivated states related to sex\\n\\nand mating behavior, social relationships of all kinds,\\n\\nand how those relate not just to biology and psychology,\\n\\nbut also certain forms of pathology, things like PTSD\\n\\nand the relationship, for instance,\\n\\nbetween anger, fear, anxiety, and depression,\\n\\nand many other important topics that I know many of you,\\n\\nif not all of you, will be interested in.\\n\\nIn the meantime, I want to point you\\n\\nto his recently released and wonderful book\\n\\nentitled The Nature of the Beast, How Emotions Guide Us.\\n\\nAnd again, the author is David Anderson from Caltech.\\n\\nThis is a wonderful book.\\n\\nIt serves as a tremendous introduction\\n\\nto the history of the study of these areas,\\n\\nthe current science and discoveries\\n\\nbeing made in these areas,\\n\\nall made accessible to the scientist and non-scientist alike.\\n\\nIt\\'s a very engaging read.\\n\\nAnd so much so that even though he was gracious\\n\\nin sending me a copy,\\n\\nI also purchased myself a copy\\n\\nto give to somebody who is a therapist,\\n\\nand I\\'ve purchased another copy\\n\\nto give to a high school kid that I mentor\\n\\nbecause he\\'s very interested in the neuroscience of emotions.\\n\\nAnd I think we are all interested in emotions,\\n\\nnot just fear and some of these negative states,\\n\\nnot just aggression,\\n\\nbut also the positive emotions of our lives.\\n\\nAnd so The Nature of the Beast,\\n\\nHow Emotions Guide Us by David Anderson\\n\\nis a wonderful read.\\n\\nI can\\'t recommend it highly enough.\\n\\nIf you\\'re learning from and or

       " Document(page_content=\"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\n\\nwhere we discuss science\\n\\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\\n\\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\\n\\nand I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology\\n\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\n\\nToday we are discussing psilocybin.\\n\\nPsilocybin is a psychedelic, meaning it modifies the psyche.\\n\\nAnd in doing so, it changes our level of consciousness.\\n\\nPsychedelics such as psilocybin change the way\\n\\nthat we perceive the outside world\\n\\nand our internal world, our memories, our thoughts,\\n\\nour feelings, et cetera,\\n\\nnot just while one is under the influence of psilocybin,\\n\\nbut it can also fundamentally change\\n\\nall of those things afterwards\\n\\nand for a very long period of time afterwards as well,\\n\\nwhich is one of the reasons why there's growing excitement\\n\\nabout the application of psilocybin and other psychedelics\\n\\nfor the treatment of various mental health issues,\\n\\nsuch as depression, alcohol abuse disorder,\\n\\nand addictions of various kinds,\\n\\nas well as things like OCD and eating disorders.\\n\\nToday we will discuss psilocybin,\\n\\ntalking about what it is.\\n\\nIn fact, you may be surprised to learn\\n\\nthat psilocybin basically is serotonin.\\n\\nNow, for those of you that are familiar\\n\\nwith psilocybin and serotonin,\\n\\nyou might think, wait, that's not true.\\n\\nBut in fact, psilocybin's main effect\\n\\nis to mimic serotonin,\\n\\nbut it does it in a very specific way\\n\\nbecause it activates a subset of serotonin receptors\\n\\nin a very strong fashion,\\n\\nleading to neuroplasticity\\n\\nat the level of the neural circuits,\\n\\nthat is the brain areas and connections\\n\\nthat serve things like memory and perception.\\n\\nSo if any of that is confusing at this point,\\n\\nI promise to make it all clear in just a few minutes.\\n\\nPsilocybin is one of many psychedelics, of course.\\n\\nThere are things like LSD, DMT, 5-MeO, DMT,\\n\\neven MDMA, while not considered a classic psychedelic,\\n\\nis considered a psychedelic in the general sense.\\n\\nToday's episode is going to focus\\n\\non psilocybin in particular.\\n\\nI will tell you what psilocybin is,\\n\\nhow it works at the molecular and cellular level.\\n\\nI'll talk about how it changes brain circuitry.\\n\\nI'll talk about the clinical effects,\\n\\nwhat's been demonstrated in controlled laboratory studies.\\n\\nI'll talk about dosages and translating\\n\\nfrom psilocybin mushrooms to actual psilocybin,\\n\\nand the compound that actually exerts\\n\\nthe effects of psilocybin,\\n\\nwhich it turns out is not psilocybin,\\n\\nbut something called psilocin.\\n\\nPsilocin is the actual compound that goes into the brain\\n\\nto create all the changes in consciousness\\n\\nand all the rewiring effects\\n\\nthat we associate with psilocybin.\\n\\nSo understanding how psilocybin is converted to psilocin\\n\\nhas tremendous impact on the duration\\n\\nof a psilocybin journey,\\n\\nwhether or not that psilocybin journey\\n\\nis going to lead to a short or longer window\\n\\nfor neuroplasticity.\\n\\nIn fact, many people don't realize this,\\n\\nbut much of the positive changes that are possible\\n\\nwith proper, and I do want to underscore,\\n\\nproper psilocybin therapeutic approaches\\n\\ntakes place after the session\\n\\nin which one feels all the typical\\n\\nor typically associated effects of psilocybin,\\n\\nlike hallucinations and changes\\n\\nin thought patterns, et cetera.\\n\\nSo today we are going to talk a little bit about chemistry,\\n\\nbut I promise to make it accessible to anyone and everyone,\\n\\nregardless of whether or not you have a background\\n\\nin chemistry or biology.\\n\\nWe're going to talk about some cell biology,\\n\\nthe actual neuronal changes that occur\\n\\nwhen one takes psilocybin,\\n\\nand we're going to talk about how neural circuits\\n\\nchange over time and how all of that impacts the changes\\n\\nthat most people are interested in\\n\\nwhen they go on a psilocybin journey,\\n\\nthings such as longstanding improvements in mood,\\n\\nthings such as tremendous insight into themselves\\n\\nand to others, into their past, their present,\\n\\nand their future,\\n\\nand even changes in their levels of creativity\\n\\nor their ability to experience joy from music\\n\\nor their ability to dissociate in a positive way\\n\\nfrom things that formerly were depressing\\n\\nor triggers for depression.\\n\\nIn fact, we're going to talk quite a lot\\n\\nabout the conditions inside of a psilocybin journey\\n\\nthat make it actually positive and therapeutic.\\n\\nThis is a very important point\\n\\nthat I'll make several times throughout today's episode,\\n\\nwhich is that just because something\\n\\ninvokes neuroplasticity, changes in brain circuitry,\\n\\ndoes not mean that it's therapeutic,\\n\\nor I should say does not necessarily mean\\n\\nthat it's therapeutic.\\n\\nFor neuroplasticity to be therapeutic,\\n\\nit has to be adaptive.\\n\\nIt has to allow someone to function better in life\\n\\nthan they did previously.\\n\\nSo today we will talk about\\n\\nhow the conditions of a psilocybin journey,\\n\\nincluding whether or not it's done with eyes closed\\n\\nor eyes open, or whether or not people alternate\\n\\nbetween eyes closed and eyes open phases of that journey,\\n\\nas well as whether or not music is played\\n\\nduring that journey,\\n\\nand even what types of music are played\\n\\nwill dictate whether or not somebody will feel better\\n\\nor worse in the days and weeks and years\\n\\nfollowing that psilocybin journey,\\n\\nas well as the dosage level,\\n\\nbecause as you'll soon learn as well,\\n\\nthere are clinical studies showing\\n\\nthat just one psilocybin journey\\n\\ncan improve mood in a longstanding way,\\n\\nbut most clinical trials involve two dosages,\\n\\nspaced in very precise ways from one another\\n\\nwith appropriate follow-up,\\n\\nbut in both of those particular journeys,\\n\\nthe structure of the journey,\\n\\nwho's present, who's not present,\\n\\neyes open or eyes closed,\\n\\nthe particular music that's played,\\n\\nall of those features make up part\\n\\nof a larger neuroplasticity trigger\\n\\nof which psilocybin is critical,\\n\\nbut psilocybin is not the only variable.\\n\\nSo whether or not you're interested\\n\\nin participating in a clinical study\\n\\nor whether or not you're interested in psilocybin\\n\\nfor other reasons,\\n\\nthis is critical information to understand.\\n\\nSo today we're going to talk about\\n\\nnearly every feature of psilocybin possible,\\n\\nincluding what psilocybin is,\\n\\nhow it works at the level of chemistry,\\n\\ncell biology and neural networks and neuroplasticity.\\n\\nWe'll talk about the clinical studies,\\n\\nwe'll talk about dosages,\\n\\nwe will talk about conditions of clinical studies\\n\\nand we will talk about the post psilocybin journey period\\n\\nin which neuroplasticity and the various activities,\\n\\nincluding therapy or perhaps not therapy,\\n\\ncan contribute to positive therapeutic changes\\n\\nfrom psilocybin.\\n\\nNow, as we go into this discussion,\\n\\nI do want to underscore the fact that\\n\\nat the time of recording this episode,\\n\\nmeaning now, May, 2023,\\n\\npsilocybin is still a schedule one drug.\\n\\nIt is considered illegal in the United States.\\n\\nThere's perhaps just one exception to that,\\n\\nmaybe a few others,\\n\\nbut the main exception is in the state of Oregon,\\n\\npsilocybin has been approved\\n\\nin particular therapeutic settings\\n\\nfor use in particular conditions,\\n\\nnamely depression and some forms of addiction.\\n\\nSo in Oregon, it's more or less in the domain\\n\\nof a decriminalized as opposed to actually legal.\\n\\nIn other areas of the country,\\n\\nincluding Oakland, California,\\n\\nthere's some areas in which it has been decriminalized\\n\\nand perhaps there are a few others that I'm not aware of,\\n\\nbut in general, psilocybin and other psychedelics\\n\\nare still considered illegal.\\n\\nAnd this is very important,\\n\\nnot just saying this to protect me,\\n\\nI'm saying this to protect you,\\n\\npossessing or certainly selling psilocybin\\n\\nexcept for rare instances such as clinical studies\\n\\nand these decriminalized areas\\n\\nthat I talked about a moment ago\\n\\nis still very much not allowed under the law.\\n\\nToday, I'll also discuss safety issues.\\n\\nI'll talk about whether or not young people,\\n\\nmeaning people 25 or younger should consider psilocybin\\n\\ngiven that their brain is still in a rampant period\\n\\nof naturally occurring neuroplasticity.\\n\\nI will also talk about dosages\\n\\nas it relates to people who have formerly been on\\n\\nor may currently be on different forms of antidepressants.\\n\\nAnd I will talk about people who are at risk\\n\\nfor psychotic episodes,\\n\\neither because they know they themselves\\n\\nhave a propensity for psychosis\\n\\nor they have close family members who have psychosis,\\n\\nwhich includes things like schizophrenia,\\n\\nbipolar depression,\\n\\nas well as things like borderline personality\\n\\nand some related psychiatric conditions.\\n\\nSo today's episode really will be a deep dive\\n\\ninto psilocybin.\\n\\nSo whether or not you think you're already familiar\\n\\nwith psilocybin and its effects\\n\\nor whether or not you're just curious about them,\\n\\nI do encourage, if you're willing,\\n\\nto try and ratchet through some of the understanding\\n\\nof how psilocybin works and what it is,\\n\\nleading up to some of the therapeutic applications\\n\\nand different patterns of dosing,\\n\\nspacing of different sessions, et cetera,\\n\\nbecause I do believe that with that knowledge in hand,\\n\\nyou will be able to make far better,\\n\\nmuch more informed decisions about whether or not\\n\\npsilocybin is right for you.\\n\\nBefore we begin,\\n\\nI'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate\\n\\nfrom my teaching and research roles at Stanford.\\n\\nIt is, however, part of my desire and effort\\n\\nto bring zero cost to consumer information about science\\n\\nand science-related tools to the general public.\\n\\nIn keeping with that theme,\\n\\nI'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.\\n\\nOur first sponsor is 8 Sleep.\\n\\n8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating\\n\\nand sleep tracking capacity.\\n\\nNow, sleep is the foundation of mental health,\\n\\nphysical health and performance.\\n\\nEverything goes far better when we are sleeping well\\n\\non a consistent basis.\\n\\nNow, one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep\\n\\nis to make sure that the temperature\\n\\nof your sleeping environment is correct.\\n\\nIn fact, your body temperature has to drop\\n\\nby one to three degrees in order to fall asleep\\n\\nand stay deeply asleep.\\n\\nAnd waking up involves a heating up of your body\\n\\nby about one to three degrees.\\n\\nWith 8 Sleep, you can program your mattress\\n\\nto be a specific temperature at the beginning, middle\\n\\nand towards the end of your sleep night.\\n\\nEver since I started sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress,\\n\\nI've slept far better than I ever have.\\n\\nSo it's an all around great tool\\n\\nthat has tremendous functionality,\\n\\nnot just for measuring, but for improving your

absolute highest quality.\\n\\nNow I've spent a lifetime working on the biology,\\n\\nthe visual system, and I can tell you\\n\\nthat your visual system has to contend\\n\\nwith an enormous number of challenges\\n\\nin order to make sure that you can see clearly\\n\\nunder any conditions.\\n\\nRoca understands all of that\\n\\nand has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses\\n\\nso that regardless of whether or not\\n\\nyou're in a very brightly lit area or a more shady area,\\n\\nor you go from brightly lit to shady areas,\\n\\nyou can always see with tremendous clarity.\\n\\nNow, even though they were initially designed for sport,\\n\\nRoca eyeglasses and sunglasses come\\n\\nin a tremendous number of different aesthetics.\\n\\nSo they have the kind of what I call cyborg

to focus specifically\\n\\non psilocybin and we're going to set aside\\n\\nall the other psychedelics for future episodes.\\n\\nPsilocybin is what's called a tryptamine.\\n\\nThat refers to its chemical composition,\\n\\nnot to the so-called psychedelic tryp.\\n\\nIn fact, it's spelled differently.\\n\\nTryptamine is T-R-Y-P, trypt-R-I-P, of course.\\n\\nTryptamines include psilocybin,\\n\\nbut also things like DMT and 5MAO-DMT.\\n\\nThe tryptamine psychedelics\\n\\nvery closely resemble serotonin itself.\\n\\nThat's right.\\n\\nMost of you have probably heard of the chemical serotonin.\\n\\nAnd serotonin is what's called a neuromodulator,\\n\\nwhich means your brain and body naturally make it\\n\\nand that it modifies or changes the activity\\n\\nof other neurons and neural circuits.\\n\\nAnd it does that generally by either increasing\\n\\nor decreasing the activity of those neural circuits.\\n\\nIf I were to show you a picture\\n\\nof the chemical structure of psilocybin\\n\\nor its active derivative, psilocin,\\n\\nand I were to also put right alongside it\\n\\nan image of the chemical structure of serotonin,\\n\\nprovided that you weren't a chemist\\n\\nwho really likes to focus\\n\\non the detailed differences between things,\\n\\nyou would say those look very similar.\\n\\nAnd indeed psilocybin and its active form, psilocin,\\n\\nare very similar structurally and chemically\\n\\nto serotonin itself.\\n\\nNow, as I mentioned before, serotonin is something\\n\\nthat you naturally make.\\n\\nAnd yes, it's true that about 90% of the serotonin\\n\\nin your brain and body is manufactured in your gut.\\n\\nHowever, contrary to popular belief,\\n\\nthe serotonin in your brain is not manufactured\\n\\nfrom the serotonin in your gut.\\n\\nYou have separate independent sources of serotonin.\\n\\nThat is you have particular neurons\\n\\nthat make serotonin in your brain.\\n\\nYou also have serotonin in your gut\\n\\nand those work more or less in parallel separately.\\n\\nNow, what does serotonin do?\\n\\nThis is really important to understand\\n\\nbecause of the similarity between psilocybin\\n\\nand its active form, psilocin and serotonin.\\n\\nSerotonin in that it's a neuromodulator,\\n\\nchanges the activity of other neurons\\n\\nand the net effects of those changes\\n\\nare things that you're familiar with.\\n\\nFor instance, satiety or the feeling\\n\\nthat we've had enough of various things,\\n\\nsuch as food or a social interaction or sex\\n\\nor pleasure of any kind.\\n\\nSerotonin is involved in all of that\\n\\nand an enormous number of other things,\\n\\nsuch as mood regulation,\\n\\nsuch as our sense of pleasure itself or lack of pleasure,\\n\\nsuch as whether or not we feel motivated or not motivated.\\n\\nIt works in concert with other neuromodulators,\\n\\nsuch as dopamine and epinephrine and norepinephrine.\\n\\nIn fact, if this were an episode about serotonin,\\n\\nwhich it is not, you would soon realize\\n\\nthat serotonin is involved in so many different functions\\n\\nthat impact our daily life.\\n\\nAnd that is one reason why\\n\\ncertain antidepressant medications,\\n\\nwhich alter either increase or decrease\\n\\nthe amount of serotonin transmission in the brain,\\n\\nwill often have a lot of side effects related\\n\\nto things like mood, libido, appetite, sleep, et cetera.\\n\\nIt's because serotonin is involved\\n\\nin so many different things.\\n\\nAnd serotonin is involved in so many different things\\n\\nbecause there are a lot of different\\n\\nso-called serotonin receptors.\\n\\nSerotonin is a chemical that we call a ligand,\\n\\nand the chemical ligand is simply the thing\\n\\nthat plugs into the receptor for that chemical or ligand.\\n\\nThe receptors, in this case serotonin receptors,\\n\\nhave the opportunity to do all sorts of different things.\\n\\nThey can change the activity of neurons,\\n\\nmaking them more active or less active.\\n\\nThey can cause growth factors to be released,\\n\\nmaking sure that those neurons reinforce\\n\\nor even build up stronger connections\\n\\nso that they're more likely to be active in the future.\\n\\nSerotonin binding to particular receptors\\n\\ncan even change the gene expression in particular cells,\\n\\nmaking those cells proliferate, so make more of them,\\n\\nmaking those cells more robust, making those cells,\\n\\nthey interact with new elements of the brain and body.\\n\\nBasically, serotonin and all these different receptors\\n\\nthat it binds to has dozens, if not hundreds,\\n\\nand maybe even thousands of different functions.\\n\\nSo the fact that psilocybin so closely resembles serotonin\\n\\nleads to a very important question\\n\\nthat we should all be asking ourselves,\\n\\nwhich is why is it that psilocybin,\\n\\nwhich looks so much like serotonin,\\n\\nwhen one takes it in the form of magic mushrooms\\n\\nor some other form, maybe the synthetic form\\n\\nof psilocybin itself, which nowadays is manufactured\\n\\nin laboratories and placed in different psilocybin\\n\\ncontaining foods and pills, et cetera,\\n\\nwhy that leads to complex yet fairly circumscribed sets\\n\\nof experience like visual and auditory hallucinations,\\n\\nchanges in particular thought patterns\\n\\nand neuroplasticity that, in many cases,\\n\\nin the clinical setting, provided things are done correctly,\\n\\nimprovements in mood, relief from depression,\\n\\nrelief from various compulsive disorders, et cetera, right?\\n\\nThis is really what you need to understand\\n\\nif you want to understand psilocybin and how it works\\n\\nand how to make it work optimally\\n\\nfor a given condition or goal.\\n\\nYou have to understand what it's actually doing\\n\\nand what allows psilocybin to do fairly specific things\\n\\nin comparison to serotonin,\\n\\neven though psilocybin and serotonin are so similar,\\n\\nis that psilocybin mainly binds to\\n\\nand activates the so-called serotonin 2A receptor.\\n\\nThe serotonin 2A receptor is one of, again,\\n\\nmany different serotonin receptors,\\n\\nbut serotonin 2A is expressed\\n\\nin particular areas of the brain\\n\\nand even on particular areas of neurons in the brain\\n\\nthat allow for very specific types of changes\\n\\nin neural circuitry to take place,\\n\\nnot just when one is under the influence of psilocybin,\\n\\nbut afterwards as well.\\n\\nSo really, in order to have a useful discussion\\n\\nabout psilocybin, we need to talk a lot\\n\\nabout the serotonin 2A receptor.\\n\\nBut fortunately for you,\\n\\nunless you're somebody really interested\\n\\nin structural biology or cell biology,\\n\\nthat discussion is not going to be\\n\\nabout the binding pocket for serotonin\\n\\non serotonin 2A receptor\\n\\nor a lot of the downstream signaling\\n\\nof the serotonin 2A receptor.\\n\\nWe'll talk a little bit about that where it's relevant,\\n\\nbut more importantly,\\n\\nat least for sake of today's discussion,\\n\\nwe're going to talk about how the serotonin 2A receptor\\n\\nis really the one responsible\\n\\nfor triggering all the changes in neural circuitry\\n\\nthat lead to the changes,\\n\\nthat is the improvements in mood,\\n\\nthe relief from compulsive disorders in many cases,\\n\\nbut really it's the serotonin 2A receptor selectivity\\n\\nof psilocybin that is leading to all the excitement\\n\\nthat you hear about in terms of psilocybin\\n\\nas a therapeutic tool.\\n\\nLet me say that from a slightly different angle.\\n\\nThere are data that I'll talk about today,\\n\\nwhich show that one, although in most cases,\\n\\ntwo psilocybin journeys done with particular dosages\\n\\nof psilocybin lead to maximal binding or occupancy\\n\\nof those serotonin 2A receptors\\n\\nin ways that lead to significant\\n\\nand unprecedented relief for major depression.\\n\\nIn fact, you'll soon learn that the clinical trials\\n\\nfor psilocybin are outperforming standard therapy\\n\\nand outperforming so-called SSRIs\\n\\nand various other antidepressants\\n\\nin terms of providing depression relief\\n\\nin ways that are frankly staggering, not just to me,\\n\\nbut to the psychiatric community at large.\\n\\nAnd this is where so much of the excitement is coming from.\\n\\nNow, that statement could be taken one way,\\n\\nwhich is to just say, okay, well,\\n\\nhere's a compound psilocybin that outperforms SSRIs,\\n\\nand therefore all the attention should be on psilocybin.\\n\\nBut SSRI stands for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.\\n\\nIn other words, the SSRIs,\\n\\nof which there's now a lot of controversy,\\n\\nthings like Prozac, Zoloft, et cetera.\\n\\nI'm sure you've heard some of this controversy.\\n\\nThere are people who are very pro SSRIs,\\n\\nalthough there are a growing number of people\\n\\nwho really feel that the SSRIs are probably most appropriate\\n\\nfor things like obsessive compulsive disorder,\\n\\nwhere they in fact can be very beneficial.\\n\\nBut there's a lot of kind of leaning back from SSRIs\\n\\nas the be all end all\\n\\nfor the treatment of depression nowadays\\n\\nbecause of the side effect profiles.\\n\\nAnd the fact that it's not even really clear\\n\\nthat serotonin deficiencies are the major cause\\n\\nof depression in the first place.\\n\\nNow, again, we're talking about psilocybin,\\n\\nnot about SSRIs, but you should be thinking,\\n\\nwait, how is it that two molecules,\\n\\npsilocybin and some particular SSRI,\\n\\nboth of which look like\\n\\nand or increase serotonin transmission in the brain\\n\\nare leading to either incredibly positive\\n\\nand interesting outcomes,\\n\\nor to kind of troubling side effect riddled outcomes.\\n\\nAnd again, it all boils back down to the selectivity\\n\\nof psilocybin to bind that serotonin to a receptor.\\n\\nAnd so in order to understand how psilocybin works\\n\\nand in order to understand proper dosing profiles\\n\\nand spacing of sessions, AKA journeys,\\n\\nwe really need to talk a little bit more\\n\\nabout the serotonin 2A receptor,\\n\\nwhere it is in the brain,\\n\\nwhat sorts of things happen\\n\\nwhen psilocybin binds the serotonin 2A receptor\\n\\nand how those things set in motion,\\n\\nthe various changes, the neuroplasticity\\n\\nthat allows people to feel better in terms of their mood.\\n\\nAnd as you'll soon learn,\\n\\ncan experience more pleasure and joy\\n\\nfrom things like music and enhanced creativity,\\n\\nall the things that I do believe,\\n\\nwhether or not people are thinking about\\n\\nor maybe even exploring psilocybin\\n\\nfor recreational or therapeutic purposes,\\n\\nall the things that people want\\n\\nand are really talking about\\n\\nand perhaps even doing psilocybin in order to obtain.\\n\\nSo before going any further,\\n\\nI just want to place an image in your mind.\\n\\nYou can place an image in your mind\\n\\nwhereby when serotonin is released in the brain naturally,\\n\\nnot having taken any compound, any drug, anything,\\n\\nit's getting released at a lot of different sites,\\n\\nbinding to a lot of different serotonin receptors,\\n\\ndoing a lot of different things.\\n\\nWhen somebody takes an SSRI,\\n\\nthe net effect of that selective serotonin\\n\\nreuptake inhibitor is that there's more serotonin around\\n\\nto exert its effects.\\n\\nBecause it's a reuptake inhibitor at the synapse,\\n\\nthe connections between neurons,\\n\\nthe serotonin can do its thing more extensively\\n\\nand for longer periods of time,\\n\\nbut it's doing it kind of non-specifically.\\n\\nSo when you think about standard antidepressant treatments,\\n\\nat least for sake of this discussion,\\n\\nyou kind of think of a sprinkling\\n\\nor a kind of spraying of serotonin\\n\\nat different locations in the brain\\n\\nand binding to lots of different receptors.\\n\\nWhereas when you think about psilocybin,\\n\\neven though the subjective effects are pretty diverse,\\n\\nwe'll talk about those in a few moments,\\n\\nwhat you're really talking about is a molecule psilocybin\\n\\nthat looks a lot like serotonin that is selectively\\n\\nand very strongly binding to and activating\\n\\nthat serotonin 2A receptor.\\n\\nSo that's the image I'd like you to embed in your mind.\\n\\nAnd then the next image I'd like you to embed in your mind\\n\\nis where these serotonin 2A receptors\\n\\nare located in the brain.\\n\\nThe serotonin 2A receptors are located\\n\\nin multiple brain regions,\\n\\nbut they have a tremendous amount of expression\\n\\nin the so-called neocortex, the outside of the brain\\n\\nthat includes things like our prefrontal cortex,\\n\\nwhich is involved in understanding context,\\n\\nwhich behaviors, thoughts, and speech patterns\\n\\nare appropriate for certain circumstances,\\n\\nhow to switch context and category switch\\n\\nwhen you go from playing sports to hanging out with friends\\n\\nto being in a professional setting,\\n\\nyou change your behavior in the way that you speak\\n\\nand perhaps even the way that you think.\\n\\nYou might think some things that are out of context,\\n\\nbut you probably keep those to yourself\\n\\nand your ability to keep those to yourself\\n\\nare dependent on a functional prefrontal cortex.\\n\\nThere are a lot of 5-HT2A,\\n\\nand by the way, 5-HT is the abbreviation for serotonin.\\n\\nSo there are a lot of serotonin 2A receptors\\n\\nin the prefrontal cortex.\\n\\nAlso in other areas of the cortex\\n\\nthat are associated with sensation and perception,\\n\\nthat is hearing of sounds,\\n\\nthat is seeing of particular things.\\n\\nAnd in particular, there is a very, very, very\\n\\nhigh expression of serotonin 2A receptors\\n\\nin the visual cortex.\\n\\nAnd that is one of the reasons\\n\\nwhy psilocybin triggers visual hallucinations.\\n\\nAnd provided psilocybin is present\\n\\nat sufficient enough concentration,\\n\\nthat is taken at a sufficient dosage,\\n\\none will experience profound visual hallucinations\\n\\nregardless of whether or not their eyes are open\\n\\nor their eyes are closed.\\n\\nNow that's an important fact\\n\\nbecause it explains one of the major effects of psilocybin\\n\\nthat people experience while they are on the drug.\\n\\nNow, as I'll talk about a little bit later\\n\\nin terms of what constitutes a useful psilocybin session,\\n\\nuseful meaning that it's leading\\n\\nto adaptive improvements in mood,\\n\\nadaptive improvements in creativity and cognition, et cetera,\\n\\nis that people not have their eyes open\\n\\nfor at least the majority of the psilocybin session.\\n\\nThis is something I've discussed with several experts\\n\\nwho are running clinical studies\\n\\non psilocybin in their laboratories,\\n\\nsome of whom are going to be guests\\n\\non the Huberman Lab podcast in upcoming episodes.\\n\\nAnd I can't underscore this enough.\\n\\nBecause your visual cortex contains so many\\n\\nof these serotonin 2A receptors,\\n\\nand because psilocybin binds so strongly\\n\\nto that serotonin 2A receptor,\\n\\nyou're going to experience a lot of visual hallucinations\\n\\nwhen you are under the influence of psilocybin.\\n\\nThere's no surprise there.\\n\\nThis has been known for hundreds, if not thousands of years.\\n\\nIt's one of the main reasons why people take psilocybin.\\n\\nHowever, as I mentioned earlier,\\n\\nthese hallucinations occur even when the eyes are closed.\\n\\nAnd it's now fairly well established\\n\\nthat if people are to take psilocybin\\n\\nand have their eyes open, much of their cognition,\\n\\nmuch of their thinking, much of the time spent\\n\\nin that psilocybin journey is focused\\n\\non the altered perceptions of things\\n\\nin the outside environment.\\n\\nSometimes this looks like a sort of a fracturing\\n\\nof the outside world into kind of geometric shapes.\\n\\nSometimes it appears as a kind of melting of things\\n\\nin the visual environment, including people's faces\\n\\nor a morphing of people's faces.\\n\\nAll of that has a strong, let's just call it a draw\\n\\nfor a lot of people who are looking\\n\\nfor a highly unusual experience\\n\\ninside of the psilocybin journey.\\n\\nBut I think if one's goal is to derive\\n\\nthe long lasting benefit from the psilocybin experience,\\n\\nit's very clear that having an eye mask\\n\\nor some other eye covering or something that ensures\\n\\nthat one's eyes are closed for the majority,\\n\\nif not the entire psilocybin session\\n\\nis going to be very useful\\n\\nbecause it's going to limit the extent\\n\\nto which one is focused on those outside changes\\n\\nin visual perception, aka hallucinations,\\n\\nand rather will allow the person to go inward\\n\\nto combine whatever it is that they happen to be seeing\\n\\nin their mind's eye with the different thoughts\\n\\nand memories and changes in their emotions\\n\\nthat are occurring.\\n\\nAnd that going inward by staying in the eye mask,\\n\\nat least for the majority of the time,\\n\\nseems to be a very, if not the critical feature\\n\\nof making the psilocybin journey effective\\n\\nin the therapeutic sense.\\n\\nNow, once again, I want to cue\\n\\nto some of the safety precautions here.\\n\\nI'm going to say this at least three times\\n\\nthroughout today's episode.\\n\\nAs I'm talking now and various other times\\n\\nthroughout today's episode,\\n\\nyou may get the impression\\n\\nthat I'm all for everybody doing psilocybin,\\n\\nand that is simply not the case.\\n\\nIn order for a psilocybin journey\\n\\nto be therapeutically useful,\\n\\nit does require certain conditions and supports,\\n\\nand there are certain people\\n\\nfor which psilocybin use is going to be contraindicated,\\n\\nmeaning they should not do psilocybin.\\n\\nIn particular, people who have existing\\n\\nor have a predisposition to psychotic episodes\\n\\nor bipolar episodes.\\n\\nEven having a first relative who has bipolar\\n\\nor schizophrenic or schizotypal issues\\n\\ncan be a rule-out condition\\n\\nthat can get someone eliminated\\n\\nfrom a clinical study on psilocybin\\n\\nfor fear of triggering psychotic episodes,\\n\\nnot just during the psilocybin journey,\\n\\nbut potentially in a longstanding way.\\n\\nSo again, that's really critical.\\n\\nThe other thing is that everything I'm talking about today,\\n\\nunless I say otherwise, is really focused on adults,\\n\\nmeaning people who are 25 years old or older,\\n\\nthat is their basic wiring and rewiring of the brain\\n\\nthat we call developmental neuroplasticity, is completed.\\n\\nMost of the studies today that I'll talk about\\n\\ninvolve subjects ranging from 25 years of age\\n\\nout to about 70 years of age,\\n\\nbut no one younger.\\n\\nSo again, psilocybin and its use\\n\\nis certainly not for everybody.\\n\\nIt's still illegal.\\n\\nIt's being used in the clinical setting and research setting.\\n\\nThere are these pockets of decriminalized areas\\n\\nand potentially soon legalization of psilocybin,\\n\\nbut again, only in the proper clinical setting.\\n\\nOkay, again, I say that not just to protect myself,\\n\\nbut I say that also to protect all of you.\\n\\nPsilocybin is a powerful, powerful drug,\\n\\nnot just to be under the influence of,\\n\\nbut also in terms of its longstanding changes\\n\\nafter the effects of psilocybin have worn off.\\n\\nI'd like to take a quick break\\n\\nand acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.\\n\\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1,\\n\\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\\n\\nthat covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.\\n\\nI've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,\\n\\nso I'm delighted that they're

the five free travel packs\\n\\nand the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.\\n\\nLet's talk a little bit about dosing of psilocybin\\n\\nand also about microdosing of psilocybin.\\n\\nNow, this is an area that I wouldn't say is controversial,\\n\\nbut that there's, how should we say this?\\n\\nThere's a lot of loose thinking around this\\n\\nin the non-clinical, non-research communities.\\n\\nBut within the clinical and research communities,\\n\\nthere's a lot of data that's come out\\n\\nindicating what effective and safe doses,\\n\\nprovided all other things are considered safe,\\n\\nsafe doses of psilocybin actually are.\\n\\nAnd here we really can go back to our discussion\\n\\nof psilocybin as quote unquote magic mushrooms or mushrooms.\\n\\nAnd if one were to translate\\n\\nfrom the mushroom form of psilocybin\\n\\nto the psilocybin that's actually used in various studies,\\n\\nbecause frankly, in these studies,\\n\\npeople aren't eating mushrooms.\\n\\nThey're typically taking synthetic psilocybin,\\n\\neither intravenously injected into a vein or orally.\\n\\nAnd that's how the researchers are able\\n\\nto tightly control the amount of psilocybin.\\n\\nAnd the typical dosage that's used in clinical studies\\n\\nranges from one milligram,\\n\\noften given repeatedly from day to day\\n\\nover long periods of time, so-called microdosing.\\n\\nAnd really that one milligram per day\\n\\nor even up to three milligrams per day,\\n\\nrepeatedly over time is what people generally think of\\n\\nas microdosing as compared to say a 10 milligram dose\\n\\ngiven once, maybe twice in two separate sessions,\\n\\nor a 25 to 30 milligram dosage that's given once\\n\\nor twice.\\n\\nNow, those amounts of one to three milligrams\\n\\nor 10 milligrams or 25 to 30 milligrams\\n\\nmight not mean much to those of you\\n\\nthat don't think about these things in the research terms.\\n\\nPerhaps you've heard of microdosing\\n\\nand you've also heard of macro\\n\\nor quote unquote heroic dosing, okay?\\n\\nThat's sort of a common,\\n\\nor I should say popular nomenclature for psychedelics.\\n\\nAnd I'll circle back to that in a few minutes.\\n\\nBut I think one of the questions that I hear a lot\\n\\nis how much psilocybin is present\\n\\nin a given amount of mushrooms.\\n\\nAnd so the way this typically works\\n\\nis that mushrooms are often discussed\\n\\nin terms of grams or ounces.\\n\\nSo an eighth of mushrooms\\n\\nrefers to an eighth of an ounce of mushrooms\\n\\nor X number of grams of mushrooms.\\n\\nThe breakdown is actually quite simple.\\n\\n1000 milligrams equals one gram.\\n\\nAnd the concentration of psilocybin\\n\\nin most so-called magic mushrooms\\n\\nis about 1%.\\n\\nSo one gram of mushrooms being 1000 milligrams\\n\\nmeans that it contains approximately,\\n\\nand again, it's approximately 10 milligrams of psilocybin.\\n\\nAnd then most of the clinical studies,\\n\\nit's been shown that the dosage of 25 to 30 milligrams\\n\\ngiven, or I should say taken once or twice,\\n\\nwe'll talk about the spacing of sessions a little bit later,\\n\\ntaken once or twice is what's leading\\n\\nto the most pronounced therapeutic outcomes.\\n\\nBut of course, with enhanced therapeutic outcomes,\\n\\none also observes enhanced side effect profiles\\n\\nor what are called adverse events.\\n\\nSo there's an important nuanced conversation\\n\\nthat has to take place.\\n\\nBut right now we're talking about the conversion\\n\\nof grams of mushrooms to psilocybin.\\n\\nSo one gram of mushrooms being 1000 milligrams\\n\\ncontaining 1% psilocybin means that it contains\\n\\n10 milligrams of psilocybin.\\n\\nNow, the so-called heroic doses that you've heard about,\\n\\nand this is something that's discussed more with the,\\n\\nlet's call them traditional or classic psychonauts.\\n\\nThese are people that may have an advanced degree,\\n\\nbut typically are not running laboratories\\n\\nexploring the effects of psilocybin\\n\\nin controlled clinical trials.\\n\\nThese are people who have been longtime explorers\\n\\nand often writers and people who have been spokespeople\\n\\nfor psilocybin and other psychedelics.\\n\\nAnd they will often refer to the so-called heroic doses.\\n\\nIt's a little bit hard to translate\\n\\nfrom that informal community to the scientific data.\\n\\nBut in discussing that topic with various researchers\\n\\nwho run laboratories at major universities\\n\\nfocused on psychedelic therapies,\\n\\nwhat I was told is that the quote unquote heroic dose\\n\\nthat's often discussed really refers to a five gram\\n\\nor so dose of mushrooms.\\n\\nSo what that translates to is 50 milligrams of psilocybin.\\n\\nSo when you hear someone talk\\n\\nabout a quote unquote heroic dose,\\n\\nthey're probably referring to ingestion\\n\\nof 50 milligrams or so of psilocybin,\\n\\nbut in its mushroom form.\\n\\nSo about five grams of mushrooms.\\n\\nAnd again, it's important to point out\\n\\nthat the concentration of psilocybin\\n\\nin different strains of mushrooms and in different batches,\\n\\nand depending on the age of those mushrooms\\n\\nand how they've been stored, et cetera,\\n\\ncan vary tremendously from batch to batch.\\n\\nIn fact, there are some laboratories\\n\\nthat have explored the range of psilocybin concentration\\n\\nin different mushroom strains\\n\\nand different so-called magic mushrooms.\\n\\nAnd that range is pretty broad.\\n\\nIt's anywhere from a half percent all the way up to 2%.\\n\\nWhat that means is that someone might get a hold\\n\\nof one gram of mushrooms thinking\\n\\nthat they're taking 10 milligrams of psilocybin\\n\\nin those mushrooms when in fact they're actually taking 20.\\n\\nOr somebody could take three grams of mushrooms\\n\\nthinking they're taking 30 grams of psilocybin.\\n\\nAnd in fact, they're only taking 10\\n\\nor 15 milligrams of psilocybin.\\n\\nSo the sourcing is really key, obviously,\\n\\nas things become more legal and more regulated\\n\\nand more used in the therapeutic setting.\\n\\nOr, and this is what's happening more and more,\\n\\nor as people start to rely on synthetically made psilocybin\\n\\nas opposed to using mushrooms to ingest psilocybin,\\n\\nthen certainly the dosaging is going to be more consistent\\n\\nfrom batch to batch\\n\\nbecause we're not talking about batches of mushrooms,\\n\\nwe're talking about batches of psilocybin itself.\\n\\nSo now I'd like to take a step back\\n\\nfrom all this chemistry and cell biology\\n\\nand talk a little bit about the structure\\n\\nof a psilocybin journey itself\\n\\nand relate that to what we now know\\n\\nabout what's happening in the brain\\n\\nduring the psilocybin journey.\\n\\nAnd then a little bit later,\\n\\nwe will return to that serotonin 2A receptor\\n\\nwhen we talk about some of the more lasting changes\\n\\nin brain chemistry and brain wiring\\n\\nthat occur after the psilocybin journey is over.\\n\\nSo let's take a couple of minutes\\n\\nand just discuss the various components\\n\\nof an effective therapeutic psilocybin journey.\\n\\nAnd here I'm not detailing a menu of things\\n\\nthat people should do in order to pretend\\n\\nthat they are a psilocybin assisted therapy coach\\n\\nor to do self-administered psilocybin therapy.\\n\\nThat is not what I'm doing.\\n\\nWhat I am trying to do is to share with you\\n\\nthe consistent components that are present\\n\\nin the clinical trials that have demonstrated\\n\\nthe effectiveness of psilocybin\\n\\nfor the treatment of depression\\n\\nand for other compulsive and addictive disorders.\\n\\nAnd those data, meaning the specific data\\n\\nrelated to those trials and the references themselves,\\n\\nwe'll get into a little bit later.\\n\\nBut we can't really have a conversation about psilocybin\\n\\nand what it does without talking about\\n\\nthe so-called set and setting as it's often referred to\\n\\nthat is known to at least bias the probability\\n\\nof the journey being beneficial\\n\\nand not a so-called bad trip.\\n\\nSo what are the variables that make up\\n\\nan effective and safe psilocybin journey?\\n\\nAnd again, when we say safe,\\n\\nwe're referring to people who are not prone\\n\\nto psychotic episodes.\\n\\nThey don't even have a first relative\\n\\nthat's prone to psychotic episodes.\\n\\nWe're talking about people that are 25 years or older.\\n\\nWe're talking about people that, for instance,\\n\\nare not taking antidepressants\\n\\nthat impact the serotonin system.\\n\\nThis is very important to understand.\\n\\nI think a lot of people don't know this,\\n\\nbut as far as I know, all of the studies\\n\\nthat have explored psilocybin for its ability\\n\\nto positively impact brain chemistry and mood and function\\n\\nhave required that people either not be on\\n\\nor abstain from antidepressants in the weeks\\n\\nleading up to the psilocybin journey.\\n\\nNow, that is not to say that\\n\\nif you are currently taking SSRIs or something similar\\n\\nthat you should cease taking them and do psilocybin.\\n\\nI'm absolutely not saying that.\\n\\nThat could be very, very, very dangerous\\n\\nif not catastrophic.\\n\\nAnytime you're going to take anything\\n\\nor stop taking anything for that matter,\\n\\nyou do need to consult with your physician.\\n\\nLet's get a psychiatrist as well.\\n\\nSo let's talk about psilocybin journeys\\n\\nfrom the subjective side and from the structural side.\\n\\nAnd when I say the structural side,\\n\\nwhat I mean is what does a psychedelic journey\\n\\nactually include?\\n\\nAnd here are the words set and setting\\n\\nbecome extremely important.\\n\\nSome of you may have heard that set and setting\\n\\nare the foundation of a well-done\\n\\nor even therapeutically beneficial psychedelic journey.\\n\\nAnd all of that really hinges on safety and outcomes.\\n\\nSo set refers to mindset,\\n\\nthe mindset of the person taking the psychedelic.\\n\\nAnd setting refers to, as the name suggests,\\n\\nthe setting in which they're taking it in\\n\\nand the people that are present there.\\n\\nSo let's talk about setting first.\\n\\nThe setting for a psychedelic journey\\n\\nneeds to be one in which the person\\n\\nunder the influence of the psilocybin\\n\\nor other psychedelic is safe.\\n\\nThat means no windows they can jump out of.\\n\\nThat means no streets of moving cars they can run out into.\\n\\nThat means no opportunity for getting lost.\\n\\nThat means no opportunity for getting into bodies of water.\\n\\nIn other words, it requires that there be at least one\\n\\nand perhaps even two or more other individuals\\n\\nwho are not also taking psychedelics, right?\\n\\nWho are not also taking psychedelics\\n\\npresent in that setting to ensure\\n\\nthat the person taking the psilocybin\\n\\nis not going to harm themselves or others.\\n\\nI say this not to sound like a school teacher,\\n\\neven though technically I'm a school teacher,\\n\\nbut because of course I don't want anyone to get harmed.\\n\\nAnd I'm also aware that there's a lot of interest nowadays\\n\\nin psychedelics such as psilocybin becoming legal\\n\\nor decriminalized for their therapeutic applications.\\n\\nAnd if we look back to the late 1960s and early 1970s,\\n\\nwhen the Controlled Substances Act was invoked\\n\\nto make psychedelics like psilocybin illegal,\\n\\none of the bases for that was not just the geopolitical\\n\\nunrest at the time and things like the Vietnam War,\\n\\nbut also some highlighted instances in which people\\n\\ndid not take set and setting into consideration,\\n\\ntook things like LSD, stared at the sun, went blind\\n\\nor took psilocybin, went out and harmed somebody else.\\n\\nAgain, these are very, very isolated instances,\\n\\nbut these are the exact sort of instances\\n\\nthat lead to criminalization or the fact\\n\\nthat things like psilocybin and LSD and MDMA\\n\\nfor that matter are considered illegal.\\n\\nAgain, I completely acknowledge\\n\\nthat there are a number of different factors\\n\\nmaking them illegal.\\n\\nWe could have a whole discussion about that.\\n\\nWe talk about the drug trade, the war on drugs,\\n\\nbut right now is such a critical time in the history\\n\\nand the use of psychedelics for therapeutic\\n\\nand other reasons and getting setting correct,\\n\\nmeaning making it absolutely as safe as possible\\n\\nfor the person taking the psychedelic is absolutely key.\\n\\nAnd one of the best ways to ensure that it's safe\\n\\nis to have responsible individuals who are not\\n\\nunder the influence of psychedelics\\n\\npresent in that environment.\\n\\nSo that's one component of setting.\\n\\nThe other component of setting that we talked about earlier,\\n\\nwhich turns out to be very important,\\n\\nis the opportunity and perhaps even the bias\\n\\ntoward the person on the psychedelic being seated\\n\\nor ideally lying down and being in the eye mask\\n\\nor at least having their eyes covered\\n\\nso that they can combine any spontaneous\\n\\nvisual hallucinations that occur\\n\\nwith the various thought processes that are occurring\\n\\nwhile under the influence of psychedelics.\\n\\nThis is far and away different than quote unquote,\\n\\ntaking mushrooms and going into the woods\\n\\nor taking mushrooms and going to the beach.\\n\\nWhat we're talking about today is\\n\\nthe use of psychedelics for particular brain rewiring\\n\\noutcomes that yes, can involve things\\n\\nlike changing one's relationship to nature\\n\\nor changing one's relationship to somebody else\\n\\nby interacting with nature or somebody else.\\n\\nAnd while I'm not trying to diminish the potential value\\n\\nof those sorts of psychedelic journeys,\\n\\nif we look at the scientific data,\\n\\nthe vast majority of it, not just in the clinical setting,\\n\\nbut in terms of understanding the safety and efficacy\\n\\nand positive rewiring of brain circuitry\\n\\nthat allows people to feel better,\\n\\nto understand themselves better\\n\\nand to interact with life in more adaptive ways\\n\\ngoing forward out of the psychedelic journey\\n\\ninvolve these very, let's say, subdued settings\\n\\nthat are typically in one room, a closed environment\\n\\nwith one or two other individuals acting as sort of guides\\n\\nor helping the individual by talking to them\\n\\nfrom time to time if they feel like they have to sort\\n\\nthrough a particular aspect of the psychedelic journey\\n\\nthat's creating anxiety.\\n\\nAnd we'll talk about the contour of the psychedelic journey\\n\\nthat almost everyone who takes psilocybin\\n\\nat somewhere between 20 and 30 milligram dosages\\n\\ntends to experience.\\n\\nBut the setting that I'm describing\\n\\nis not just a list of things to make sure you're safe,\\n\\nbut they're really the list of things that also ensure\\n\\nthat one can get the maximum benefit\\n\\nout of the psilocybin journey.\\n\\nNow, other things included in setting that are known,\\n\\nagain, from scientific literature to be very influential\\n\\nin terms of the experience that one has\\n\\nand to bias things towards a positive experience\\n\\nare, again, safety, eye mask,\\n\\nbut also the presence of music.\\n\\nNow, when I first heard about this\\n\\nfrom one of the premier researchers on psilocybin\\n\\nand other psychedelics, which is Robin Cardart Harris,\\n\\nhe's a professor at University of California, San Francisco,\\n\\nwho's one of the major pioneers\\n\\nin the studies of psychedelics.\\n\\nAnd when he first started telling me about the critical role\\n\\nthat music plays, I thought, okay, that makes sense.\\n\\nThat music can impact our emotion,\\n\\nimpact the way that we think,\\n\\nand could therefore impact what one experiences\\n\\nduring the psychedelic journey.\\n\\nBut he really underscored for me the extent\\n\\nto which music is not just a sort of incidental feature\\n\\nof the setting in psychedelic set and setting,\\n\\nbut that it is one of the major drivers\\n\\nof the actual cognitive and emotional experience\\n\\nthat somebody has on something like psilocybin\\n\\nthat allows the psilocybin journey\\n\\nto be looked at or viewed, not just as beneficial,\\n\\nbut, and this is quoted in the scientific literature,\\n\\nas one of the most profound and important\\n\\npositive experiences that one ever experienced in their life.\\n\\nSo let's talk about the sorts of music\\n\\nthat have been used in these clinical studies.\\n\\nWell, first of all, we need to think about\\n\\nhow long the psilocybin journey itself is going to be.\\n\\nAnd the typical duration of the psilocybin journey\\n\\nis anywhere from four to six hours.\\n\\nIt's going to depend somewhat on dose.\\n\\nIt's going to depend somewhat on variability\\n\\nin people's liver metabolism.\\n\\nAnd it's also going to depend somewhat\\n\\non how much food people have in their gut.\\n\\nIn all the clinical studies that I read,\\n\\nit was advised that people not have any food in their gut\\n\\nat the time at which they ingest\\n\\nor injected with the psilocybin.\\n\\nIt's particularly true if people are going to be taking\\n\\npsilocybin mushrooms in order to get their psilocybin.\\n\\nAnd that has been done in a few studies.\\n\\nMost studies, however, use synthetic psilocybin\\n\\ntaken orally.\\n\\nAgain, that's converted to psilocin in the gut\\n\\nby the acidity of the gut.\\n\\nAnd the acidity of the gut is going to be impacted\\n\\nby the various foods that people eat.\\n\\nAnd so that's one of the major reasons\\n\\nwhy people are advised to not eat\\n\\nfor at least four hours prior to the psilocybin journey.\\n\\nSo here we've got this six hour,\\n\\nwhat we're calling journey,\\n\\nbecause that's what everyone calls it or trip,\\n\\nthat people start experiencing about 30 to 45 minutes\\n\\nafter ingesting psilocybin or taking psilocybin.\\n\\nThere's a peak component in which\\n\\nthere's a maximal intensity of emotion\\n\\nand often that's also associated with anxiety.\\n\\nAnd this is very important to understand.\\n\\nThe anxiety component is part of what\\n\\nin the therapeutic setting they refer to as ego dissolution\\n\\nand that anxiety around the peak.\\n\\nAnd I think most people would probably hear\\n\\npeak experience and think,\\n\\noh, we're talking about a peak positive experience.\\n\\nBut no, we're referring to a peak experience and anxiety\\n\\nthat people stay with and then come down from gradually\\n\\nas one goes from the second or third hour\\n\\nafter taking psilocybin.\\n\\nAnd that tapers off slowly toward the six hour mark,\\n\\nwhat sometimes people refer to as parachuting back in.\\n\\nOf course, they're not, hopefully,\\n\\nI would very much hope people aren't actually parachuting\\n\\nback in while on psilocybin, but I think you get the idea.\\n\\nThe music that's typically played in the clinical studies\\n\\nusing psilocybin for the treatment of depression\\n\\nor for compulsive disorders or addiction\\n\\ntends to have a particular contour that matches with\\n\\nand can also drive that contour of the psilocybin journey\\n\\nthat I just described.\\n\\nAgain, we're talking about people wearing an eye mask\\n\\nwith guides present.\\n\\nSo people who are not taking psilocybin there as well\\n\\nto ensure that the person feels supported and is safe.\\n\\nThe person is typically lying down, sometimes sitting down,\\n\\nbut more often than not lying down wearing an eye mask.\\n\\nAnd the music that's played at the beginning\\n\\nof the psilocybin session tends to be music\\n\\nthat doesn't have a lot of vocalizations.\\n\\nIt tends to be things like classical music.\\n\\nIt tends to be fairly low volume,\\n\\nbut that then transitions into music\\n\\nthat has a lot of percussion.\\n\\nSo often drums that tends to be higher volume\\n\\nthat has a lot of intensity at about the time\\n\\nthat one would be experiencing the peak in emotion\\n\\nand in perception, the so-called peak of the journey.\\n\\nThat intense music tends to be played\\n\\nfor about 45 minutes to 90 minutes,\\n\\ndepending on the study one looks at.\\n\\nAnd then tends to transition into softer music again,\\n\\nsometimes choral type or more melodic music,\\n\\noften female voices in particular,\\n\\nand then transition into nature sounds and things\\n\\nthat more or less mimic the outside natural world\\n\\nand less so synthetic things like drums or instruments\\n\\nand vocalizations and things of that sort.\\n\\nSo why would it be so important that music match\\n\\nand even contribute to the subjective experience\\n\\nthat people have on psychedelics?\\n\\nAnd here we should probably take a couple of moments\\n\\nand just talk about what those subjective experiences\\n\\nare like.\\n\\nSo for people that haven't done psilocybin\\n\\nor any psychedelics, it's a little hard to describe,\\n\\nbut one way to describe it is that there's a lot\\n\\nof so-called perceptual blending.\\n\\nSo for instance, people in the eye mask will report\\n\\nseeing some geometric shapes and colors,\\n\\nbut perhaps the music they're listening to\\n\\nwill then start to change the intensity\\n\\nor the movement of whatever it is that they're seeing,\\n\\nhallucinating inside of the eye mask\\n\\nin ways that are linked.\\n\\nThis is referred to as synesthesia\\n\\nor the merging of different senses\\n\\nthat are not ordinarily merged.\\n\\nIn addition, people under the influence of psilocybin\\n\\nor other psychedelics for that matter,\\n\\noften will report that their pattern of breathing\\n\\nbecomes linked to the perceptions of things\\n\\nthat they are hearing or seeing or feeling.\\n\\nSo for instance, if they take a big deep breath in\\n\\nand then a long exhale out,\\n\\nthey may find that during the long exhale out\\n\\nthat the notes of music that they're hearing\\n\\nin those moments are also drawn out\\n\\nfor the duration of the breath and they'll inhale\\n\\nand that they're getting at least what they perceive\\n\\nas control over the music,\\n\\nwhich of course they are not actually controlling\\n\\nby using their breath.\\n\\nAnd that perhaps their visual perceptions\\n\\nare also being merged with that.\\n\\nSo those are just a couple of examples\\n\\nof how perceptual blending AKA synesthesia can occur\\n\\nwhile under the influence of psilocybin.\\n\\nAnd this really is highly individual\\n\\nfrom one person to the next.\\n\\nSome people, for instance, will find\\n\\nthat if they take their fingertips\\n\\nand rub them across the couch or the chair\\n\\nthat they happen to be lying down or sitting on,\\n\\nthat they will experience a change in the music.\\n\\nMaybe even if they move their hand up,\\n\\nthey hear an increase in frequency of sound,\\n\\nthey move their hand down,\\n\\nthey hear a decrease in frequency of sound\\n\\nand that all of this is linked to their emotional state\\n\\nat the same time and vice versa.\\n\\nOkay, so we're talking about a lot of perceptual\\n\\nand emotional blending and some sense of control\\n\\nover one's perceptions and emotions\\n\\nin a way that's very unordinary, even extraordinary.\\n\\nNow we can step back from all of this\\n\\nvery subjective description of the psychedelic journey\\n\\nand ask what is going on\\n\\nthat would allow these sorts of things to occur?\\n\\nAnd there you are already equipped\\n\\nwith an understanding of the cell biology\\n\\nand the chemistry that makes all of this possible.\\n\\nAnd that is that when psilocybin is ingested\\n\\nand then converted to psilocin,\\n\\nit's the psilocin that crosses the blood-brain barrier.\\n\\nAnd then even though psilocin looks a lot like serotonin,\\n\\npsilocin has this incredible ability\\n\\nto predominantly activate the serotonin 2A receptor.\\n\\nWell, we can understand much of what's happening\\n\\nat a subjective level during the psychedelic journey,\\n\\neven right down to the sorts of emotions\\n\\nand perceptual blending, the synesthesia.\\n\\nWe can understand a lot of that\\n\\nby understanding where the serotonin 2A receptors\\n\\nare expressed on neurons\\n\\nand what those particular neurons are doing.\\n\\nAnd the simplest way to describe this\\n\\nis that there's a category of neurons\\n\\nthat we call pyramidal neurons.\\n\\nPyramidal neurons are found lots of places in the brain,\\n\\nbut they're called pyramidal neurons\\n\\nbecause they're shaped like a pyramid.\\n\\nThey have a cell body,\\n\\nwhich is the part of the cell that has the DNA in it\\n\\nand a lot of other important things\\n\\nlike the organelles, mitochondria, et cetera.\\n\\nAnd then they also have what are called dendrites.\\n\\nDendrites are the little branches or processes\\n\\nthat reach out both from the bottom of these cells.\\n\\nAnd then these pyramidal cells are interesting\\n\\nbecause they also grow a branch up, up, up, up, up\\n\\ninto layers of neural tissue above them.\\n\\nAnd they have what's called an apical branch.\\n\\nThat's the part that grows up.\\n\\nAnd then they fan out at the top.\\n\\nAnd that fanning out at the top allows them to communicate\\n\\nwith other neurons in their environment.\\n\\nOkay, so if you're not getting a good picture of this\\n\\nin your mind from my description, I apologize,\\n\\nbut simply think about putting your arms out to the side.\\n\\nAnd by doing that, you're able to interact with things\\n\\nthat are some distance from your body.\\n\\nSort of an obvious thing in that case.\\n\\nThese cells are effectively doing the same thing\\n\\nby extending little processes out into layers above them\\n\\nand to the sides.\\n\\nAnd this is really important\\n\\nbecause much of the serotonin 2A receptors\\n\\nthat are present on neurons in the brain\\n\\nare present in those apical dendrites,\\n\\nthose branches of these pyramidal neurons\\n\\nthat are above and that extend out\\n\\nto the side of those neurons.\\n\\nAnd so when somebody is under the influence of psilocybin,\\n\\nthat means that psilocin has bound to the receptors\\n\\non those apical dendrites,\\n\\nand it's increasing lateral communication\\n\\nacross brain areas.\\n\\nIn fact, this is perhaps one of the most well-documented\\n\\neffects of psilocybin and other psychedelics,\\n\\nwhich is that there's a shift\\n\\nfrom the brain being more modular,\\n\\nmeaning more segmented,\\n\\nlike auditory neurons are communicating electrically\\n\\nand chemically largely with other auditory neurons.\\n\\nOf course, they'll communicate\\n\\nwith other types of neurons too, right?\\n\\nWhen I hear something off to my right,\\n\\nlike a snap of the fingers off the right,\\n\\nI'll turn my head and my ability to do that\\n\\ndepends on my auditory neurons being linked up\\n\\nwith things like my motor system and my visual system.\\n\\nBut the key thing to understand is that\\n\\nwhen there is psilocybin present in one system,\\n\\nthat the communication of any of these pyramidal neurons,\\n\\nthe ones involved in hearing,\\n\\nthe ones involved in thinking,\\n\\nthe ones involved in memory,\\n\\nthe ones involved in visual perception\\n\\nor in the generation of visual hallucinations\\n\\nwith eyes closed,\\n\\nthose are all talking to many, many more other neurons\\n\\nmore extensively.\\n\\nSo what happens effectively is that\\n\\nthere's a reduction in the modularity,\\n\\nthe separateness of function in the brain,\\n\\nand an increase in what's called integration\\n\\nof communication across\\n\\nwhat would otherwise be disparate brain regions.\\n\\nWe can say that really simply by saying psilocybin\\n\\nincreases communication across the brain.\\n\\nNow, in addition to that, there's a reduction\\n\\nin what's called the hierarchical organization of the brain.\\n\\nTypically, sensory information comes in\\n\\nfrom the outside environment.\\n\\nSo we hear something, we see something,\\n\\nwe taste something, we smell something.\\n\\nAnd in what's called a bottom up fashion,\\n\\nmeaning bottom from the periphery,\\n\\nup meaning it propagates up through the eyes,\\n\\nthrough the nose, through the ears, through the skin\\n\\nor the senses in those regions, I should say,\\n\\nup into areas of the brain that sit deep to the cortex\\n\\nlike the thalamus.\\n\\nAnd then the thalamus is sort of a way station.\\n\\nIt's like a switchboard that sends visual stuff\\n\\nto the visual centers and auditory stuff\\n\\nto the auditory centers\\n\\nand touch stuff to the touch centers\\n\\nand things that maybe trigger a memory\\n\\noff to the memory centers of the brain, et cetera.\\n\\nThat's the typical organization.\\n\\nIt's hierarchical because it goes from the periphery\\n\\nup to the more complex processing regions of the brain\\n\\nthat make decisions, that link all of that stuff\\n\\nto prior experience, maybe plans about the future.\\n\\nWhen psilocybin is present in the system,\\n\\nthere's a broadening of the flow of that information\\n\\nfrom the bottom up as well.\\n\\nAnd that has to do with what's called thalamic gating.\\n\\nThe thalamus is a very interesting structure.\\n\\nWe probably don't want to go into it\\n\\nin too much detail right now,\\n\\nbut it really is like a switchboard and a way station\\n\\nsaying, hey, pay attention to the visual stuff.\\n\\nPay attention to the auditory stuff\\n\\nor just to the visual and auditory stuff\\n\\nand ignore touch sensation for the time being\\n\\nor vice versa.\\n\\nWhen psilocybin is present in the system\\n\\nand when serotonin 2A receptors are activated very strongly,\\n\\nthere's a tremendous broadening of the flow of information\\n\\nup and through the thalamus.\\n\\nSo not only is there more communication\\n\\nof so-called higher order brain centers,\\n\\nwe refer to them as higher order\\n\\nbecause they're involved in thinking and decision making\\n\\nand emotion, et cetera,\\n\\nbut there's also a shift in the flow of sensory information\\n\\ninto the brain that can generally be described as broader\\n\\nand including more blending of the different senses.\\n\\nAnd when I say blending of the senses,\\n\\nI'm also referring to blending of the sense\\n\\nof interoception, of our sense of our body\\n\\nand what's happening inside of our body.\\n\\nAnd this without question, at least partially explains\\n\\nwhy when under the influence of psilocybin,\\n\\none's breathing can be linked to a sound\\n\\nand then suddenly the sound one thinks\\n\\nis being controlled by one's breathing\\n\\nor that the sound itself can be linked to something\\n\\nthat we see in our mind's eye while in the eye mask.\\n\\nEssentially what I'm describing here\\n\\nis that serotonin 2A receptor activation\\n\\nallows for more broad, less precise\\n\\nand less hierarchical activation of brain circuitry.\\n\\nAnd when I say hierarchical,\\n\\nwhat I mean is that normally things go from periphery,\\n\\nfrom eyes to thalamus to visual cortex.\\n\\nHowever, when under the influence of psilocybin,\\n\\nas I mentioned before, even in the eye mask,\\n\\nthe visual cortex is going to be very activated\\n\\neven in the absence of any visual input.\\n\\nSo then if one hears a sound, perhaps from music,\\n\\na particular motif or voice,\\n\\nand that's linked to a particular emotional state,\\n\\nthat is now being blended with visual phenomenon\\n\\noccurring within the brain that have no external stimulus.\\n\\nAnd so while the patterns of activation in the brain\\n\\nwhile under the influence of psilocybin aren't random,\\n\\nthey are far less channeled, far less modular\\n\\nand far less hierarchical than would ever be the case\\n\\nwhen not under the influence of psilocybin.\\n\\nI'd like to just take a brief break\\n\\nand thank one of our sponsors, which is Element.\\n\\nElement is an electrolyte drink\\n\\nthat has everything you need and nothing you don't.\\n\\nThat means plenty of salt, sodium, magnesium and potassium,\\n\\nthe so-called electrolytes and no sugar.\\n\\nNow, salt, magnesium and potassium are critical\\n\\nto the function of all the cells in your body,\\n\\nin particular to the function of your nerve cells,\\n\\nalso called neurons.\\n\\nAnd we now know that even slight reductions\\n\\nin electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body\\n\\ncan lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.\\n\\nElement contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio\\n\\nof 1,000 milligrams, that's one gram of sodium,\\n\\n200 milligrams of potassium and 60 milligrams of magnesium.\\n\\nI typically drink Element first thing in the morning\\n\\nwhen I wake up in order to hydrate my body\\n\\nand make sure I have enough electrolytes.\\n\\nAnd while I do any kind of physical training\\n\\nand after physical training as well,\\n\\nespecially if I've been sweating a lot,\\n\\nand certainly I drink Element in my water\\n\\nwhen I'm in the sauna and after going in the sauna\\n\\nbecause that causes quite a lot of sweating.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,\\n\\nthat's lmnt.com slash Huberman\\n\\nto claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.\\n\\nAgain, that's drinkelementlmnt.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nNow, in all fairness to the scientific literature,\\n\\nthere are not one, not two, not three,\\n\\nbut four prominent theories of which brain networks\\n\\nare most activated during a psilocybin\\n\\nor other psychedelic journey.\\n\\nAnd so for those of you\\n\\nthat are interested in those different models,\\n\\nfirst of all, please know that they are not competing models.\\n\\nWhile some of them disagree about some of the details,\\n\\nit's very likely that all of these models are true.\\n\\nThey include things like changes\\n\\nin the so-called default mode network.\\n\\nThere's a lot of interest in this.\\n\\nI've talked about it before on this podcast.\\n\\nThe default mode network is the network in the brain\\n\\nthat's thought to be responsible\\n\\nfor spontaneous imagination, for daydreaming,\\n\\nand that reflects sort of the base activation state\\n\\nof the brain when there's no drugs in our system.\\n\\nAnd the default mode network is one of the systems\\n\\nor networks rather, that is thought to be rewired\\n\\nunder conditions of psilocybin or other psychedelics.\\n\\nAgain, if you're interested in these models\\n\\nand comparing and contrasting them,\\n\\nthere's a very nice review from Brian Roth's lab at Duke\\n\\nentitled The Neural Basis of Psychedelic Action.\\n\\nWe'll provide a link to this in the show note captions.\\n\\nAnd again, I just want to emphasize\\n\\nthat all of these models have been shown to be true\\n\\nin different studies.\\n\\nAnd what they all point to is more extensive communication\\n\\nbetween areas of the brain that normally\\n\\nare not as active at the same time\\n\\nwhile under the influence of psychedelics\\n\\nsuch as psilocybin.\\n\\nThe controversy in the field relates\\n\\nto which of these networks is the one\\n\\nthat changes the most to explain the therapeutic outcomes\\n\\nthat have been discovered in recent years.\\n\\nSo again, check out that review\\n\\nif you're interested in that sort of thing.\\n\\nIn the meantime, we can cut a broad swath\\n\\nthrough all of those models\\n\\nand just say that psilocybin expands\\n\\nthe functional connectivity of the brain\\n\\nwhile one is under the influence of psilocybin.\\n\\nAnd it does seem that some of that expanded\\n\\nfunctional connectivity persists\\n\\nafter the effects of psilocybin have worn off.\\n\\nAnd that statement about the functional connectivity\\n\\nof the brain being more expanded,\\n\\nnot just during the psilocybin session, but after as well,\\n\\nhas been substantiated in a number of papers.\\n\\nBut one of the key papers in this area\\n\\nis one that I recommend people check out\\n\\nif they're interested in this sort of thing,\\n\\nis entitled the effects of psilocybin and MDMA\\n\\non between network resting state functional connectivity\\n\\nin healthy volunteers.\\n\\nAnd I like this paper for a number of reasons.\\n\\nFirst of all, it's a very high quality paper carried out\\n\\nin the laboratory of Robin Cardart Harris at UCSF.\\n\\nAgain, one of the premier researchers\\n\\nin this area of psychedelics and their function,\\n\\nwhat they do in the brain\\n\\nand also their therapeutic applications,\\n\\nbut also because it focused on healthy volunteers.\\n\\nThey explored using brain imaging,\\n\\nwhat brain areas are active in a resting state.\\n\\nSo things like default mode network.\\n\\nThen they had people take psilocybin or MDMA.\\n\\nAnd then they looked at the connectivity\\n\\nbetween those brain areas in those same individuals\\n\\nwhen they were not under the influence of these drugs\\n\\nand found more extensive connectivity.\\n\\nAll of which pointed to an enhanced lateral connectivity,\\n\\nless hierarchical organization,\\n\\neffectively more interconnection and communication\\n\\nbetween different brain areas.\\n\\nI think not only is the fact\\n\\nthat they looked at healthy volunteers,\\n\\nvery interesting and important,\\n\\nbut also that they looked at this resting state of the brain.\\n\\nThey weren't providing a particular auditory\\n\\nor visual stimulus for people to hear or look at\\n\\nwhile they were in the brain imaging scanner,\\n\\nas it's called.\\n\\nRather, they were simply looking at\\n\\nhow the brain was behaving at rest.\\n\\nAnd so it's very clear that for people that do two\\n\\nor even just one of these psilocybin journeys\\n\\nat a particular dose,\\n\\nthat the brain is actually getting rewired.\\n\\nYou know, we hear this a lot.\\n\\nPsilocybin or other psychedelics lead to plasticity.\\n\\nThey rewire your brain.\\n\\nWell, let's go back to what we said at the beginning.\\n\\nRewiring of the brain is not the goal.\\n\\nAdaptive rewiring of the brain is the goal, right?\\n\\nRewiring that leads to new ideas that are interesting,\\n\\nthat are accessible after the psychedelic journey,\\n\\nnew ideas and new ways of thinking or feeling\\n\\nthat allow people to function better in their lives.\\n\\nThat's the goal of effective psychedelic therapies,\\n\\nnot simply rewiring of the brain.\\n\\nA brain injury for that matter\\n\\nwill lead to rewiring of the brain,\\n\\nbut that's maladaptive rewiring.\\n\\nThe use of things like amphetamines or methamphetamines\\n\\nin particular will lead to rewiring of the brain,\\n\\nbut that is strongly maladaptive rewiring.\\n\\nSo now there are really dozens of studies\\n\\nconducted in humans using brain imaging\\n\\nand other techniques have evaluated\\n\\nhow things like psilocybin change connectivity in the brain.\\n\\nAnd I think the take-home message is\\n\\nit expands that connectivity.\\n\\nHowever, it seems to do so in ways\\n\\nthat still allow people to function in their daily lives.\\n\\nAnd one of the key things that I gleaned from the literature\\n\\non the therapeutic use of psilocybin\\n\\nfor the treatment of depression\\n\\nis that very seldom do people who take psilocybin\\n\\nexperience long-term issues with memory.\\n\\nWhy is that so critical?\\n\\nWell, you could imagine that increasing connectivity\\n\\nin the brain, reducing modularity,\\n\\nreducing hierarchical organization of the brain\\n\\nwould lead to disruptions in memory, right?\\n\\nIt's as if you're shuffling books on the bookshelf,\\n\\nso to speak, but that doesn't seem to be the case.\\n\\nRather, it seems that the increase in connectivity\\n\\nis leading, provided set and setting are correct,\\n\\nprovided safety protocols are followed\\n\\nto positive rewiring or adaptive rewiring of neural tissue.\\n\\nSo that's one of the things that makes psychedelics\\n\\nand psilocybin in particular very exciting\\n\\nfrom the therapeutic standpoint.\\n\\nAnd of course, we have to acknowledge\\n\\nthat it's also what has a lot of people excited\\n\\nabout psychedelics, not just for the treatment\\n\\nof depression, but for expanding\\n\\nthe brain's capabilities more generally.\\n\\nSo along those lines, I want to touch on the issues\\n\\nof creativity and the experience of life\\n\\noutside of psychedelic journeys\\n\\nis impacted by psychedelic journeys.\\n\\nAnd here, this relates to a question that I heard a lot\\n\\nwhen I put the call out on social media\\n\\nthat I was going to do this episode,\\n\\nand I asked people,\\n\\nwhat do you want to know about psilocybin?\\n\\nAnd one of the more common questions that I got was,\\n\\ndoes it increase creativity?\\n\\nDoes it increase our experience of life\\n\\nin ways that are beneficial aside\\n\\nfrom it's now documented positive effects\\n\\nin treating depression and compulsive disorders and addiction?\\n\\nAnd the short answer to this is yes,\\n\\nbut that the positive effects of psychedelics,\\n\\npsilocybin in particular on creativity\\n\\nand our experience of life have only been explored\\n\\nin a fairly narrow set of dimensions.\\n\\nHowever, where it's been explored,\\n\\nthere's some really interesting findings.\\n\\nSo one of the more interesting findings I think\\n\\nis a paper entitled increased low frequency brain responses\\n\\nto music after psilocybin therapy for depression.\\n\\nI think this is a really interesting paper\\n\\nbecause what the authors did is they took advantage\\n\\nof the fact that in these therapeutic psilocybin sessions\\n\\nthat are carried out for the treatment of depression,\\n\\nmusic is being played.\\n\\nAnd there are prior studies showing that\\n\\nwhen music is played, you activate different brain areas\\n\\ndepending on what sort of music is being played.\\n\\nThat's somewhat obvious, perhaps,\\n\\nsad music versus intense,\\n\\nyou could think about heavy metal versus choir music\\n\\nversus Gregorian chants versus punk rock music\\n\\nand on and on.\\n\\nIt makes sense that different brain areas would be activated\\n\\nwhen different patterns of music are played.\\n\\nHowever, there do seem to be some universal features\\n\\nof brain activation in response to music.\\n\\nThis should probably be the topic of an entire episode\\n\\nof the Huberman Lab podcast and indeed it will be.\\n\\nFor instance, there are areas of the auditory cortex\\n\\nthat are activated, no surprise there,\\n\\nand areas of the brain's reward circuitry,\\n\\nthe so-called ventral striatum\\n\\nand the so-called mesolimbic reward pathway.\\n\\nTalked a lot about these in the episodes\\n\\nabout dopamine that I've done previously.\\n\\nThese are brain areas that lead to the release of dopamine\\n\\nin other brain areas and that reinforce certain experiences\\n\\nand that tend to give us the subjective feeling of,\\n\\nyes, I like this, I want more.\\n\\nSo in this particular paper,\\n\\nwhat the authors did is they took advantage\\n\\nof the fact that people are in the clinic,\\n\\nthey're on psilocybin, they're listening to music\\n\\nand as you recall, the music played at different stages\\n\\nof the psilocybin journey are different.\\n\\nThey have a different emotional component\\n\\nand music is a really nice stimulus in the laboratory\\n\\nas we say, because like with visual stimuli,\\n\\nyou can break it down into high-frequency, low-frequency.\\n\\nSounds like doon, doon or these kinds of things.\\n\\nThat was my attempt at low frequency\\n\\nversus high frequency auditory stimuli\\n\\nor at the spatial frequency\\n\\nor what in the auditory domain\\n\\nwould be called the temporal frequency.\\n\\nIs it boom, boom, boom or is it boom, boom, boom, boom?\\n\\nAll we've changed there is the temporal frequency.\\n\\nThe sound was somewhat the same\\n\\nbut the distance between those sounds was different.\\n\\nYou get the idea.\\n\\nSo they have access to these people\\n\\nand these different conditions\\n\\nand they can put them in the brain scanner\\n\\nand they can do that before and after\\n\\nhaving taken psilocybin.\\n\\nAnd the long and short of this study\\n\\nis that psilocybin changes one's experience of music,\\n\\nnot just during the psilocybin journey itself\\n\\nbut thereafter.\\n\\nAnd in fact, it changes one's emotional response to music\\n\\nin very interesting ways.\\n\\nFor instance, one of the more common features\\n\\nof major depression is that people don't derive\\n\\nas much pleasure from different types of experiences\\n\\nwhether or not it's food or sex or social experiences\\n\\nto the point where sometimes they just stop\\n\\ntrying to seek out those experiences.\\n\\nPeople with depression often feel\\n\\nas if music no longer has the same impact.\\n\\nIt just doesn't really lift them up very much.\\n\\nThis study found that people who have taken psilocybin\\n\\naccording to the parameters we talked about earlier\\n\\ncan get a return of the elevated emotionality,\\n\\nthe positive emotions associated with music\\n\\nthat formerly made them feel good.\\n\\nIn other words, they can feel music again.\\n\\nThey can feel good in response to music again.\\n\\nNow, this is interesting because in theory,\\n\\nit could be that psilocybin simply allowed them\\n\\nto access the emotions around music again more generally\\n\\nbut that's actually not what this paper\\n\\nand some other papers that have been published report.\\n\\nRather, it seems that taking psilocybin\\n\\ncan increase one's positive perception of music\\n\\nthat one likes and can tone down or reduce the depressiveness\\n\\nor the sadness of music that tends to make one sad\\n\\neven after the psilocybin has worn off\\n\\nand for a long period of time afterwards,\\n\\nmaybe even forever, although no study, of course,\\n\\ncan be carried out forever because forever is forever.\\n\\nWhat we do know, however,\\n\\nis that psilocybin can rewire the connections\\n\\nbetween the emotion centers in the brain\\n\\nand the networks that control auditory perception of music\\n\\nand leads to this condition in which people\\n\\nwho felt like I was depressed or I couldn't feel the music,\\n\\nI just wasn't getting the same lift and joy from it again,\\n\\nthey can start to experience more joy from that music again\\n\\nand that music that made them feel sad and depressed\\n\\nhas a diminished capacity\\n\\nto make them feel sad and depressed.\\n\\nAnd there's a lot of neuroimaging data in this paper\\n\\nthat point to the specific brain areas\\n\\nthat include areas like the ventral tegmental area\\n\\nthat can explain why these sorts of effects would occur.\\n\\nSo this isn't just subjective reports of people saying,\\n\\noh yeah, I was depressed\\n\\nand music didn't feel really good and now it feels great\\n\\nor that used to make me feel so sad\\n\\nand now I feel like I have a capacity to listen to that\\n\\nwithout being crushed by feelings of sadness.\\n\\nThe paper included some subjective reports of that sort,\\n\\nbut then was able to link those to changes\\n\\nin brain circuitry and brain activation\\n\\nin response to music using neuroimaging.\\n\\nSo in that way, it really points to both the subjective\\n\\nand structural and functional changes\\n\\nthat psilocybin can bring about\\n\\nthrough that expanded connectivity between brain areas.\\n\\nBecause remember, during the psilocybin session,\\n\\nit's not as if music or the perception of music\\n\\nis specifically being looked at\\n\\nor focused on in these studies, rather music is playing,\\n\\npeople are in the eye mask,\\n\\nthey're feeling all sorts of things,\\n\\nthey're breathing, they're hearing, they're touch,\\n\\nit's all happening all at once.\\n\\nThere's a peak, it's long,\\n\\nthere's a long taper, the music's changing.\\n\\nOkay, all of that took place in this study as well.\\n\\nBut it is after the session\\n\\nwhen comparing brain activation states\\n\\nto music of a particular type, sad or happy,\\n\\nand comparing that to the patterns of brain activation\\n\\nthat occurred before the psilocybin journey\\n\\nthat they discover that people's brains have rewired\\n\\nduring the psilocybin session in a way\\n\\nthat allows them to experience joy\\n\\nin response to music again.\\n\\nSo that's one of the more rigorous studies\\n\\nI was able to find that addresses this question\\n\\nof whether or not psilocybin really does rewire the brain\\n\\nin ways that allows us to be more creative\\n\\nand experience life differently\\n\\nafter the psilocybin session.\\n\\nNow that paper didn't focus specifically on creativity.\\n\\nI did an entire episode on creativity\\n\\nthat talked about different types of meditation,\\n\\nlike open monitoring meditation,\\n\\nit talked about different patterns of thinking\\n\\nthat one can actually practice to increase creativity.\\n\\nWe had arguably one of the most creative people\\n\\non the planet, Rick Rubin came on this podcast,\\n\\ntalked about the creative process\\n\\nfrom the perspective of music\\n\\nand his role in producing music.\\n\\nSo you can check out those episodes\\n\\nif you're interested in the neural circuitry\\n\\nrelated to creativity.\\n\\nAt least at the time of recording this episode,\\n\\nthere haven't been a lot of studies\\n\\nlooking specifically at the brain networks\\n\\nthat we think are involved in creativity\\n\\nand how those change in response to psilocybin\\n\\nand other psychedelics.\\n\\nI imagine those studies are either happening now\\n\\nor will happen in the future.\\n\\nBut the studies I just described,\\n\\nreferring to the changes in emotionality\\n\\nand responses to music,\\n\\nI think provide a nice template\\n\\nfor what's likely happening both during psilocybin journeys\\n\\nand after those psilocybin journeys.\\n\\nWhen we talk about less hierarchical organization,\\n\\nmore connectivity between brain areas,\\n\\nwhat it's pointing to is the fact that\\n\\nduring the psilocybin journey,\\n\\npeople have the opportunity to learn new relationships\\n\\nbetween different sensory and emotional states.\\n\\nAnd those new relationships seem to persist\\n\\nlong after the psychedelic journey has been finished.\\n\\nAnd a lot of people researching psilocybin\\n\\nin the clinical setting\\n\\nthink that that's one of the major reasons\\n\\nwhy psilocybin and other psychedelics\\n\\ncan rewire our relationship to things more broadly.\\n\\nIt allows for new learning, new contingencies.\\n\\nAnd when we look at depression,\\n\\nwe often think, you know, diminished mood,\\n\\npeople now have an appetite,\\n\\nthey're not interested in social relationships\\n\\nor romantic relationships, they're really struggling.\\n\\nAnd all of that, of course, is true.\\n\\nBut another lens to look at depression through\\n\\nis that a lot of that thinking\\n\\nand a lot of those emotional states that are negative\\n\\nare somewhat habitual.\\n\\nThey relate to a sort of implicit understanding\\n\\nand living out of the idea that A leads to B leads to C.\\n\\nOkay, you seek out a relationship, it doesn't work out.\\n\\nYou try a new job, you don't get the job.\\n\\nYou get the job, it's no good.\\n\\nAll these negative outcomes of if A, then B, then C.\\n\\nAnd it does seem that psilocybin can have this effect\\n\\nof invoking new patterns of learning,\\n\\nnew considerations about what might be possible.\\n\\nAnd indeed may even lead to actual rewiring\\n\\nof the emotion centers in the brain\\n\\nwith these other brain areas and vice versa\\n\\nin ways that eject people from the psilocybin session,\\n\\nthinking, oh, you know, yeah,\\n\\nI used to feel this way about something,\\n\\nwork, relationships, myself, et cetera,\\n\\nbut I'm willing to consider this other possibility\\n\\nor this other possibility seems at least partially true\\n\\nto the extent that I'm willing to go out and evaluate that.\\n\\nNow, here I'm speaking very subjectively,\\n\\nbut remember we have to tie back the subjective experiences\\n\\nand changes of things like music and emotion\\n\\nand our relationship to life and jobs and relationships\\n\\nback to the cell biology and chemistry of psilocybin\\n\\nbecause ultimately it really is\\n\\njust a chemical activating receptors,\\n\\nthose receptors changing networks in the brain.\\n\\nAnd the journey itself seems to be the time\\n\\nwhen all of those changes are put in motion.\\n\\nIt's like a boulder that gets rolling.\\n\\nIn fact, I think the best way to think about psilocybin\\n\\nand other psychedelics is that they initiate\\n\\nthe neuroplasticity process,\\n\\nbut they are not the neuroplasticity process itself.\\n\\nAnd the journey itself is not\\n\\nwhere all the neuroplasticity occurs.\\n\\nWe know that for sure.\\n\\nIn fact, if you want to imagine how psilocybin\\n\\nand other psychedelics work to change the brain,\\n\\nthink about them as a wedge that gets underneath the boulder\\n\\nthat is the neuroplasticity\\n\\nthat gets rolling forward.\\n\\nAnd then think about whether or not the plasticity\\n\\nis adaptive or maladaptive,\\n\\nwhether or not it actually serves you in your life\\n\\non a daily basis or not,\\n\\ndepending on whether or not you're using\\n\\nyour conscious brain to move that boulder\\n\\nin a particular direction, right?\\n\\nNot just bulldozing through things and destroying them,\\n\\nbut clearing a path through old, ineffective,\\n\\nmaybe even destructive patterns of thoughts\\n\\nor emotions, et cetera.\\n\\nI give you that analogy because I think\\n\\nit more accurately captures what psychedelics\\n\\nlike psilocybin are doing,\\n\\nrather than the typical discussion around psychedelics\\n\\nthat we tend to hear, which is that,\\n\\noh, it creates plasticity and plasticity is what you want.\\n\\nFor the next couple of minutes,\\n\\nI'd like to focus on some of the key and stereotype\\n\\nthat is characteristic experiences that people tend to have\\n\\nduring a psilocybin journey,\\n\\nbecause there's some really interesting research on this.\\n\\nThese are phrases that perhaps you've heard before,\\n\\nthings like letting go, ego dissolution,\\n\\nfeelings of connectedness.\\n\\nWhile all of that is very subjective on the one hand,\\n\\nthose words are heard often enough and repeatedly enough\\n\\nin psilocybin sessions and after psilocybin sessions,\\n\\nalong with this description of the psilocybin experience\\n\\nas one of the most profound of one's life,\\n\\nor one of the most positive in the ideal case\\n\\nof one's life, that they are worth exploring.\\n\\nWe should also, of course, explore the so-called bad trip,\\n\\nthe possibility that someone will have a not good time\\n\\nor even very frightening time\\n\\nwhile under the influence of psilocybin.\\n\\nSo there have been some scientific studies\\n\\nthat have explored what sorts of subjective experiences,\\n\\nthat is thoughts and feelings, insights that people have\\n\\nthat relate to positive therapeutic outcomes.\\n\\nAnd more generally with the sense\\n\\nthat the psilocybin journey was positive\\n\\nor maybe even tremendously positive in one's life.\\n\\nSo while there's a century or more\\n\\nof writings about psychedelics that describe things\\n\\nlike enhanced feelings of connectedness\\n\\nor dissolution of the ego, the loss of one sense of self,\\n\\nand then the regaining of one sense of self and so on.\\n\\nThere is a particular paper that describes\\n\\nsome of those things in terms of rating scales,\\n\\nthat is the sorts of tests that people can take\\n\\nin which they answer particular questions\\n\\nand that link back to things like feelings of connectedness\\n\\nand ego dissolution that allows us to put some numbers\\n\\nto those experiences and to look at some of the statistics\\n\\nassociated with those experiences.\\n\\nAnd this is really what's important\\n\\nabout scientific studies, whether or not a measure\\n\\nis subjective, so someone's self-reporting\\n\\nhow they felt or feel, or whether or not\\n\\nit's measure of blood pressure\\n\\nor of a chemical in the bloodstream, et cetera.\\n\\nIt's the use of numbers and statistics\\n\\nthat allows comparison between different groups\\n\\nand that can be compared between studies\\n\\nthat allows us to make some firm conclusions\\n\\nabout what sorts of things psilocybin may\\n\\nor may not be doing when it's effective or not.\\n\\nSo the paper I'd like to highlight is entitled,\\n\\nQuality of Acute Psychedelic Experience\\n\\nPredicts Therapeutic Efficacy of Psilocybin\\n\\nfor Treatment-Resistant Depression.\\n\\nI'll put a link to this paper in the show note captions.\\n\\nBut the basic contour of this paper is that\\n\\nthey looked at subjects that underwent\\n\\ntwo different psilocybin sessions,\\n\\none at a relatively low-ish dose of 10 milligrams\\n\\nof psilocybin, and that would be equivalent\\n\\nto about one gram of psychedelic mushrooms, more or less.\\n\\nAnd a second session involving subjects taking\\n\\n25 milligrams of psilocybin, or what's roughly equivalent\\n\\nto somebody taking two and a half grams\\n\\nof psilocybin mushrooms.\\n\\nThose people then answered what's called\\n\\nthe Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire,\\n\\nwhich allowed them to address,\\n\\nand here I'm paraphrasing, the quality of experiences\\n\\nin the 25 milligrams psilocybin session.\\n\\nSo without going into too much detail,\\n\\nit's often the case in these sorts of two-session studies\\n\\nthat subjects will take a slightly lower dose of psilocybin\\n\\nto familiarize themselves with the experience,\\n\\nand then the higher dose that leads\\n\\nto the more intense experience,\\n\\nintense meaning a bigger, more intense peak,\\n\\na longer session overall, greater distortions\\n\\nin emotionality and perceptual experience,\\n\\nall the stuff we talked about before.\\n\\nSo what this study found is that one of the key features,\\n\\nif not the key feature, of a positive, quote unquote,\\n\\npsychedelic experience is this sense\\n\\nof oceanic boundlessness occurring at some point\\n\\nduring the psychedelic journey.\\n\\nNow, oceanic boundlessness doesn't necessarily mean anything\\n\\nto any of us.\\n\\nIt probably means different things to different people.\\n\\nIt's this idea that one is experiencing something\\n\\nextremely unusual, even mystical,\\n\\nkind of beyond this world and one's normal experience,\\n\\nbut that it's not aligned with any specific outcome\\n\\nin the moment.\\n\\nIt's not directly attached to any one feeling\\n\\nor memory or thought process.\\n\\nIt's this, I think it's a little bit tough to describe\\n\\nbecause I can guarantee you,\\n\\nI'm not on psilocybin or any psychedelics right now,\\n\\nand I can only imagine that you're not,\\n\\nalthough some of you might be.\\n\\nI can't even imagine what this podcast would be like\\n\\nfor somebody on psilocybin at this moment,\\n\\nbut in any case, oceanic boundlessness,\\n\\na feeling of the experience being mystical\\n\\nand not really heading in any one particular direction,\\n\\njust a feeling of massive connectedness\\n\\nwith one's environment, both in the room and session,\\n\\nperhaps with the guides, with oneself, with one's past,\\n\\nwith one's present, people outside the room,\\n\\nwith the entire world, maybe even the universe,\\n\\nthat sort of thing.\\n\\nThe intensity of that experience of oceanic boundlessness,\\n\\nthe mystical experience seems to be positively correlated\\n\\nwith positive therapeutic outcomes,\\n\\nthat is relief from major depression.\\n\\nNow, during the psychedelic journey,\\n\\nas we talked about before,\\n\\nthere are a number of steps that one typically goes through.\\n\\nSo there's the buildup to first experiencing\\n\\nthe effects of the drug,\\n\\nabout maybe 20 to 45 minutes into the journey or trip,\\n\\nthen the peak, and it is during that peak\\n\\nthat people often feel the sense of oceanic boundlessness.\\n\\nHowever, it's also often the case\\n\\nthat it is during the peak,\\n\\nwhere the maximum intensity of emotion,\\n\\nand we know based on direct measurements,\\n\\nalso increases in blood pressure and heart rate,\\n\\noften very significant increases in anxiety and fear as well,\\n\\nthat people will experience things like ego dissolution.\\n\\nAnd the guide's role at that point\\n\\nis of course to keep the person safe,\\n\\nmake sure they don't run out of the room,\\n\\njump out of a window, run into traffic.\\n\\nSadly, these are things that have happened\\n\\noutside of a strong, healthy, safe set and setting.\\n\\nBut the guide's role is to keep the person safe,\\n\\nbut also to encourage them to let go\\n\\nand move through that experience,\\n\\nto experience the anxiety, allow it to peak,\\n\\nallow them to see that they're not going to die\\n\\nfrom that anxiety, they're not going to dissolve,\\n\\nthey won't lose their sense of self completely,\\n\\nor they may temporarily feel\\n\\nas if they lose their sense of self,\\n\\nbut then they feel it restored\\n\\nat various intervals during the peak\\n\\nor as they exit that peak and move toward the,\\n\\nsay, second, third, fourth, fifth hour of the session.\\n\\nSo when exactly these feelings of oceanic boundlessness\\n\\nand ego dissolution occur,\\n\\nvaries from person to person,\\n\\nbut typically it's during the peak\\n\\nthat the ego dissolution,\\n\\nthe fear and the need to quote unquote let go\\n\\nis most typical.\\n\\nI think perhaps the best way to describe the data\\n\\nin this paper in a way that's meaningful to everybody\\n\\nis to refer you to figure two,\\n\\nwhich if you're not looking at the paper,\\n\\nwon't mean anything to you, but I'll describe it.\\n\\nAnd if you do want to take a look at figure two,\\n\\nagain, you can access the paper in the show note captions.\\n\\nWhat they did is they looked at\\n\\na number of different subjective measures,\\n\\nthings like experience of unity,\\n\\nthe feeling that one is connected to others and to the world,\\n\\nthings like spirituality,\\n\\nwhether or not the whole thing\\n\\nfelt like a spiritual experience,\\n\\nwhether or not it was a blissful state,\\n\\nwhether or not there were insights,\\n\\nwhether or not somebody felt disembodied, out of body,\\n\\nwhether or not somebody had a lot of anxiety,\\n\\nwhether or not they had these synesthesias,\\n\\nthese blending of visual auditory touch and breathing\\n\\nand things of that sort.\\n\\nAnd they addressed which of those measures\\n\\nrelated to the positive clinical outcomes\\n\\nthat were observed later after the psilocybin wore off.\\n\\nAnd while I'm not going to go point by point\\n\\nthrough each one of these measures,\\n\\nthere's a general feature to emerge from the study,\\n\\nwhich is that the experience of unity,\\n\\nthe sense that the psilocybin journey was spiritual,\\n\\nan experience of bliss at some point\\n\\ninside of the psilocybin journey,\\n\\nthe sense that there were insights,\\n\\nthat there were learnings about one's life and oneself.\\n\\nWhen those things were experienced very strongly,\\n\\nthat correlated with the person being\\n\\nwhat was called a responder to the psilocybin treatment,\\n\\nmeaning they got relief from their depression.\\n\\nWhereas people who felt less of that, okay?\\n\\nSo the non-responders, as they're called,\\n\\nthe people who do not benefit so much in the long run\\n\\nfrom the psilocybin treatment\\n\\ntended to report less of an experience of unity,\\n\\nless of a spiritual experience,\\n\\nless of a blissful state, less insightfulness, and so on.\\n\\nWhereas there were very few differences\\n\\nbetween the people that derived benefit\\n\\nfrom the psilocybin treatment and those did not\\n\\nalong the dimensions of synesthesia,\\n\\nthis blending of different perceptions\\n\\nthat ordinarily doesn't occur for most people.\\n\\nOr complex imagery, right?\\n\\nPut simply, everyone who took psilocybin in this study\\n\\nat 25 milligrams saw complex imagery.\\n\\nThey saw a lot of hallucinations,\\n\\nbut just seeing hallucinations did not lead\\n\\nto the positive clinical outcomes in terms of mood.\\n\\nAnxiety was a very interesting measure here\\n\\nbecause ordinarily we think of the ego dissolution,\\n\\nthe letting go is such a key component\\n\\nof the psychedelic journey\\n\\nin terms of the positive therapeutic outcomes.\\n\\nThis has been discussed quite a lot.\\n\\nAnd in full disclosure, Robin Carter Harris\\n\\nhas already come on to record an episode\\n\\nof the Huberman Lab podcast.\\n\\nThat episode hasn't been released yet,\\n\\nbut it will be released soon.\\n\\nAnd he talks about the importance of this letting go\\n\\nin terms of the positive clinical outcomes\\n\\nof the psilocybin journey.\\n\\nAnd indeed that is true.\\n\\nAnd I should also mention that Dr. Matthew Johnson\\n\\nfrom Johns Hopkins who also runs a laboratory\\n\\nexploring psychedelics and their role\\n\\nin treating things like eating disorders\\n\\nand depression, et cetera, also doing incredible work.\\n\\nAlso talked about the importance of letting go\\n\\nduring the psilocybin journey, this ego dissolution,\\n\\nthis ability to move through the anxiety.\\n\\nAnd again, I can't underscore this enough\\n\\nbecause it's been told to me over and over again\\n\\nby the top researchers in this area\\n\\nthat people will head into that peaking phase\\n\\nof the psilocybin journey.\\n\\nAnd oftentimes it is not pleasant for them.\\n\\nThey're feeling like it's uncomfortable.\\n\\nIt's scary and their heart rate is up\\n\\nand their blood pressure is up\\n\\nand they're having a hard time calming down\\n\\nthan they want to calm down.\\n\\nBut it does seem that while the guides\\n\\nshould not ramp them up and get them more stressed,\\n\\nthat the ability to move through that stressful period\\n\\nto somewhat guide oneself or to be encouraged\\n\\nto guide oneself through that peak and that anxiety\\n\\nand that fear of losing oneself\\n\\nand the so-called ego dissolution that occurs\\n\\nis an important feature\\n\\nfor an effective therapeutic session.\\n\\nIn this study, anxiety itself was inversely correlated\\n\\nwith a positive therapeutic outcome.\\n\\nOkay, so this is important and somewhat nuanced.\\n\\nOn the one hand, I'm telling you that the letting go,\\n\\nthe ego dissolution does seem to be important\\n\\nin terms of reporting a psychedelic experience\\n\\nas effective as having accomplished something\\n\\nand perhaps even explaining some of the long-term\\n\\npositive effects to emerge from that psychedelic journey,\\n\\nin this case, psilocybin journey.\\n\\nHowever, non-responders, that is people who did psilocybin\\n\\nbut did not have a positive therapeutic outcome\\n\\nin comparison to the responders,\\n\\nthose non-responders tended to have higher subjective\\n\\nratings of anxiety than did the responders.\\n\\nSo this is important.\\n\\nAnd what it speaks to is the fact that, well, yes,\\n\\nletting go during the session, experiencing some anxiety,\\n\\nperhaps even ego dissolution and the dissolving of self\\n\\nand then the return of self is important.\\n\\nIt is also important, it seems,\\n\\nthat anxiety not be so, so high\\n\\nor subjectively experienced as so high\\n\\nthat one does not experience the positive neuronal rewiring\\n\\nthat leads to a more pervasive elevated mood.\\n\\nOkay, so I'm definitely saying two things at once\\n\\nbecause I'm trying to capture the data accurately.\\n\\nIt would not be fair for me to say,\\n\\njust let go, experience as much anxiety as is possible.\\n\\nAnd that's part of the process.\\n\\nYes, letting go, again, an air quote seems to be important\\n\\nfor one's experience of the psychedelic journey\\n\\nin particular around the peak\\n\\nthat occurs about two hours in or so.\\n\\nHowever, extreme levels of anxiety\\n\\nseem inversely correlated or negatively correlated,\\n\\nwould be the better way to put it,\\n\\nwith the positive therapeutic outcome\\n\\nor relief from depression.\\n\\nSo this takes us back to all of the things\\n\\nwe've been talking about thus far,\\n\\nnot just the chemistry and biological action of psilocybin,\\n\\nbut the key importance of getting dosage right,\\n\\nthe key importance of making sure\\n\\nthat you're in a safe environment,\\n\\nbut also one in which the guides\\n\\nreally know what they're doing.\\n\\nI think this is one of the biggest and most important reasons\\n\\nfor having well-trained guides\\n\\nwho really understand the contour of the psychedelic journey,\\n\\nbut are also trained in how to help somebody\\n\\nwith their anxiety in real time\\n\\nwhile they're under the effects of psilocybin.\\n\\nAnd of course, to help people integrate those feelings\\n\\nof high anxiety and maybe guide them back down\\n\\nto a calmer state during the psychedelic session itself.\\n\\nAnd here I can just mention\\n\\nsome unpublished data and studies.\\n\\nAnd again, these are very preliminary,\\n\\nbut through discussions with Dr. Matthew Johnson,\\n\\nwho's running these psilocybin\\n\\nand other sorts of psychedelic trials at Johns Hopkins,\\n\\nhe and I discussed the importance\\n\\nof having a real-time tool to adjust anxiety\\n\\nwhile under the influence of psychedelics like psilocybin.\\n\\nAnd there he asked, and they've started to incorporate,\\n\\nis my understanding, some of the real-time respiration tools,\\n\\nthat is breathing tools,\\n\\nthat we know based on work in my laboratory,\\n\\nDr. David Spiegel's laboratory,\\n\\ncan reduce anxiety very quickly in real time.\\n\\nAnd that involves the use\\n\\nof the so-called physiological psi.\\n\\nI've talked a lot about this before on previous podcasts.\\n\\nSo rather than explain it to you again here now,\\n\\nwe'll put a link to the physiological psi.\\n\\nI do a demonstration of it in the show note captions.\\n\\nI'll also link to a recent paper\\n\\nthat we published in Cell Reports Medicine.\\n\\nThis was a collaborative work that my laboratory did\\n\\nwith Dr. David Spiegel's laboratory\\n\\nat Stanford School of Medicine,\\n\\nshowing that the physiological size,\\n\\namong the different deliberate respiration techniques,\\n\\none of the fastest and most effective ways\\n\\nto reduce levels of autonomic arousal,\\n\\nAKA anxiety or stress.\\n\\nAnd Dr. Matthew Johnson's laboratory\\n\\nstarted to incorporate physiological size\\n\\nwithin these psychedelic sessions as a tool\\n\\nthat the guides can refer people to\\n\\nbefore the session begins, teaching it to them,\\n\\nso they realize they can calm themselves down\\n\\nif necessary in real time.\\n\\nIt works the first time, it works every time.\\n\\nThis is not because it's some magic breathing technique\\n\\nthat I created, it certainly is not.\\n\\nThis is a naturally occurring pattern of breathing\\n\\nthat occurs in sleep and in waking,\\n\\nbut that when done deliberately leads to very rapid\\n\\nand quite significant decreases in stress and anxiety.\\n\\nAnd then when people are inside of the psychedelic session,\\n\\nif they feel their anxiety levels are going too high,\\n\\nthey're heading toward what might be called\\n\\na quote unquote bad trip.\\n\\nThey're starting to panic,\\n\\nor really think they're going to have a panic attack or die.\\n\\nAgain, the subjective experience is going to be layered\\n\\non top of the physiological experience\\n\\nof one's heart rate being really elevated,\\n\\nso stress and agitation.\\n\\nBy using the physiological sigh\\n\\ninside of the psychedelic session,\\n\\nDr. Johnson's laboratory,\\n\\nand I believe at least one other laboratory\\n\\nare starting to use breathing techniques\\n\\nsuch as the physiological sigh\\n\\nas a way for these people\\n\\nwho are under the influence of psilocybin\\n\\nto self-direct their own calm,\\n\\nand to bring that level of anxiety down\\n\\nso that they can continue to move through the peak\\n\\nand move through the other phases\\n\\nof the psychedelic journey in ways\\n\\nthat could be most beneficial for them.\\n\\nSo to close out the description\\n\\nof this really wonderful study,\\n\\nand by the way, it's another one\\n\\nfrom the Cardhart-Harris Laboratory\\n\\nabout the subjective experience of ego dissolution\\n\\nor oceanic boundlessness, this mystical state,\\n\\nas so key as a component of a positive psilocybin journey.\\n\\nI'll just read for you the final sentence of this paper\\n\\nbecause it captures it so well.\\n\\nQuote, it seems vital that appropriate consideration\\n\\nis paid to the importance of promoting\\n\\na certain kind of experience\\n\\nas the quality of that experience\\n\\nmay be the critical determinant of therapeutic success.\\n\\nNow, before we move into\\n\\nwhat will be a very brief description\\n\\nof some of the other rewiring phenomena\\n\\nthat psilocybin can induce,\\n\\nand then into some of the therapeutic applications\\n\\nof psilocybin as they relate to these recent,\\n\\nreally exciting clinical trials for depression\\n\\nand addictive disorders and things of that sort,\\n\\nI just want to cue everybody to a paper\\n\\nthat I think many people will want to take a look at\\n\\nin thinking about psilocybin,\\n\\nand I'll provide a link to this paper as well\\n\\nin the show note captions.\\n\\nThis paper is entitled\\n\\nTherapeutic Use of Psilocybin,\\n\\nPractical Considerations for Dosing and Administration.\\n\\nAnd this is a wonderful paper\\n\\nbecause it really goes step by step\\n\\nthrough the pharmacology of psilocybin,\\n\\nof which you now understand a bit,\\n\\nbut it goes into a bit more detail.\\n\\nBut then it also really nicely describes\\n\\nthe contour of a psilocybin session\\n\\nand what's happening at the level of chemistry,\\n\\nearly, middle, peak,\\n\\nand toward the end of the psilocybin session.\\n\\nAnd then also importantly,\\n\\nit gets into issues of dosage\\n\\nand translating from mushrooms to psilocybin itself\\n\\nto psilocin, things I talked about earlier,\\n\\nbut in a bit more detail,\\n\\nif you'd like to see that detail.\\n\\nAnd then perhaps most importantly,\\n\\nthere's a section on contraindications\\n\\nwhere it points out that of course,\\n\\nwomen who are pregnant or breastfeeding,\\n\\npeople who have a predisposition to psychosis,\\n\\nthose people should really avoid the use of psilocybin\\n\\nand other psychedelics entirely.\\n\\nIt also talks about where the evidence is strong,\\n\\nmoderate, and weak for the use of psilocybin\\n\\nfor treatment of various disorders.\\n\\nAnd I can just summarize that very quickly\\n\\nbecause it's where we're going ahead in a few minutes,\\n\\nwhich is that the most evidence\\n\\nfor positive therapeutic outcomes\\n\\nin response to psilocybin taken and conducted\\n\\nin the manner that we've been describing today\\n\\nin terms of dosage and journey set and setting\\n\\nis for cancer-related depression,\\n\\ncancer-related anxiety,\\n\\nand treatment-resistant depression.\\n\\nThat's where most of the evidence resides.\\n\\nThere's also some evidence\\n\\nfor the use of psilocybin journeys.\\n\\nAnd again, this is typically one or two psilocybin journeys\\n\\nspaced in the cases of two journeys,\\n\\nanywhere from one to two weeks apart.\\n\\nAnd again, with all of the same contour of supports\\n\\nand setting that we've been talking about today.\\n\\nAnd there, there's some evidence for improvement\\n\\nin terms of outcomes in alcohol use disorder independence\\n\\nand tobacco addiction.\\n\\nAnd then finally, there's the least amount of evidence,\\n\\nalthough there is clinical trial support\\n\\nfor relief or partial relief,\\n\\nfor obsessive-compulsive disorder,\\n\\ncluster headaches and migraines,\\n\\nand demoralization due to AIDS diagnosis, okay?\\n\\nSo this paper has a lot of really interesting information\\n\\nin terms of different conditions, in terms of dosage,\\n\\nand again, contra-intigrations\\n\\nand what's called adverse events,\\n\\nwhat sorts of bad things can and do happen\\n\\nas a consequence of psilocybin\\n\\nand other types of psychedelic journeys,\\n\\nboth during and after those psilocybin\\n\\nor psychedelic sessions.\\n\\nAnd we'll talk a bit more about this\\n\\nwhen we go into some of those clinical studies,\\n\\nbecause adverse reactions is always a key measure\\n\\nin any clinical study.\\n\\nSo very soon we'll get into the more recent clinical studies\\n\\nrelated to psilocybin for the use of treating depression\\n\\nand some other conditions.\\n\\nBut before we do that, I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about\\n\\nhow psilocybin does and does not change the brain,\\n\\nwhat is and what is not known about that.\\n\\nIn fact, when I put out the call for questions\\n\\nabout psilocybin, many of the questions\\n\\nrelated to these issues.\\n\\nThe first thing to understand is that a psilocybin journey\\n\\nis really a way to try and put that wedge under the boulder,\\n\\nas I described it, to try and invoke neuroplasticity\\n\\nof a particular kind.\\n\\nAnd in that way, it's kind of remarkable,\\n\\nif you think about it,\\n\\nthat everyone has different lives, different experiences.\\n\\nPsychedelics, in this case, psilocybin,\\n\\nare activating these brain networks that each of us has,\\n\\nmore broadly than they would normally be activated.\\n\\nThese are very abnormal patterns of thinking and perceiving\\n\\nand experiencing our emotional and physical life, et cetera.\\n\\nAnd yet, so often, the outcomes are positive,\\n\\nnot always, but the outcomes are positive,\\n\\nthe experience is positive,\\n\\neven though it might have these anxiety moments\\n\\nor components within them.\\n\\nIt's very important to understand that psilocybin\\n\\nand the journey, while important,\\n\\nare not really what all of this is about.\\n\\nIt's really about neuroplasticity.\\n\\nSo researchers, in particular neuroscientists,\\n\\nare very intensely interested in understanding\\n\\nwhat sorts of neuroplasticity psilocybin creates,\\n\\nbecause it turns out there are lots of different types\\n\\nor processes involved with neuroplasticity.\\n\\nFor instance, brain networks, behavior, thinking, emotion,\\n\\net cetera, can change\\n\\nbecause of the addition of new neurons.\\n\\nThat's one form of neuroplasticity\\n\\nthat's referred to as neurogenesis,\\n\\nthe production of new neurons,\\n\\nmost typically in the so-called dentate gyrus\\n\\nor other subregions of the hippocampus,\\n\\na brain area involved in learning and memory.\\n\\nNeurogenesis in other regions of the adult human brain\\n\\nare exceedingly rare and, to be honest,\\n\\nmay not occur at all.\\n\\nThis is a debated area.\\n\\nWe could do an entire episode about this,\\n\\nbut for the most part,\\n\\nneuroscientists don't really believe that your neocortex,\\n\\nyour striatum, your cerebellum,\\n\\nhas that much neurogenesis\\n\\nthat's related to learning and memory of new things\\n\\nor new experiences.\\n\\nAnd we don't actually think that occurs\\n\\nas a consequence of taking psilocybin either.\\n\\nNow, some of you who are familiar with, for instance,\\n\\nthe cerebellum might be saying,\\n\\nwait, what about granular cell proliferation\\n\\nin the cerebellum?\\n\\nOr what about the rostral migratory stream\\n\\nfrom the subventricular zone\\n\\nwhere there are neuroblasts spitting out\\n\\nlittle new neurons that migrate into the nose\\n\\nto replenish the olfactory neuron population?\\n\\nYes, that's all true.\\n\\nThat does occur.\\n\\nIt's been observed in mice.\\n\\nIt's been observed in monkeys.\\n\\nAnd to some extent, it's been observed in humans.\\n\\nBut it's not, again, I repeat,\\n\\nit is not a prominent feature of learning\\n\\nand acquisition of new skills,\\n\\nnew ideas or new emotional states.\\n\\nPerhaps the best supported evidence for neurogenesis\\n\\nunderlying new thoughts, experiences, abilities,\\n\\nemotions, et cetera,\\n\\nis the production of new neurons\\n\\nin that dentate gyrus subregion of the hippocampus.\\n\\nAnd that probably does occur in humans.\\n\\nBut neurogenesis is not really the dominant mode\\n\\nof changing neural circuitry in adult humans.\\n\\nIt might be a player in adolescence, in young childhood.\\n\\nIt is certainly a player before we are born\\n\\nwhen we are still in utero.\\n\\nBut then the brain is being wired up\\n\\nin many different ways,\\n\\nincluding the addition of new neurons\\n\\nand changing of connections.\\n\\nAll this is to say that while neurogenesis\\n\\nis a really sticky idea and it makes great headlines,\\n\\nthe addition of new neurons\\n\\nis not really the way that the brain changes\\n\\nunder psilocybin, other psychedelics, or just generally.\\n\\nIt's perhaps responsible for maybe 1% to 2%,\\n\\nand I'm being generous there,\\n\\nof the rewiring events\\n\\nthat are going to be most important for all of us.\\n\\nSo we need to set that down and cement that there\\n\\nuntil further evidence comes out to the contrary.\\n\\nThat's certainly where I,\\n\\nand here I feel comfortable speaking\\n\\nfor the majority of neuroscientists out there,\\n\\nprofessional neuroscientists, that is.\\n\\nThe papers showing adult neurogenesis are interesting,\\n\\nbut they don't really explain most of the plasticity\\n\\nthat occurs in the adult human brain.\\n\\nSo if neurogenesis ain't it, what is?\\n\\nWell, it's very clear that psilocybin, other psychedelics,\\n\\nand any sort of behavioral or drug intervention\\n\\nthat can induce neuroplasticity does so largely\\n\\nthrough the addition or strengthening\\n\\nof new neural connections or through the elimination\\n\\nor weakening of other neural connections.\\n\\nAnd if you look at the data exploring the mechanistic basis\\n\\nfor psilocybin-induced neuroplasticity,\\n\\nit's mostly focused on animal brains, animal models,\\n\\nmice and rats in particular, a little bit on primates,\\n\\nbut mostly mice and rats,\\n\\nbecause that's where the interventions can be done\\n\\nof knockout animals, of imaging the brain in real time.\\n\\nOf course, there are the beautiful studies\\n\\nof Robin Cardhart-Harris and others\\n\\nexploring neuroplasticity at the level of brain imaging,\\n\\nat the level of ultrasound measurements,\\n\\nof how active are certain brain areas in humans,\\n\\nhow extensive is the modularity\\n\\nor not extensive is the modularity, et cetera,\\n\\nthe stuff we talked about earlier.\\n\\nSo in other words, there are neuroplasticity studies\\n\\nfor the effects of psilocybin in humans.\\n\\nBut in terms of underlying mechanisms of neuroplasticity,\\n\\nI think the predominant theory\\n\\nis that psilocybin induces neuroplasticity\\n\\nthrough the addition of novel connections\\n\\nin those pyramidal neurons of the frontal cortex\\n\\nelsewhere in the cortex,\\n\\nand certainly also in the visual cortex,\\n\\nprobably also subcortically as well\\n\\nbelow the cerebral cortex in areas like the thalamus,\\n\\nmaybe even in the brainstem as well.\\n\\nAnd that those neuroplasticity events\\n\\nare structural and functional,\\n\\nand they involve a couple of basic events,\\n\\nthe most prominent of which is the growth of dendrites.\\n\\nDendrites are those little branches or processes\\n\\nthat come out of the neurons,\\n\\nnot just the pyramidal neurons, but other neurons as well.\\n\\nBut since we're talking mainly about\\n\\npyramidal neurons today,\\n\\nboth the apical, those ones that top,\\n\\nthey're called the apical tufts,\\n\\nthey're the ones that reach laterally\\n\\nto connect with other neurons,\\n\\ncommunicate with other neurons that we talked about before,\\n\\nas well as the dendrites that come out of the base\\n\\nof those pyramidal neurons.\\n\\nThose processes grow in response to psilocybin,\\n\\nas well as the addition of what are called dendritic spine.\\n\\nSo the dendrites are the branches,\\n\\nthe spines are these little protrusions that grow out.\\n\\nThey actually, and here,\\n\\nI don't know if this is coincidence or not.\\n\\nAgain, I always say I wasn't consult the design phase,\\n\\nbut these little protrusions\\n\\nactually look like little mushrooms.\\n\\nThey have a little stalk and they have a little head,\\n\\na little spine head, and those little spine.\\n\\nSo think of these as like little tiny mushroom appearing.\\n\\nOkay, they aren't actual mushrooms.\\n\\nOkay, the first person that puts in the comments,\\n\\noh my goodness, I learned today\\n\\nthat mushrooms grow out of our neurons\\n\\nwhen we take magic mushrooms.\\n\\nThat is not what I'm saying.\\n\\nWhat I'm saying is that\\n\\nthese little mushroom-shaped protrusions\\n\\nthat we're calling dendritic spines\\n\\ndo in fact grow out of dendritic branches of neurons\\n\\nwhen animals ingest psilocybin\\n\\nor are injected with psilocybin,\\n\\nand that those little mushroom-shaped protrusions\\n\\nare the sites of new excitatory connections,\\n\\nnew locations for input from other neurons\\n\\nto activate those neurons\\n\\nthat have those little mushroom-shaped protrusions.\\n\\nIf you'd like to see examples of this,\\n\\nboth movies and still shots, it's pretty remarkable.\\n\\nThere's a paper that I'll provide a link to\\n\\nin the show note captions.\\n\\nThis was published in the journal Neuron,\\n\\ncell press journal, excellent journal,\\n\\nentitled, psilocybin induces rapid and persistent growth\\n\\nof dendritic spines in the frontal cortex in vivo.\\n\\nSo these measurements were done in the mouse equivalent,\\n\\nmore or less, of the prefrontal cortex.\\n\\nThere's some interesting details in this paper,\\n\\nfor instance, that those new connections persist,\\n\\nso they don't just grow out during the psilocybin\\n\\nbeing active in the bloodstream and brain of the animal,\\n\\nthey persist, okay, so this may, again,\\n\\nmay explain some of the persistent changes\\n\\nthat occur in people after psilocybin journeys.\\n\\nThey may, too, grow new spines.\\n\\nI should also mention that a reduction\\n\\nin the number of dendritic spines,\\n\\nthese little mushroom-shaped protrusions\\n\\nin the frontal cortex neurons of humans\\n\\noccurs in depressed patients.\\n\\nWe know that from post-mortem tissue,\\n\\nand that drugs that relieve depression or that treatments,\\n\\nincluding behavioral treatments,\\n\\nthat provide some relief from depression\\n\\ndo seem to be correlated with increases in spine growth\\n\\nin frontal cortex neurons as well.\\n\\nSo this raises a very interesting idea,\\n\\nwhich is perhaps it's the growth of new connections,\\n\\nthese new dendritic spines, in particular, neurons\\n\\nthat's created by administration of psilocybin\\n\\nthat explains the relief from depression\\n\\nthat people experience.\\n\\nSo this is just one paper,\\n\\nbut it's one paper of a growing body of work\\n\\nshowing that, yes, indeed, psilocybin induces\\n\\nboth structural and functional plasticity\\n\\nin the human and animal brain.\\n\\nIt does that in the human brain at therapeutic doses\\n\\nof anywhere from 10 to 25,\\n\\nperhaps even 30 milligrams per session, one or two sessions.\\n\\nI should mention that the mouse studies\\n\\ntended to use quite high doses of psilocybin.\\n\\nI was actually, I wasn't shocked,\\n\\nbut I was somewhat wide-eyed for a moment\\n\\nto realize that most of the studies\\n\\nlooking at changes in plasticity in the mouse brain\\n\\nin response to psilocybin use the equivalent\\n\\nof one milligram per kilogram of body weight,\\n\\nwhich is if you do the math and you translate\\n\\nwhat we were talking about before in terms of dosages,\\n\\nI'll just spare you all the time,\\n\\nit's about double the sorts of dosages\\n\\nthat are typically used in humans,\\n\\nmaybe even triple in some cases.\\n\\nNow, it's often the case in animal studies\\n\\nbecause of the metabolism of animals being different,\\n\\nbut also because seeing effects of drugs\\n\\nin animal studies can be difficult.\\n\\nThey did use a dose response anywhere from zero\\n\\nto 0.25 to half to one to two milligrams per kilogram\\n\\nof psilocybin in the study,\\n\\nso they had a dose response curve,\\n\\nbut focused mainly on this one milligram per kilogram dosage.\\n\\nIn any event, the point is that many of the studies\\n\\nthat describe these pretty dramatic structural changes\\n\\nin the animal brain, most typically the mouse brain\\n\\nin response to psilocybin,\\n\\nuse dosages of psilocybin that if translated to humans\\n\\nwould be about double the human therapeutic dose.\\n\\nSo that is something that we need to take into consideration.\\n\\nNonetheless, it's very clear\\n\\nthat in both animal studies and humans,\\n\\npsilocybin is inducing both structural\\n\\nand functional changes in brain circuitry\\n\\nand that in humans,\\n\\nthe network connectivity is being changed dramatically.\\n\\nWe talked about those data earlier\\n\\nand that the underlying basis for that might be,\\n\\nagain, might be, we don't know for sure,\\n\\nthe addition of new dendritic spines\\n\\non these pyramidal neurons that we've been talking about\\n\\nrepeatedly throughout today's episode,\\n\\nalthough neurogenesis perhaps\\n\\nand other modes of neuroplasticity\\n\\nsuch as the elimination of certain connections,\\n\\nperhaps related to unhealthy maladaptive thoughts\\n\\nor our feeling that a particular sad song\\n\\nis overwhelmingly sad.\\n\\nIt could be the case that those sorts of things\\n\\nchange subjectively\\n\\nbecause of the removal of neural connections.\\n\\nIf you're going to think like a neurobiologist\\n\\nor scientist for that matter,\\n\\nyou don't ever want to think that one mechanism\\n\\ncan explain all the effects of a given drug\\n\\nor a given experience.\\n\\nIt's almost certainly likely to be the consequence\\n\\nof multiple mechanisms acting in parallel.\\n\\nAnd because I know there are people out there\\n\\nwho would like to know even more\\n\\nabout the neuroplasticity induced by psychedelics,\\n\\nincluding psilocybin,\\n\\nthere's a wonderful review that I provide a link to\\n\\nin the show note captions entitled,\\n\\nPsychedelics and Neuroplasticity,\\n\\na systematic review unraveling\\n\\nthe biological underpinnings of psychedelics.\\n\\nThis review is great because it goes a step beyond\\n\\njust psilocybin, psilocin binding\\n\\nto the serotonin 2A receptor\\n\\nand things like brain derived in a trophic factor.\\n\\nIt actually talks a lot about the intracellular signaling\\n\\nand exactly how neurons change their excitability patterns\\n\\nbased on this activation of the serotonin 2A receptor.\\n\\nIt's probably more detailed than most of you out there\\n\\nare interested in,\\n\\nbut if you are interested in that level of detail,\\n\\nthis is a wonderful open access review.\\n\\nSo a few minutes ago,\\n\\nI talked about where there is strong, modest\\n\\nand somewhat weak or rather I should say,\\n\\nminimal evidence for the therapeutic use of psilocybin\\n\\nto treat various disorders.\\n\\nAnd across the board,\\n\\nit really appears that major depression\\n\\nand so-called intractable depression in some cases\\n\\nis where we're seeing the most exciting research to date.\\n\\nNow keep in mind that because of the Controlled Substances Act\\n\\nbeing invoked in 1970 in the United States\\n\\nand because it was only just a few years ago really,\\n\\nonly about five years ago that psychedelics\\n\\nincluding psilocybin received\\n\\nwhat's called breakthrough status at the FDA\\n\\nthat there are now a lot of clinical trials\\n\\nexploring how psilocybin can impact various things\\n\\nlike mood disorders, addictive disorders and so on.\\n\\nPrior to 2018 when that therapeutic breakthrough potential\\n\\nwas established in the United States,\\n\\nI think a lot of people\\n\\nin the so-called psychedelics community had the sense\\n\\nand really the belief\\n\\nthat these drugs had enormous potential\\n\\nbut they just weren't being explored that extensively.\\n\\nSo I do want to give a nod to the incredible researchers\\n\\nsuch as Robin Cardart-Harris\\n\\nbut also Matthew Johnson, Roland Griffiths,\\n\\nNolan Williams and many others.\\n\\nOkay, I'm certainly not listing off everybody\\n\\nthat would take hours\\n\\nbut those researchers have really pioneered\\n\\nboth the legal efforts and the funding efforts\\n\\nand most importantly the research efforts\\n\\ndefining the clinical data that I'm about to describe.\\n\\nAnd here I'm going to summarize the clinical data\\n\\nin a bit of a top contour fashion,\\n\\njust giving you the kind of highlights.\\n\\nWe will of course provide links to the papers\\n\\nif you'd like to look into it further\\n\\nbut I'm only giving you the top contour\\n\\nbecause I've had the great fortune\\n\\nof having Matthew Johnson on this podcast before.\\n\\nYou can find that episode at hubermanlab.com.\\n\\nJust simply put Matt's name or psychedelics\\n\\ninto the search function.\\n\\nIt'll take you to that episode in all formats\\n\\nor links to all formats rather.\\n\\nI've also had the great fortune of sitting down recently\\n\\nwith Dr. Robin Cardart-Harris\\n\\nto talk about his work\\n\\nat University of California, San Francisco\\n\\non psilocybin, LSD, ayahuasca and DMT\\n\\nas it relates to depression and other disorders.\\n\\nAnd that episode which also will be released\\n\\nat hubermanlab.com and on all platforms,\\n\\nYouTube, Apple, Spotify,\\n\\nreally goes in depth into these clinical studies\\n\\nand what those studies really look like.\\n\\nWho's in the room?\\n\\nWhether or not people just get one dose or two doses,\\n\\nhow far apart those are separated,\\n\\nall of that is covered in extensive detail\\n\\nin that what I found to be wonderful discussion\\n\\nwith Dr. Robin Cardart-Harris.\\n\\nSo if you're interested in all of the details\\n\\nas it relates to clinical application of psychedelics,\\n\\nstay tuned for that episode soon.\\n\\nAgain, you can find that at hubermanlab.com\\n\\nand on all platforms.\\n\\nIn the meantime, I would be remiss\\n\\nif I didn't include a bit of discussion\\n\\nabout what has been observed\\n\\nin terms of using psilocybin journeys\\n\\nas a way to treat depression\\n\\nbecause the data are just, oh, so exciting.\\n\\nAgain, these data really started to surface\\n\\nas the consequence of studies\\n\\nthat were initiated around 2006\\n\\nin just a few select laboratories\\n\\nand then really picked up in terms of the number\\n\\nof laboratories and number of studies between 2018 and now.\\n\\nSo what you'll notice is that most of the papers\\n\\nI'm about to describe were published\\n\\nin, for instance, phenomenal journals,\\n\\nNew England Journal of Medicine in 2021,\\n\\nNew England Journal of Medicine, November, 2022,\\n\\nJournal of the American Medical Association Psychiatry\\n\\njust very recently, 2021.\\n\\nSo these are very recent papers.\\n\\nEssentially, all of these clinical studies\\n\\ninvolve either one or two psilocybin sessions.\\n\\nThe dosages that were explored\\n\\nrange from zero milligrams, placebo, if you will,\\n\\n10 milligrams, in some cases, 25 milligrams,\\n\\nin some cases, 30 milligrams.\\n\\nAnd most typically people receive the same dosage\\n\\nfor both sessions if indeed they did both sessions.\\n\\nHowever, there's at least one study\\n\\nlooking at just one single episode\\n\\nof psilocybin administration.\\n\\nSo this is the paper entitled, no surprise,\\n\\nsingle dose psilocybin for treatment resistant episode\\n\\nof major depression.\\n\\nThis was published in the New England Journal of Medicine\\n\\nin November of 2022.\\n\\nI'll just summarize the results\\n\\nof this single application study.\\n\\nThey randomly assigned subjects\\n\\nwho had treatment resistant depression.\\n\\nSo they'd resisted treatment to other things\\n\\nto receive a single dose\\n\\nof a synthetic formulation of psilocybin.\\n\\nSo they're not eating mushrooms,\\n\\nthey're getting a synthetic dose of psilocybin,\\n\\nbut the dose is known of either 25 milligrams,\\n\\n10 milligrams, or one milligram, which was the control.\\n\\nAnd they receive psychological support.\\n\\nThere were a number of different tests,\\n\\nsubjective tests of depression taken before\\n\\nand after the psilocybin journey.\\n\\nThey had about 75 to 79 participants in each group,\\n\\nagain, at the three different doses,\\n\\n25, 10, or one milligram.\\n\\nAnd they looked at the changes in these scores,\\n\\nthese depression related scores on these tests.\\n\\nThere are many results from this paper,\\n\\none could summarize, but among the most important results,\\n\\nI can summarize from the discussion,\\n\\nand here I'm paraphrasing that the change\\n\\nin baseline levels of depression, that is,\\n\\nat week three, following the psilocybin session,\\n\\nwas significantly better.\\n\\nThat is, people experienced more relief\\n\\nor more people experienced more relief\\n\\nfrom the 25 milligram dose than from the one milligram dose.\\n\\nAnd this is important, there was no significant difference\\n\\nbetween the 10 milligram dose and the one milligram dose.\\n\\nThis really points to the fact that the 25 to 30 milligram dose\\n\\nthat's used in the largest numbers of studies\\n\\nexploring treatment-resistant depression\\n\\nreally seems to be, I don't want to say the best dose,\\n\\nbut the most effective dose,\\n\\nat least in this clinical context,\\n\\nin this set and setting,\\n\\nand with this particular patient population.\\n\\nSo we want to be careful to say that\\n\\nso that one doesn't just translate\\n\\nthat 25 milligrams is better than 10 milligrams,\\n\\nalthough in this study it was\\n\\nfor sake of treatment-resistant depression relief.\\n\\nThere were a number of other key aspects of this paper,\\n\\nin particular, the exploration of so-called adverse events,\\n\\nso things like headaches, propensity for self-harm,\\n\\nactual self-harm, anxiety, and so on.\\n\\nIt's worth mentioning that there were adverse events\\n\\nin essentially every group.\\n\\nThe number of adverse events was highest\\n\\nin the 25 milligram dose group,\\n\\nand this is observed in other studies as well.\\n\\nWith higher dosages, there tends to be greater relief\\n\\nfrom depressive symptoms,\\n\\nbut also a greater chance for adverse events.\\n\\nSome of those adverse events can be quite severe,\\n\\nso feelings of suicidal ideation, et cetera.\\n\\nSome of them one could consider a little less severe,\\n\\nmild headache, or severe headache that was transient,\\n\\nor anxiety that was transient.\\n\\nAgain, highly individual responses.\\n\\nWe could go line by line and table by table\\n\\nthrough this paper, which we won't,\\n\\nbecause there's a lot of data.\\n\\nAgain, we'll provide a link to this paper\\n\\nif you'd like to peruse it yourself.\\n\\nIt's fairly straightforward to read.\\n\\nThat's one thing that's nice about these clinical trials\\n\\nis they tend to be written in fairly non-technical language,\\n\\nalthough there's a little bit of technical language.\\n\\nThe important point is that a single dose\\n\\nof 25 milligrams of psilocybin provided significant relief\\n\\nfrom treatment-resistant depression\\n\\nin this particular patient population,\\n\\nbut it is not the case that 100% of the people\\n\\nwho took 25 milligrams of psilocybin\\n\\nexperienced that relief.\\n\\nHowever, the majority of them did.\\n\\nNow, when you say majority in science,\\n\\nyou really need to look to numbers.\\n\\nAnd the reason I'm not telling you,\\n\\noh, it was 75% or 60% or 50% is because it depends\\n\\non which time point people were analyzed.\\n\\nPeople were asked about their level of depression relief\\n\\nimmediately after, one week after, two weeks after,\\n\\nor three weeks after.\\n\\nAnd the degree of relief tended to change over time.\\n\\nIn fact, it tended to diminish over time,\\n\\nbut it was also stable, or remarkably stable, I should say,\\n\\nat least by my read, in the 25 milligram dose group.\\n\\nAnd that is summarized nicely in figure two of the paper\\n\\nbecause they explored these people's levels of depression\\n\\nout to week 12, and they still saw a significant degree\\n\\nof depression relief 12 weeks\\n\\nafter the single 25 milligram psilocybin dose session.\\n\\nSo as I mentioned earlier,\\n\\nthere are now about a dozen or so excellent studies,\\n\\nclinical trials, exploring the use of single\\n\\nor two-session psilocybin treatment\\n\\nin that 25 to 30 milligram range,\\n\\nwhich seems to be the most effective dose\\n\\nfor long-lasting relief from depression.\\n\\nEach one of those studies explored something different,\\n\\nas is important.\\n\\nReplication is also important, of course,\\n\\nin order to validate previous studies.\\n\\nBut for instance, there have been comparisons\\n\\nof psilocybin versus SSRIs or other antidepressants.\\n\\nThere have been comparisons of psilocybin\\n\\nplus psychoanalysis or cognitive behavioral therapy\\n\\nversus cognitive behavioral therapy alone\\n\\nor psychoanalysis alone.\\n\\nAnd so there's a lot of evaluation now\\n\\nof the clinical outcomes and the statistical outcomes\\n\\nof these subjective measures,\\n\\nand even some objective measures of neurochemistry\\n\\nwhere that's possible in terms of trying to understand\\n\\nif and how psilocybin is effective\\n\\nfor the treatment of depression.\\n\\nAnd the major takeaway is that, indeed,\\n\\nit does seem to be the case.\\n\\nAnd the numbers that I feel comfortable\\n\\nnot throwing out there but putting out to you\\n\\nreflect my conversation with Robin Cardhart-Harris.\\n\\nAgain, that will be released soon at hubermanlab.com,\\n\\nas well as takeaways from what I would say\\n\\nare the six broadest studies,\\n\\nmeaning they have the widest range of age groups,\\n\\nthe broadest demographic in terms of the subjects,\\n\\ntheir backgrounds, their levels of education,\\n\\nmen, women, ethnicity, et cetera.\\n\\nAnd a lot of that can be summarized\\n\\nin the paper entitled\\n\\nEffects of Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy\\n\\non Major Depressive Disorder.\\n\\nThis was a particular randomized clinical trial.\\n\\nBut in the discussion, I think they summarize it quite well,\\n\\nwhich is that if you look at the number of people\\n\\nwho take this 25-milligram dose twice\\n\\nin sessions spaced about a week apart,\\n\\nwhat you will find is that anywhere from 60 to 75%\\n\\nof the people who have major depressive disorder,\\n\\nwho do these psilocybin sessions in the proper setting,\\n\\nreport a good experience with it,\\n\\nhave minimal adverse events coming out of those sessions\\n\\nand in the weeks following,\\n\\nthose people experience substantial positive relief\\n\\nfrom major depression in ways that other treatments\\n\\nthat they had explored, including antidepressant drugs,\\n\\ncognitive behavioral therapy,\\n\\nand other types of therapy alone could not provide.\\n\\nNow, it's a general feature of these clinical trials\\n\\nfocusing on psilocybin that people are asked\\n\\nto stop taking their antidepressants\\n\\nprior to participating in the trial.\\n\\nIt's also a general feature of these trials\\n\\nthat people are encouraged to not suddenly\\n\\nstart their antidepressant treatment immediately afterwards,\\n\\nbecause of course that could confound the results\\n\\nof the psilocybin treatment.\\n\\nAnd this is a very important thing to note,\\n\\nall subjects were encouraged\\n\\nnot to avoid taking those antidepressant medications\\n\\nif in fact their clinician felt that it was important\\n\\nfor their immediate and long-term survival.\\n\\nSo, no one should be reckless in thinking about\\n\\nwhat to add or delete from their drug protocol\\n\\nwhen dealing with depression, right?\\n\\nThe outcomes could be very severe in that case.\\n\\nNonetheless, we can paraphrase from the discussion\\n\\nof the paper I just mentioned,\\n\\nbecause it really highlights the incredible results\\n\\nthat psilocybin applied in these particular\\n\\ntherapeutic settings are providing.\\n\\nAnd here again, I'm paraphrasing.\\n\\nThe present trial showed that psilocybin administered\\n\\nin the context of supportive psychotherapy,\\n\\nconsisting of approximately 11 hours of psychotherapy.\\n\\nSo this is going to be two sessions of the psilocybin\\n\\nwith proper therapeutic support,\\n\\nproduced large rapid and sustained antidepressant effects.\\n\\nThe effect sizes reported in the study\\n\\nwere approximately 2.5 times greater\\n\\nthan the effects sizes found in psychotherapy,\\n\\nand more than four times greater than the effect sizes\\n\\nfound in psychopharmacologic depression treatment studies.\\n\\nIn other words, four times the positive effect\\n\\nobserved with typical SSRIs\\n\\nor other pharmacology of that sort.\\n\\nThese findings are consistent with the literature\\n\\nthat showed that combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy\\n\\nwere more efficacious in the treatment\\n\\nof major depressive disorder than either intervention alone.\\n\\nSo again, this points to the fact\\n\\nthat combining drug therapy with talk therapy,\\n\\nas it's often called, is going to be more effective\\n\\nthan either treatment alone.\\n\\nHere the drug therapy is psilocybin therapy.\\n\\nAnd again, please don't take the fact that in these studies\\n\\nthey tended to ask people to not take\\n\\ntheir antidepressant medication heading into the study\\n\\nas a sign that one should stop taking\\n\\ntheir antidepressant medication.\\n\\nRather, I think this study and other studies like it,\\n\\nagain, which we'll provide links to\\n\\nin the show note captions that are discussed extensively\\n\\nin the episode with Dr. Cardart-Harris soon to come,\\n\\nreally point to the incredible role\\n\\nthat psilocybin can have in creating an experience\\n\\ninside of the session, the journey or the trip,\\n\\nas it's called, as well as initiating neuroplastic events,\\n\\nperhaps the addition of dendritic spines,\\n\\nmaybe even some new neurons, maybe,\\n\\nalthough I don't think that's the predominant mode.\\n\\nBut that leads to these more extensive connectivities\\n\\nin the brain, the so-called reduction in modular networks,\\n\\nenhanced activity in brain areas\\n\\nthat normally wouldn't be talking to one another,\\n\\nbut not doing that in any kind of haphazard way.\\n\\nIt really does seem that the one or two sessions\\n\\nof psilocybin that induce these feelings of ego dissolution,\\n\\nthat induce these feelings of oceanic boundlessness, right?\\n\\nSo mystical, right?\\n\\nAnd in many ways it's what I find so incredible\\n\\nabout psilocybin and other psychedelics\\n\\nis that despite the highly mystical, highly subjective,\\n\\nand still at this time, somewhat top contour understanding\\n\\nof how they might exert their effects,\\n\\nyou can highlight boldface and underline might there, right?\\n\\nBecause it hasn't really been firmly established\\n\\nwhat the exact cell biological rewiring events are.\\n\\nBut there is now what I would refer to\\n\\nas a center of mass of data\\n\\nthat point to the fact that psilocybin,\\n\\nwhen taken in the appropriate set and setting,\\n\\nat the appropriate dosages,\\n\\ncan invoke the sorts of neuroplasticity\\n\\nand changes in emotionality, in perceptual experience,\\n\\nnot just during the psychedelic session,\\n\\nbut for long periods of time after the psychedelic session\\n\\nthat can provide really remarkable relief\\n\\nfrom things like major depression\\n\\nand perhaps other psychiatric issues as well.\\n\\nAnd of course, I realize that many of you are listening to\\n\\nand are watching this episode\\n\\nand you're not necessarily depressed\\n\\nor thinking about psychedelics like psilocybin\\n\\nin the context of depression.\\n\\nI hope today's discussion allowed you to better understand\\n\\nhow psychedelics and psilocybin in particular,\\n\\nbecause that's what we've been talking about,\\n\\nare able to exert these incredible effects\\n\\nthat they seem to exert.\\n\\nThis is not a call for everyone to run out and do psilocybin.\\n\\nIt is absolutely not that.\\n\\nIt is, however, my attempt to really put a magnifying lens\\n\\non this incredible area of research that's happening,\\n\\nnot just in the context of clinical trials,\\n\\nbut in the context of trying to understand\\n\\nhow serotonin and how drugs like psilocybin,\\n\\nwhich in many ways mimic serotonin,\\n\\nand more particularly the activation\\n\\nof particular receptors in the brain,\\n\\nlike the serotonin 2A receptor.\\n\\nI mean, just sit back and think about that.\\n\\nThe selective activation of this receptor,\\n\\nwhich is, by the way,\\n\\nassociated with the expansion\\n\\nof the neocortex across evolution,\\n\\ndidn't mention that before, but indeed it is,\\n\\nhow that can lead to enhanced ways of thinking,\\n\\nchanged ways of thinking, actual learning\\n\\ninside of this short four-hour or six-hour session\\n\\nthat we call the psilocybin journey.\\n\\nSo as is often the case, perhaps as is always the case\\n\\nhere on the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\n\\nwe did a deep dive into a topic today\\n\\ninto the topic of psilocybin, what it is, how it works,\\n\\nthe different ways in which it changes brain circuitry,\\n\\nhow it creates the experiences that we think of\\n\\nas the psilocybin journey, what the safety issues are,\\n\\nwhat the so-called set and setting are\\n\\nthat can lend themselves to positive therapeutic outcomes.\\n\\nAnd in doing so,\\n\\nmy goal was really to highlight several things.\\n\\nFirst of all, I am very excited about the potential\\n\\nfor psychedelics such as psilocybin\\n\\nto provide relief for mental health issues\\n\\nthat to date have been very hard for people to access.\\n\\nIn addition to that,\\n\\nI'm just fundamentally interested in the brain\\n\\nand how it works and how it can change\\n\\nthis thing we call neuroplasticity.\\n\\nTo me, neuroplasticity is the holy grail\\n\\nof the human nervous system.\\n\\nAs far as we know, we are the animal\\n\\nthat can have long lasting neuroplasticity\\n\\nthroughout the lifespan.\\n\\nAnd if it requires the use of compounds\\n\\nin a safe and controlled way, such as psilocybin,\\n\\nin order to achieve maximal plasticity\\n\\nin a short amount of time, that's exciting.\\n\\nBut of course, that also needs to be considered\\n\\nwith all of the safety precautions in mind\\n\\nthat we talked about earlier,\\n\\nincluding the fact that people who have a predisposition\\n\\nor who have psychosis or bipolar disorder\\n\\nor a relative that has psychosis or bipolar disorder,\\n\\nyounger people, meaning people 25 years of age and younger,\\n\\nand really anyone who's not working with a dedicated\\n\\nand highly trained physician\\n\\nneeds to be very cautious about these compounds as well.\\n\\nThey're very exciting.\\n\\nI think psilocybin is an exciting\\n\\nand super interesting compound\\n\\nfor basic and clinical reasons\\n\\nand for other reasons as well.\\n\\nBut they are sharp blades, as we say.\\n\\nAnd with sharp blades, you can do incredible things,\\n\\nbut you can also cut yourself very badly.\\n\\nSo all those considerations need to be taken to mind.\\n\\nSo I consider the science and use of psilocybin\\n\\nto be an exciting, but still preliminary area\\n\\nthat I certainly am paying a lot of attention to,\\n\\nand I know there's a lot of excitement about.\\n\\nSo stay tuned for the episode\\n\\nwith Dr. Robin Cardart-Harris,\\n\\nand we will probably revisit psilocybin,\\n\\nand we will certainly revisit the other psychedelics\\n\\nand non-classical psychedelics,\\n\\nincluding LSD, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, ketamine, MDMA, mescaline,\\n\\nand all the rest in future episodes as well.\\n\\nIf you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast,\\n\\nplease subscribe to our YouTube channel.\\n\\nThat's the best, zero-cost way to support us.\\n\\nIn addition,

       " Document(page_content=\"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\n\\nwhere we discuss science\\n\\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\\n\\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\\n\\nand I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology\\n\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\n\\nToday, we are discussing breathing.\\n\\nNow, breathing is something that we are all familiar with\\n\\nbecause, frankly, we are all doing it right now,\\n\\nand we do it during our waking states\\n\\nand while we are asleep.\\n\\nAnd most of us have probably heard\\n\\nthat breathing is essential to life.\\n\\nWe hear that we can survive without food\\n\\nfor some period of time,\\n\\nmaybe even up to a month or more,\\n\\nthat we can't survive that long without water,\\n\\nbut we could survive a few days without water,\\n\\ndepending on how well hydrated we are\\n\\nwhen we go into that water deprivation\\n\\nand the heat of the environment we happen to be in,\\n\\nbut that we cannot survive without breathing\\n\\nfor more than a few minutes,\\n\\nand that if we cease to breathe,\\n\\nthat our brain and our bodily tissues will die.\\n\\nAnd in fact, that is true.\\n\\nHowever, despite everybody's knowledge\\n\\nthat breathing is essential to life,\\n\\nI don't think that most people realize\\n\\njust how important how we breathe is\\n\\nto our quality of life,\\n\\nand that includes our mental health,\\n\\nour physical health, and what we call performance.\\n\\nThat is our ability to tap into skills,\\n\\neither physical or cognitive,\\n\\nin ways that we would not be able to otherwise\\n\\nif we are not breathing correctly.\\n\\nSo today we are going to talk about\\n\\nwhat it is to breathe correctly,\\n\\nboth at rest, during sleep,\\n\\nin order to reduce our levels of stress,\\n\\nin order to wake up or to become more alert deliberately,\\n\\nand many, many other things,\\n\\nincluding how to stop hiccuping.\\n\\nThis is one of the most searched for topics on the internet.\\n\\nToday I will teach you the one method\\n\\nthat is actually linked to science.\\n\\nNo, it does not involve drinking a glass of water\\n\\nbackwards from the opposite side of the cup\\n\\nor holding your breath in any kind of esoteric way.\\n\\nIt actually relates to the neural mechanisms,\\n\\nthat is the brain to body connections that cause the hiccup.\\n\\nHiccup is a spasm of that neural circuit,\\n\\nand I'll teach you how to turn off\\n\\nthat neural circuit in one try.\\n\\nAnd that's not a technique I developed.\\n\\nIt's a technique that's actually been known about\\n\\nfor several centuries,\\n\\nand we now know the underlying mechanism.\\n\\nSo today's discussion will give to you many tools\\n\\nthat you can apply.\\n\\nAll of these tools are, of course, behavioral tools.\\n\\nThey're completely zero cost.\\n\\nAnd in telling you how those tools work,\\n\\nyou'll learn a lot about how the breathing,\\n\\nAKA the respiratory system, works\\n\\nand how it interfaces with the other organs\\n\\nand tissues of the body, in particular, the brain.\\n\\nIn fact, one of the most important things\\n\\nto understand about breathing right here at the outset\\n\\nis that breathing is unique among brain\\n\\nand bodily functions,\\n\\nin that it lies at the interface between our conscious\\n\\nand our subconscious behavior,\\n\\nand it represents a bridge, literally, in the brain\\n\\nbetween the conscious and the subconscious.\\n\\nWhat do I mean by that?\\n\\nWell, breathing does not require\\n\\nthat we pay attention to our breathing\\n\\nor that we are even aware that we are breathing.\\n\\nIt will just carry on in the background,\\n\\neither normally or abnormally,\\n\\nand I'll teach you what normal\\n\\nand abnormal breathing is in a little bit.\\n\\nHowever, breathing is unique among brain\\n\\nand bodily functions in that at any moment,\\n\\nwe can consciously take control of how we breathe.\\n\\nThis is an absolutely spectacular\\n\\nand highly unusual feature of brain function.\\n\\nFor instance, your digestion is carrying on\\n\\nin the background right now,\\n\\nwhether or not you've had food recently or not,\\n\\nbut you can't simply control your digestion\\n\\nby thinking about it in a particular way.\\n\\nIn fact, most people can't even control their thinking\\n\\nby trying to control their thinking.\\n\\nThat actually takes some practice.\\n\\nIt can be done, a topic for a future episode.\\n\\nHowever, breathing is unique.\\n\\nBreathing will carry on involuntarily, subconsciously\\n\\nin the background, as I said before,\\n\\nbut if at any moment you want to hold your breath\\n\\nor inhale more deeply or vigorously\\n\\nor exhale longer than you inhale, you can do that.\\n\\nVery few, if any other neural circuits in your brain\\n\\nand body allow that level of control.\\n\\nAnd it turns out that level of control is not an accident.\\n\\nIt has been hypothesized that by controlling breathing,\\n\\nthe brain is actually attempting to control\\n\\nits own state of mind.\\n\\nNow, the way this was originally stated\\n\\nin a scientific research paper was a little bit different.\\n\\nIt was a little bit more physiological.\\n\\nThe statement was the brain by regulating breathing\\n\\ncontrols its own excitability.\\n\\nExcitability in the context of neurobiology\\n\\nis how able the brain is to take in new information or not,\\n\\nhow able the brain is or not to turn itself off,\\n\\nto go to sleep, and to regulate its own levels\\n\\nof anxiety, focus, et cetera.\\n\\nIf that seems a little bit abstract,\\n\\nI'll make it simple for you.\\n\\nBy changing your pattern of breathing,\\n\\nyou can very quickly change\\n\\nwhat your brain is capable of doing.\\n\\nIn fact, a little bit later,\\n\\nI'll tell you that while you inhale,\\n\\nyou are far better at learning\\n\\nand remembering information than during an exhale.\\n\\nAnd it is a very significant difference.\\n\\nDoes that mean you should only inhale and not exhale?\\n\\nNo, of course not.\\n\\nI'll teach you how to breathe\\n\\nfor the sake of learning and memory,\\n\\nas well as for physical performance\\n\\nand a number of other things.\\n\\nSo hopefully I've been able to highlight for you\\n\\nthe importance of breathing, not just for life,\\n\\nbecause yes, breathing is essential for life,\\n\\nbut that the subtleties of how we breathe,\\n\\nthe duration and intensity of our inhales and our exhales,\\n\\nhow long we hold our breath between inhales and exhales,\\n\\nvery critically defines our state of mind\\n\\nand our state of body, what we are able to do\\n\\nand what we are not able to do.\\n\\nAnd the great news is we can control our breathing,\\n\\nand in doing so, control our mental health,\\n\\nphysical health, and performance.\\n\\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\\n\\nthat this podcast is separate\\n\\nfrom my teaching and research roles at Stanford.\\n\\nIt is, however, part of my desire and effort\\n\\nto bring zero cost to consumer information about science\\n\\nand science-related tools to the general public.\\n\\nIn keeping with that theme,\\n\\nI'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.\\n\\nOur first sponsor is HVMN.\\n\\nHVMN, which is a supplement that increases ketones,\\n\\ncan be used in the context of a ketogenic diet.\\n\\nHowever, many people, including myself,\\n\\nfind that increasing blood ketones\\n\\nby using a supplement such as HVMN\\n\\ncan greatly improve cognitive ability and physical output\\n\\nfor mental work and for exercise,\\n\\neven when not on a ketogenic diet.\\n\\nThere's a lot of research supporting the fact\\n\\nthat even if you are consuming carbohydrates\\n\\nand you are not in ketosis,\\n\\nthat is you are not following a ketogenic diet,\\n\\nconsuming supplements that can increase blood ketones\\n\\ncan allow you to think more clearly for cognitive work\\n\\nand physical work for that matter,\\n\\nperform at greater output for things like\\n\\nresistance training and endurance exercise.\\n\\nAnd indeed, that's what I've found.\\n\\nSo I use it largely for preparing for podcasts\\n\\nor other aspects of my scientific work.\\n\\nAnd sometimes prior to workouts,\\n\\nespecially if I'm working out\\n\\nhaving not consumed any food prior,\\n\\nI find that I have a lot more energy.\\n\\nIt also has the property of suppressing hunger.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try ketone IQ,\\n\\nyou can go to hvmn.com slash Huberman to save 20%.\\n\\nAgain, that's hvmn.com slash Huberman\\n\\nto save 20% off your order of ketone IQ.\\n\\nToday's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.\\n\\nThesis makes custom nootropics.\\n\\nAnd as many of you have probably heard me say before,\\n\\nI am not a fan of the word nootropics\\n\\nbecause nootropics means smart drugs.\\n\\nAnd frankly, the brain doesn't work that way.\\n\\nThe brain has neural circuits for focus.\\n\\nIt also has neural circuits for creativity\\n\\nand neural circuits for task switching\\n\\nand for imagination and for memory.\\n\\nThere is no such thing as a neural circuit for being smart.\\n\\nAnd therefore the word nootropics\\n\\ndoesn't really apply to anything specific\\n\\nneurobiologically speaking.\\n\\nThesis understands this\\n\\nand therefore has designed custom nootropics\\n\\nthat are tailored to your unique needs.\\n\\nI've been using Thesis for over a year now\\n\\nand their nootropic formulas have been a game changer for me\\n\\nin particular in the realm of cognitive work.\\n\\nMy go-to formula for when I'm doing any kind of cognitive\\n\\nwork is their clarity formula.\\n\\nThat's the one I've been using most often lately.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try Thesis customized nootropics,\\n\\nyou can go online to take thesis.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nYou'll take a brief three minute quiz\\n\\nand Thesis will

feedback\\n\\non how to adjust your training\\n\\nand sleep schedule to perform better.\\n\\nI've been working with Whoop\\n\\non their scientific advisory council\\n\\nto help Whoop evolve their mission\\n\\nto improve the way that people are sleeping\\n\\nand thereby to improve their levels of focus,\\n\\nmood and alertness and performance\\n\\nin all endeavors during the day.\\n\\nAs a Whoop user, I've experienced the health benefits,\\n\\nthe focus benefits,\\n\\nessentially all of the major benefits\\n\\nthat come with getting an excellent night's sleep\\n\\non a consistent basis.\\n\\nI've also learned from using my Whoop\\n\\nhow certain daily activities like the timing of exercise,\\n\\ncaffeine and a number of other things\\n\\nimpact the depth, quality and duration of my sleep.\\n\\nWhoop is one of those tools that can really help guide you\\n\\nand provide you with personalized data, recommendations\\n\\nand coaching around your body and your overall health.\\n\\nSo it's not just about tracking sleep,\\n\\nit's about tracking all aspects of your activity and health\\n\\nand of course, including sleep.\\n\\nIf you're interested in trying Whoop,\\n\\nyou can go to join.whoop.com slash Huberman today\\n\\nand get your first month free.\\n\\nLet's talk about breathing.\\n\\nAnd of course we breathe in order to bring oxygen\\n\\ninto the body, but we also breathe to remove certain things\\n\\nfrom our body in particular, carbon dioxide.\\n\\nSo the main players in today's discussion\\n\\nare going to be oxygen and carbon dioxide.\\n\\nNow a common misconception is that oxygen is good\\n\\nand carbon dioxide is bad.\\n\\nThat's simply not the case.\\n\\nLet's just take a step back from that statement\\n\\nand let's think about this.\\n\\nWhen we breathe in, we are largely breathing in air\\n\\nin order to bring oxygen into our body.\\n\\nAnd we can just stop right there and say,\\n\\nwhy do we breathe at all?\\n\\nWhy can't we just get oxygen from the world around us?\\n\\nWell, it's because oxygen can't diffuse through our skin\\n\\ninto the deeper cells of our body.\\n\\nOther single cell and very simple organisms\\n\\ncan actually bring oxygen into their system\\n\\nwithout the need to breathe.\\n\\nBut we have to breathe in order to bring oxygen\\n\\nto the cells that reside deep in our body.\\n\\nIn particular, our brain cells,\\n\\nwhich are the most metabolically active cells in our body\\n\\nrequire a lot of oxygen.\\n\\nAnd those brain cells are sitting of course in the brain,\\n\\nwhich is encased in the cranial vault, the skull.\\n\\nAnd so oxygen's can't simply pass to those cells.\\n\\nSo we need to have a system\\n\\nthat will deliver oxygen to those cells.\\n\\nWe also need a system,\\n\\nwhich turns out to be the breathing or respiratory system\\n\\nthat can offload or remove the gas\\n\\nthat we call carbon dioxide.\\n\\nNot because carbon dioxide is bad,\\n\\nbut because too much of it in our system is not good.\\n\\nIn fact, much of today's discussion\\n\\nwill also center around the common misconception\\n\\nthat carbon dioxide is something that we want to get rid of.\\n\\nYou don't want to get rid of too much carbon dioxide\\n\\nor else you can't actually get oxygen\\n\\nto the cells and tissues of your body in an efficient way.\\n\\nSo you need oxygen and you need carbon dioxide\\n\\nin your body.\\n\\nYou also need to be able to offload or remove carbon dioxide\\n\\nand bring in oxygen in the correct ratios\\n\\nso that you can perform the kind of mental functions\\n\\nand physical functions that you want to.\\n\\nSo if we just dial out even further,\\n\\nwe say, what are the key components of breathing?\\n\\nWhat are the elements within the body\\n\\nthat allow us to bring oxygen to the tissues and cells\\n\\nas is required and remove carbon dioxide\\n\\nfrom the body as is required\\n\\nand yet keep enough carbon dioxide around\\n\\nin order to allow oxygen to do its thing?\\n\\nWell, that breathing or respiratory apparatus\\n\\nhas two major components\\n\\nand I'm going to just briefly describe those.\\n\\nAnd as I do this, I really want to highlight the fact\\n\\nthat anytime you're thinking about biology\\n\\nand physiology in particular,\\n\\nwhether or not it's about the brain or the liver\\n\\nor the gut microbiome,\\n\\nit's useful to categorize things\\n\\neither as mechanical mechanisms or chemical mechanisms.\\n\\nWhat do I mean by that?\\n\\nWell, let's just take the analogy of hunger.\\n\\nThere are mechanical mechanisms\\n\\nthat tell us when we should eat.\\n\\nFor instance, you have neurons, nerve cells in your gut\\n\\nthat signal how stretched or non-stretched\\n\\nthe walls of your stomach are, right?\\n\\nHow full or how empty your gut is\\n\\nand send that information to the brain\\n\\nto make you feel to some extent hungry or not hungry.\\n\\nIn general, when our stomach is very full,\\n\\nespecially if it's very distended, even with liquid,\\n\\nit suppresses our hunger.\\n\\nWhereas when our stomach is devoid\\n\\nof that mechanical pressure,\\n\\nespecially for a number of hours,\\n\\nit tends to trigger hunger by signaling\\n\\nvia neurons to the brain.\\n\\nIn addition, there are chemical signals\\n\\nthat go from the gut to the brain.\\n\\nFor instance, we have neurons in our gut\\n\\nthat can detect the presence of amino acids\\n\\nfrom proteins that we eat,\\n\\nfatty acids from the foods that we eat, the lipids,\\n\\nand sugars, different forms of carbohydrate.\\n\\nThe neurons in our gut are paying attention to\\n\\nor respond to how much amino acid, fatty acid,\\n\\nand carbohydrate is in our gut\\n\\nand send signals to the brain\\n\\nto either stimulate or suppress hunger.\\n\\nSo those are chemical signals\\n\\nthat are being passed from gut to brain\\n\\nand they work in parallel with the mechanical signals.\\n\\nAnd this idea of in parallel with,\\n\\nagain, is a very common theme in biology,\\n\\nespecially neuroscience.\\n\\nThe term parallel pathways refers to the fact\\n\\nthat anytime there's a critical bodily function,\\n\\nit's very unlikely that just one type of information,\\n\\nlike just mechanical information, is going to be used.\\n\\nAlmost always, it's going to be mechanical\\n\\nand chemical information.\\n\\nI could pick a number of other examples.\\n\\nFor instance, if you want to avoid damaging your skin\\n\\nor other tissues of your body, which is essential to life,\\n\\nwell, then you have mechanical information about,\\n\\nfor instance, whether or not something is pinching\\n\\nor ready to pierce your skin.\\n\\nThat's mechanical information.\\n\\nIt's sent via specific neurons up to the brain\\n\\nto signal a retraction reflex.\\n\\nIf you move your limb away\\n\\nfrom wherever that intense pressure is coming.\\n\\nYou also have chemical sensing in your skin,\\n\\nthe presence of things that elicit a burn\\n\\nor that elicit itch or that elicit extreme cold.\\n\\nAll of that chemical information is being signaled\\n\\nup to the brain as well in parallel.\\n\\nSo parallel pathways is a common theme.\\n\\nSo when we're thinking about the respiration,\\n\\nAKA the breathing system,\\n\\nwe also need to look at the mechanical system.\\n\\nWhat are the different components of the nose,\\n\\nthe mouth, the lungs, et cetera,\\n\\nthat allow oxygen to be brought in\\n\\nand carbon dioxide to be removed from the body,\\n\\nbut not too much carbon dioxide removed\\n\\nto allow breathing to work as efficiently\\n\\nand as optimally as possible.\\n\\nAnd then we also need to look at the chemical systems\\n\\nof the lungs, the bloodstream,\\n\\nand how different cells use oxygen and carbon dioxide\\n\\nin order to understand that as well.\\n\\nIf you can understand the mechanical\\n\\nand chemical aspects of breathing,\\n\\neven just at a top contour,\\n\\nwell, then the various tools that I discussed\\n\\nduring today's episode,\\n\\nsuch as the ability to calm yourself down most quickly\\n\\nby doing what's called a physiological sigh.\\n\\nI'll go into this in more detail in a little bit,\\n\\nbut this is two very deep inhales through the nose.\\n\\nSo the first one is a long inhale.\\n\\nAnd then the second one after that is a quick sharp inhale\\n\\nto maximally inflate your lungs,\\n\\nfollowed by a full exhale through the mouth\\n\\nto lungs completely empty.\\n\\nSo it's big inhale through the nose,\\n\\nthen short inhale through the nose,\\n\\nimmediately after that,\\n\\nin order to maximally inflate the lungs,\\n\\nand then a long exhale through the mouth\\n\\nuntil your lungs are empty.\\n\\nYou will understand why that particular pattern\\n\\nof breathing and not simply one inhale,\\n\\nor not simply an inhale through the nose\\n\\nand an exhale through the nose as well,\\n\\nis optimal for reducing your stress quickly.\\n\\nThat double inhale through the nose,\\n\\nfollowed by a long exhale through the mouth,\\n\\nworks to reduce your levels of stress\\n\\nand lower your levels of so-called autonomic arousal\\n\\nvery fast in real time,\\n\\nand it works better than any other known approach.\\n\\nIt's not a hack.\\n\\nThis is actually something that your body\\n\\nhas specific neural circuits to do,\\n\\nand it actually performs during sleep on a regular basis,\\n\\nand even throughout the day,\\n\\nand that you can perform voluntarily.\\n\\nAnd it works so well to reduce stress very quickly,\\n\\nnot because it brings in the maximum amount of oxygen\\n\\nand removes the maximum amount of carbon dioxide,\\n\\nbut rather because it optimally balances oxygen\\n\\nand carbon dioxide.\\n\\nIf you understand the mechanical\\n\\nand chemical aspects of breathing,\\n\\nthen you will understand exactly why\\n\\nthat particular pattern of breathing,\\n\\nthe so-called physiological psi,\\n\\nis the most efficient way\\n\\nto rapidly reduce stress in real time.\\n\\nIf you can understand the mechanical\\n\\nand chemical aspects of breathing,\\n\\nyou will also understand why most people are over-breathing,\\n\\nthat is, they're breathing too often,\\n\\neven if they're breathing in a shallow manner,\\n\\nthey're breathing too often,\\n\\nand they are blowing off or removing too much carbon dioxide.\\n\\nAnd if you understand that carbon dioxide is critical\\n\\nfor the way that oxygen is delivered from the bloodstream\\n\\nto the tissues of the body, including the brain,\\n\\nwell, then it will make very good sense\\n\\nas to why people who are breathing too much\\n\\ndon't actually experience all the effects\\n\\nof elevated oxygen,\\n\\nbut rather they're putting their body\\n\\ninto what's called a hypoxic state.\\n\\nThey're not getting enough oxygen\\n\\nto the tissues of their body, in particular, their brain.\\n\\nAnd this is true not just for people who are obese\\n\\nor who suffer from sleep apnea,\\n\\nalthough that's certainly the case,\\n\\nbut for people that have, believe it or not,\\n\\ncertain personality types.\\n\\nWe'll talk about breathing and personality type\\n\\nand actually how breathing has been shown\\n\\nto alter personality.\\n\\nThat's right, breathing can alter personality\\n\\nin positive ways that allow anyone\\n\\nto show up to the various social\\n\\nand non-social endeavors of their life\\n\\nwith more calm, more focus, alertness,\\n\\nand improve their overall health.\\n\\nOkay, so let's talk about the mechanical components\\n\\nof breathing.\\n\\nIt's really quite simple.\\n\\nYou've got your nose, obviously,\\n\\nand you've got your mouth.\\n\\nAnd a little bit later, we'll talk\\n\\nabout the incredible advantages\\n\\nof being a nasal breather most of the time,\\n\\nbut also the incredible advantages\\n\\nof using your mouth to breathe,\\n\\nboth for inhales and exhales,\\n\\nduring particular types of endeavors.\\n\\nAnd we'll get back to that a little later.\\n\\nBut for the meantime,\\n\\nthe only two ways to bring air into your system\\n\\nare through your nose and through your mouth.\\n\\nWe also have the larynx,\\n\\nwhich is a rigid tissue or pipe\\n\\nthat brings the air from the nose and mouth\\n\\ndown to the lungs.\\n\\nNow, that word rigid is really important here\\n\\nbecause what we will soon learn\\n\\nis that your lungs basically act like a pump.\\n\\nYou sort of know this already,\\n\\nbut these are two big bags, basically,\\n\\nthat can fill with air or that can squeeze air out.\\n\\nNow, what most people don't realize\\n\\nis that the lungs are not just two big bags of air.\\n\\nYour lungs are actually two big bags of air\\n\\nthat inside of them have hundreds of millions\\n\\nof little sacs that are called the avioli of the lungs.\\n\\nAnd by having those hundreds of millions of little sacs,\\n\\nyou increase the surface area of the lungs.\\n\\nAnd by increasing the surface area,\\n\\nyou allow more oxygen to pass from the air in your lungs\\n\\ninto the bloodstream than if you didn't have those sacs.\\n\\nAnd you allow more carbon dioxide\\n\\nto move from the bloodstream into those sacs of the lungs.\\n\\nAnd then when you exhale, the carbon dioxide can be removed.\\n\\nOkay, so those little sacs we call avioli of the lungs\\n\\nare an important part of the mechanical aspect of breathing.\\n\\nWe'll get to a little bit later.\\n\\nOkay, so at a first pass,\\n\\nthe mechanical aspects of breathing\\n\\nare really straightforward, right?\\n\\nYou can breathe through your nose,\\n\\nyou can breathe through your mouth,\\n\\ngoes down through the larynx.\\n\\nI told you the larynx is a rigid pipe.\\n\\nThe lungs are not rigid.\\n\\nThey can expand and they can contract like a pump\\n\\nto bring in air or to expel air.\\n\\nKeep in mind that the lungs\\n\\ndo not have any muscles themselves.\\n\\nSo we need muscles that can either squeeze the lungs\\n\\nor that will allow the lungs to expand.\\n\\nAnd there are two general groups of muscles that do that.\\n\\nAnd they are the diaphragm\\n\\nand the so-called intercostal muscles.\\n\\nThe diaphragm is a thin muscle\\n\\nthat sits below the lungs and above the liver.\\n\\nAnd when we inhale, provided that we are using\\n\\nwhat's called diaphragmatic breathing,\\n\\nthat diaphragm contracts and when it contracts,\\n\\nit moves down, which allows more space\\n\\nfor the lungs to inflate with air.\\n\\nNow, the intercostal muscles\\n\\nare the muscles between our ribs.\\n\\nA number of people probably don't realize this,\\n\\nbut your ribs, of course, are bone,\\n\\nbut in between those bones, you have muscles.\\n\\nAnd the intercostal muscles, when you inhale, contract,\\n\\nand that allows your rib cage to move up\\n\\nand to expand a bit.\\n\\nAnd I think, again, people probably don't realize\\n\\nthat your ribs are not fixed in place.\\n\\nThey can actually get further\\n\\nand closer apart from one another.\\n\\nSo when you inhale, your rib cage actually moves up.\\n\\nSometimes the shoulders will move up as well.\\n\\nAnd that's because those intercostal muscles\\n\\nare contracting.\\n\\nNow, muscles can't move on their own.\\n\\nThey are controlled by nerves.\\n\\nWe've got the nose, the mouth, the larynx, and the lungs.\\n\\nThe lungs have all those little avioli in them.\\n\\nAnd as I told you, we've got the diaphragm\\n\\nas a muscle to move the lungs,\\n\\nand we have the intercostal muscles to move the ribs,\\n\\nwhich can allow the lungs to expand.\\n\\nAgain, we're just on the mechanical components of breathing.\\n\\nBut because muscles can't move themselves,\\n\\nyou should be asking what moves the muscles.\\n\\nAnd it's really nerves that control muscles.\\n\\nSo whether or not you're contracting your biceps\\n\\nor you're walking and you're contracting your quadriceps\\n\\nand your hamstrings and your calf muscles,\\n\\nit's neurons, nerve cells, that control that.\\n\\nThere's a specialized nerve called the phrenic nerve,\\n\\nP-H-R-E-N-I-C, phrenic nerve,\\n\\nthat comes out of the neck.\\n\\nAnd when I say it comes out of the neck,\\n\\nwhat I mean is that they're little neurons\\n\\nthat reside in the brainstem, in the back of your brain,\\n\\nand they send little wires that we call axons\\n\\ndown and out of the neck.\\n\\nThey go close to the heart and a little bit behind it,\\n\\nand they go down and they form synapses.\\n\\nThat is, they form connections with the diaphragm.\\n\\nAnd when those neurons release neurotransmitter,\\n\\nwhich are little chemicals,\\n\\nthe diaphragm contracts and it moves down.\\n\\nSo we say that the phrenic nerve is a motor nerve.\\n\\nIt's designed to move muscle.\\n\\nHowever, the phrenic nerve,\\n\\nlike a few other nerves in the body,\\n\\nis interesting in that it has not just motor nerves\\n\\nin there, neurons that control the contraction of muscles,\\n\\nit also can sense things, it has sensory neurons.\\n\\nSo it also sends connections down to the diaphragm\\n\\nand actually down deep into the diaphragm\\n\\nand close to the liver.\\n\\nAnd note that I said liver twice now already,\\n\\nand we're going to get back to this later\\n\\nwhen we talk about physical movement and cramps of the body.\\n\\nThose sensory neurons dive deep into the diaphragm\\n\\nand then they go back up to the brain\\n\\nand they allow you to sense where the diaphragm is.\\n\\nSo they're giving information\\n\\nabout where the diaphragm is in your body.\\n\\nNow, most of the time you're not paying attention to this,\\n\\nbut right now you can actually try this\\n\\nand I would encourage you to do this.\\n\\nDiaphragmatic breathing is in many ways\\n\\nthe ideal way to breathe\\n\\nand that it's the most efficient way to breathe.\\n\\nWe'll talk about what we mean exactly\\n\\nwhen we say breathing efficiency later.\\n\\nBut the diaphragm is designed to allow the lungs to expand\\n\\nor to contract the lungs to bring air into the body\\n\\nor to remove carbon dioxide from the body.\\n\\nAnd if you want to know\\n\\nwhether or not you're using diaphragmatic breathing,\\n\\nit's very simple.\\n\\nIf you inhale, probably best to do this through the nose,\\n\\nbut you could do it through the mouth.\\n\\nIf you inhale and your belly moves outward on the inhale,\\n\\nwell, then that phrenic nerve\\n\\nis controlling your diaphragm properly.\\n\\nAnd then when you exhale,\\n\\nyour belly should go in just a little bit.\\n\\nThat's diaphragmatic breathing.\\n\\nNow, diaphragmatic breathing is talked about\\n\\nin the context of yoga.\\n\\nIt's often talked about as a way to calm down and so on.\\n\\nBut diaphragmatic breathing is just one mode\\n\\nby which your brain and the phrenic nerve\\n\\ncan control muscle, the diaphragm,\\n\\nto control the mechanical aspects of the lungs\\n\\nto bring in air and expel air.\\n\\nAs I mentioned before, you also have these muscles\\n\\nbetween your ribs or the intercostal muscles.\\n\\nAnd there's a separate set of nerves\\n\\nthat allow those muscles to contract\\n\\nand for your rib cage to expand\\n\\nin order to create more room for your lungs\\n\\nto get larger and fill with air\\n\\nor for your rib cage to contract a bit\\n\\nwhen those muscles relax in order to expel air.\\n\\nI'd like to go on record by saying that there is no rule\\n\\nthat diaphragmatic breathing is better\\n\\nthan breathing where your rib cage moves.\\n\\nThis is a common misconception.\\n\\nPeople say, oh, if your shoulders are going up and down\\n\\nand your rib cage is moving while you're breathing,\\n\\nwell, then you're not breathing right.\\n\\nAnd if your belly goes out\\n\\nand the rest of your body is still while you breathe,\\n\\nwell, then you're breathing correctly.\\n\\nI know of zero, in fact, zero minus one data\\n\\nto support that statement.\\n\\nYou have multiple parallel mechanisms\\n\\nto control the mechanics of your lungs and for breathing.\\n\\nAnd when you're exerting yourself very hard,\\n\\nyou tend to use both the intercostal muscles\\n\\nand your rib cage moving as well as your diaphragm\\n\\nin order to bring in a lot of oxygen\\n\\nand to offload a lot of carbon dioxide.\\n\\nAnd when you're calmer, frankly,\\n\\nyou could use diaphragmatic breathing\\n\\nor you could use rib cage type breathing\\n\\nin order to bring enough oxygen into your system.\\n\\nThere's no real data showing\\n\\nthat diaphragmatic breathing is somehow better or worse.\\n\\nHowever, being able to mechanically control\\n\\nthose independently or to combine them\\n\\nand use them together is of tremendous power\\n\\ntoward regulating your mental and physical states.\\n\\nAnd we'll talk about how to do that a little bit later.\\n\\nFor right now, please understand\\n\\nthat you have these different mechanical components\\n\\nthat allow you to bring oxygen into your system\\n\\nand to expel air\\n\\nand to thereby offload carbon dioxide from your system.\\n\\nAgain, we haven't talked about the gas exchange\\n\\nof carbon dioxide and oxygen\\n\\nand how that's happening in the bloodstream.\\n\\nWe'll talk about that next.\\n\\nBut the basic mechanical components are pretty simple.\\n\\nOnce again, just to review, it's nose, mouth, larynx, lungs,\\n\\navioli within the lungs, and then those two muscles,\\n\\nthe diaphragm and the intercostal muscles of the ribs.\\n\\nOne thing I failed to mention is why it's so important\\n\\nthat that larynx be rigid,\\n\\nthat it's a tube that is very rigid.\\n\\nAnd the reason for that is that unlike the lungs,\\n\\nwhich you want to act as sort of a bellow pump\\n\\nwhere you can deflate it and inflate it\\n\\nin order to move air in and out,\\n\\nthe larynx needs to be rigid so that it doesn't collapse\\n\\nwhile you're bringing air in and out.\\n\\nYou can imagine that if it was a very flimsy tube\\n\\nor the walls of the larynx were very flimsy and thin,\\n\\nwell, then you can imagine breathing in very vigorously\\n\\nand it would shut like a tube\\n\\nthat suddenly flattens on itself,\\n\\nwhich would not be good.\\n\\nSo the fact that the larynx is rigid\\n\\nis actually a very crucial part of this whole system.\\n\\nThe other important aspect of this system\\n\\nas it relates to the mechanics of breathing\\n\\nis the fact that your nose and your mouth\\n\\nhave different resistances to air.\\n\\nYou can probably notice this right now\\n\\nif you were to, for instance,\\n\\nbreathe in through your mouth\\n\\nand only through your mouth\\n\\nversus breathe in through your nose.\\n\\nSome of you perhaps have a harder time breathing\\n\\nin through your nose.\\n\\nBy the way, it's perfectly normal\\n\\nthat one or the other nostril\\n\\nwould be harder to breathe through\\n\\nor easier to breathe through\\n\\nand that that switches across the day.\\n\\nIt has to do with the flow of mucus\\n\\nand cerebral spinal fluid and intracranial pressure.\\n\\nTotally normal.\\n\\nMany people out there think they have a deviated septum\\n\\nwho don't actually have a deviated septum.\\n\\nA little bit later we'll talk about\\n\\nhow to repair a deviated septum without surgery\\n\\nbecause that actually is possible in many, not all cases\\n\\nand is immensely beneficial to do.\\n\\nBut what we know is that breathing in through the nose\\n\\nis a little bit harder\\n\\nand it's supposed to be a little bit harder.\\n\\nHowever, because it's a little bit harder,\\n\\nbecause there's more resistance as we say,\\n\\nyou are actually able to draw more force\\n\\ninto these mechanical aspects of the breathing apparatus\\n\\nand actually bring more air into your lungs.\\n\\nYou can try this right now.\\n\\nTry breathing in through your mouth\\n\\nto maximally inflate your lungs\\n\\nand try and do it through mostly diaphragmatic breathing,\\n\\njust for sake of example.\\n\\nIn other words, try and breathe in through your mouth\\n\\nand as you do that, have your belly expand\\n\\nand maximally inflate your lungs.\\n\\nI'll do it right now with you\\n\\nso that we can do it together\\n\\nand I can prove to everyone\\n\\nthat I'm just as deficient in this as you are.\\n\\nOkay, so I can inflate my stomach doing that,\\n\\nbut now try doing it with your nose\\n\\nand please do exhale before you try doing it with your nose.\\n\\nWith your nose, you're going to feel more resistance,\\n\\nbut you'll notice that you can inflate it\\n\\nquite a bit further.\\n\\nAnd you'll feel your entire cavity,\\n\\nyour belly and maybe even in your lower back,\\n\\nso fill with some pressure.\\n\\nSo the increased resistance\\n\\nactually allows you to draw more air into the system.\\n\\nThis turns out to be very important\\n\\nand it also wipes away a common misconception,\\n\\nwhich is if you're somebody who has challenges breathing in\\n\\nthrough your nose,\\n\\nthat somehow you should avoid breathing in\\n\\nthrough your nose.\\n\\nActually quite the opposite is true\\n\\nand we can go a step further\\n\\nand say that if you have challenges breathing in\\n\\nthrough your nose,\\n\\nchances are that's because the increased resistance\\n\\nof breathing in through your nose,\\n\\nprovided it's not completely occluded,\\n\\nis going to allow you to bring more oxygen into your system.\\n\\nThis will turn out to be useful later\\n\\nwhen we explore different techniques, for instance,\\n\\nnot just to calm down quickly,\\n\\nbut to elevate your energy quickly,\\n\\nto remove a cramp during exercise\\n\\nand a number of other things that breathing can be used for\\n\\nthat can be immensely useful\\n\\nfor mental and physical challenges.\\n\\nI'd like to take a quick break\\n\\nand acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.\\n\\nAthletic Greens now called AG1\\n\\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\\n\\nthat

Athletic Greens\\n\\nand the reason I still take Athletic Greens once\\n\\nor usually twice a day is that it gets to be\\n\\nthe probiotics that I need for gut health.\\n\\nOur gut is very important.\\n\\nIt's populated by gut microbiota\\n\\nthat communicate with the brain, the immune system,\\n\\nand basically all the biological systems of our body\\n\\nto strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.\\n\\nAnd those probiotics in Athletic Greens\\n\\nare optimal and vital for microbiotic health.\\n\\nIn addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,\\n\\nvitamins, and minerals that make sure\\n\\nthat all of my foundational nutritional needs are met.\\n\\nAnd it tastes great.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\\n\\nyou can go

etc.\\n\\nAnd they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.\\n\\nAgain, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman\\n\\nto get the five free travel packs\\n\\nand the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.\\n\\nSo now let's talk about the chemical aspects of breathing.\\n\\nAnd the two major players in this discussion are oxygen,\\n\\nwhich all the cells and tissues of your body need,\\n\\nand carbon dioxide, which all the cells and tissues\\n\\nof your body need.\\n\\nIn fact, carbon dioxide plays critical roles\\n\\nin delivering oxygen to your cells.\\n\\nAnd without carbon dioxide,\\n\\nyou're not going to get enough oxygen\\n\\nto the cells and tissues of your body.\\n\\nThat said, if carbon dioxide levels are too high,\\n\\nthat is very problematic.\\n\\nIn fact, one of the ways that one can reliably induce panic\\n\\nin anybody is to have them breathe air\\n\\nthat contains too much carbon dioxide.\\n\\nSo much so that for people that lack a so-called amygdala,\\n\\nmany of you have probably heard of the amygdala,\\n\\nthis is a brain area that's associated\\n\\nwith fear and threat detection,\\n\\neven in people who completely lack amygdalas\\n\\non both sides of the brain because they were removed,\\n\\nbecause they had epileptic seizures there.\\n\\nAnd therefore those people are completely unafraid\\n\\nof things that they ought to be afraid of,\\n\\nlike heights, poisonous snakes,\\n\\nany number of different things dangerous to humans.\\n\\nWell, if those people breathe an excess amount\\n\\nof carbon dioxide, they immediately have a panic attack.\\n\\nWhat that tells us is that again,\\n\\nthere are parallel mechanisms,\\n\\nthere's redundancy in the system to protect ourselves\\n\\nfrom having too much carbon dioxide in our system.\\n\\nSo we need enough carbon dioxide\\n\\nand enough oxygen in our system, but not too much.\\n\\nThe way that's accomplished is that of course,\\n\\nwe breathe in air, our lungs inflate.\\n\\nAnd if you recall those little avioli of the lungs,\\n\\nthose little sacks, oxygen can actually move\\n\\nfrom the air into those little sacks\\n\\nand then from those little sacks into the vasculature.\\n\\nThe vasculature are the capillaries, the veins\\n\\nand the arteries of the body,\\n\\nbecause the walls of those little avioli\\n\\nare exceedingly thin and they have tons\\n\\nof little capillaries that go into them\\n\\nand are all around them.\\n\\nSo this is amazing, right?\\n\\nThere's oxygen literally passing\\n\\nfrom inside of these little sacks in our lungs\\n\\nbecause we inhaled the oxygen from the air\\n\\ninto the bloodstream and then that oxygen gets bound up\\n\\nby proteins in the blood, in particular hemoglobin\\n\\nand hemoglobin then delivers oxygen to the various cells\\n\\nand tissues of the body.\\n\\nHowever, oxygen can't just hop on hemoglobin\\n\\nand cruise along with hemoglobin until it gets\\n\\nto say your brain and then hop off.\\n\\nIt doesn't work that way.\\n\\nYou require carbon dioxide in order\\n\\nto liberate oxygen from hemoglobin.\\n\\nCarbon dioxide has this incredible property\\n\\nof actually being able to change the shape of hemoglobin.\\n\\nHemoglobin is shaped as a sort of a cage\\n\\naround oxygen molecules and when it's in that cage shape\\n\\nthe oxygen can't be liberated.\\n\\nSo you've got oxygen and hemoglobin bound to one another\\n\\nmoving through your bloodstream\\n\\nbut if a tissue needs oxygen,\\n\\nthere needs to be carbon dioxide present\\n\\nto open up that cage and that's what carbon dioxide does.\\n\\nIt allows that cage to change shape\\n\\nand then the oxygen can be liberated\\n\\nand then can be delivered to the tissues\\n\\nwhether or not that's brain tissue or muscle tissue\\n\\nso on and so forth.\\n\\nAnd so those are the major chemical components of breathing.\\n\\nThere are a few other aspects related\\n\\nto the chemical components of breathing\\n\\nsuch as the fact that carbon dioxide is strongly related\\n\\nto how acidic or how basic your body is in general.\\n\\nSo for instance, if carbon dioxide levels go way down\\n\\nyour blood pH goes way up, that is you become more alkaline.\\n\\nNow for many people the word pH\\n\\nand the whole concept of pH immediately starts\\n\\nto evoke anxiety in and of itself.\\n\\npH is actually very simple.\\n\\nYou want the body basically to be at a pH of about 7.4.\\n\\nThere are some regions of your body\\n\\nin particular along the gut\\n\\nto which that number is importantly different\\n\\nin order for digestion to work properly.\\n\\nYou've all heard of the gut microbiome,\\n\\nthe little microbes that provided you have enough of them\\n\\nand they're diverse enough, allow your brain and body\\n\\nto function optimally at the level of immune system,\\n\\nhormone system, brain, et cetera.\\n\\nWell, in the gut you want the pH\\n\\nsometimes to be slightly more acidic\\n\\nbecause when it's more acidic\\n\\nthe little microbiota flourish\\n\\nfar more than if it were more basic.\\n\\nBut basically you want the rest of the body\\n\\nto be at about pH 7.4.\\n\\nIf carbon dioxide levels go too low\\n\\nthe pH increases in a way that you might say,\\n\\noh, well that's bad, but that actually allows more oxygen\\n\\nto be available to the tissues of your body\\n\\nat least temporarily.\\n\\nWe'll talk about this a bit more later.\\n\\nIf I'm losing any of you just hang in there\\n\\nbecause we're almost done with this whole business\\n\\nof the mechanics and the chemistry of breathing\\n\\nand then we can get into the tools\\n\\nand revisit some of this later\\n\\nto clean up any misunderstandings that may have arisen.\\n\\nBut as we're talking about carbon dioxide over and over again\\n\\nand how key it is to have carbon dioxide\\n\\nand the problems with it going too high or too low,\\n\\nyou should probably be asking yourself\\n\\nwhat actually makes carbon dioxide go too low, right?\\n\\nWe know that we breathe in oxygen\\n\\nand then it can pass from the lungs\\n\\nand the avioli into the bloodstream\\n\\nand then we need carbon dioxide to liberate oxygen\\n\\nfrom the hemoglobin into the cells and tissues of the body.\\n\\nAnd we know that when we exhale\\n\\nwhere actually I haven't told you this yet\\n\\nbut you should know that when you exhale\\n\\ncarbon dioxide is actually taken from the bloodstream\\n\\nback into those avioli of the lungs.\\n\\nAnd then when you exhale,\\n\\nit's expelled through your mouth or through your nose\\n\\nout into the world.\\n\\nSo the way I just described all that,\\n\\ninhale, bring in oxygen, exhale, expel carbon dioxide,\\n\\npretty straightforward, right?\\n\\nIndeed it is.\\n\\nAnd it also tells you that were you to exhale a lot more\\n\\nor a lot more vigorously,\\n\\nyou would expel more carbon dioxide.\\n\\nAnd in fact, that's exactly the way it works.\\n\\nWhen you hyperventilate,\\n\\nof course you are inhaling more than usual\\n\\nbut you are also exhaling more than usual.\\n\\nSo you're of course bringing in more air\\n\\nand oxygen to your body\\n\\nbut you're also removing more carbon dioxide\\n\\nfrom your body than normal.\\n\\nCarbon dioxide, because of the ways\\n\\nthat it regulates brain state,\\n\\nin fact the way in which it regulates the excitability,\\n\\nliterally the ability of your neurons\\n\\nto engage electrically or not,\\n\\nit can create states of panic and anxiety\\n\\nwhich is why when you hyperventilate,\\n\\nyou feel an increase in anxiety\\n\\nor when you feel an increase in anxiety,\\n\\nyou hyperventilate, it's a reciprocal relationship.\\n\\nIn fact, I don't want anyone who has anxiety\\n\\nor who has panic attacks to try this now\\n\\nbut for most people it's probably safe\\n\\nas long as you're not driving\\n\\nor doing something mechanical\\n\\nor operating machinery that is,\\n\\nprobably safe to do 25 or 30 deep inhales and exhales\\n\\nand you'll notice that by about breath 10,\\n\\nyou'll start to feel tingly\\n\\nand you'll probably feel a little bit more alert\\n\\nand again, if you have anxiety or panic attack tendencies,\\n\\nplease don't do this\\n\\nbut you will feel an increase\\n\\nin so-called autonomic arousal,\\n\\nan increase in the activity\\n\\nof your overall sympathetic nervous system\\n\\nwhich has nothing to do with sympathy,\\n\\nhas everything to do with alertness.\\n\\nYou'll actually deploy adrenaline from your adrenals.\\n\\nSo I'll just do this now.\\n\\nYou can try this now again,\\n\\nprovided you're in a safe place\\n\\nand you don't have anxiety or panic attack tendencies.\\n\\nYou will just breathe in through your nose\\n\\nand out through your mouth.\\n\\nRemember, we're breathing in more and more vigorously\\n\\nand we're exhaling more and more vigorously\\n\\nthan we normally would.\\n\\nIt goes something like this.\\n\\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.\\n\\nNow by breath eight or nine or 10,\\n\\nyou'll notice that your body starts to heat up.\\n\\nThat's due to a couple of things,\\n\\nmainly the release of adrenaline from your adrenals.\\n\\nI'm already feeling a little bit lightheaded.\\n\\nThe lightheadedness is actually because your vasculature,\\n\\nthe capillaries and veins,\\n\\nand to some extent, even the arteries of your body\\n\\nand particularly in your brain\\n\\nare actually starting to constrict.\\n\\nSo you're cutting off blood flow to the brain.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nWell, because carbon dioxide actually is a vasodilator.\\n\\nNormally it exists in your body\\n\\nto keep capillaries, veins and arteries dilated\\n\\nto allow blood to pass through them.\\n\\nWhen you hyperventilate,\\n\\nsure, you're bringing in a lot of oxygen\\n\\nwhich you think would make you more alert\\n\\nand indeed it does,\\n\\nbut you are also expelling a lot more carbon dioxide\\n\\nthan you normally would.\\n\\nAnd that's causing some vasoconstriction\\n\\nand you're going to start feeling tingly in the periphery\\n\\nin your fingers and toes perhaps, or your legs.\\n\\nYou will also notice that you're feeling more alert\\n\\nin the brain, but that you might start\\n\\nto feel a bit of anxiety.\\n\\nSo hyperventilation, yes, brings in more oxygen,\\n\\nalso removes more carbon dioxide.\\n\\nThe removal of excess carbon dioxide puts you\\n\\ninto a state that's called hypokapnic, all right?\\n\\nHypoxia, hypoxia is reduced levels\\n\\nof oxygen relative to normal.\\n\\nHypokapnia is reduced levels\\n\\nof carbon dioxide relative to normal.\\n\\nAnd it is those reduced levels of carbon dioxide\\n\\nthat are largely responsible for that elevation in energy.\\n\\nAnd at the same time, a feeling of a bit of anxiety,\\n\\nthe constriction of the microvasculature\\n\\nin the brain and body,\\n\\nand therefore the feelings of being kind of tingly\\n\\nand having kind of an urgency to move.\\n\\nOkay, so by now it should be clear\\n\\nthat we need both oxygen and carbon dioxide.\\n\\nAnd across the course of this episode,\\n\\nI will explain how to adjust those ratios\\n\\nof oxygen to carbon dioxide,\\n\\ndepending on what your immediate needs are\\n\\nand what you plan to do next,\\n\\nwhether or not that's sleep or exercise\\n\\nor some mental work, et cetera.\\n\\nBefore going any further, however,\\n\\nthere is something I want to touch on\\n\\nbecause even though not everyone will experience this,\\n\\nI think enough people experience it\\n\\nthat it is of interest and now's the right time\\n\\nto touch into what happens\\n\\nwhen you go up to a very high altitude,\\n\\nmeaning why it's hard to breathe\\n\\nwhen you get up to high altitudes.\\n\\nSo if you're close to sea level,\\n\\nyou are getting kind of the optimal balance of oxygen\\n\\nin the air you breathe.\\n\\nAs you ascend in altitude,\\n\\nso let's say you go to 6,000 feet or 10,000\\n\\nor maybe even 11,000 feet above sea level,\\n\\nor maybe you're one of those rare individuals\\n\\nthat climbs Denali or you climb Mount Everest\\n\\nand you get up there and you notice that most people\\n\\nare going to wear an oxygen mask.\\n\\nWhy is it that you need an oxygen mask\\n\\nat those very high altitudes\\n\\nor when people do these very high altitude skydives\\n\\nthat they need oxygen way up high?\\n\\nWell, a lot of people will say,\\n\\noh, there's not much oxygen up there.\\n\\nThe air is thinner.\\n\\nOkay, well, perhaps a better way to think about it\\n\\nis that remember when we were talking\\n\\nabout the mechanical aspects of breathing\\n\\nand the fact that the lungs don't really move themselves,\\n\\nthat they have the muscles, the diaphragm\\n\\nand the intercostal muscles to move them.\\n\\nWell, a lot of the reason why your lungs\\n\\ncan fill so readily with air\\n\\nis that when you don't have much air in your lungs,\\n\\nthere's very low air pressure in your lungs\\n\\nrelative to outside you, okay?\\n\\nSo what we mean then is if you were to open up your mouth\\n\\nor your nose and breathe in,\\n\\nthat is breathe in through your nose or mouth,\\n\\nwhat's going to happen is air is going to move\\n\\nfrom high pressure to low pressure.\\n\\nSo it's very easy to fill your lungs.\\n\\nEven though you need those muscles\\n\\nto move the various things around\\n\\nthat allow your lungs to fill,\\n\\nthe air is going to go from high pressure to low pressure.\\n\\nSo for those of you listening,\\n\\nI just took a big inhale through my nose.\\n\\nAnd then when you exhale, right?\\n\\nYou're basically taking the lungs from a state\\n\\nin which the pressure is really high in the lungs,\\n\\nhigh pressure, like a balloon that's full.\\n\\nAnd the pressure in your lungs when your lungs are full\\n\\nis higher than the air outside.\\n\\nSo it's pretty easy to expel that air\\n\\nthrough the nose or mouth.\\n\\nWhen you're at high altitudes, the air pressure is lower.\\n\\nAnd so what happens is when the air pressure\\n\\nis lower outside your body\\n\\nand your lungs are not full of air,\\n\\nyou don't have that really steep gradient\\n\\nof high pressure outside the body\\n\\nto low pressure inside your lungs.\\n\\nAnd so you actually have to put a lot more effort\\n\\ninto breathing air into your lungs.\\n\\nYou have to really exert a lot of force.\\n\\nYou have to get the diaphragm,\\n\\nthose intercostal muscles working really hard.\\n\\nYou might even find that your shoulders\\n\\nare lifting with each breath\\n\\nbecause you really have to generate a lot of force\\n\\nto get enough air and oxygen into your lungs.\\n\\nNow, an important principle to understand\\n\\nis that in humans and in some other species,\\n\\nbut really what we're talking about now is humans,\\n\\nwhen you inhale, that's an active process.\\n\\nYou really need to use those muscles of the intercostals\\n\\nin the diaphragm in order to inflate the lungs.\\n\\nBut the whole process is made easier\\n\\nwhen air pressure outside your body is higher\\n\\nthan it is in your lungs,\\n\\nbecause then they're going to fill up really readily.\\n\\nExhaling, at least for humans, is a passive thing.\\n\\nYou just have to relax the diaphragm\\n\\nand relax the intercostals and let the rib cage\\n\\nfall back to its original position.\\n\\nSo inhaling is active and exhaling is passive.\\n\\nAnd so what happens is if you're at a high altitude\\n\\nand the air pressure is very low,\\n\\nthen you have to put a lot of energy\\n\\ninto breathing air into your lungs\\n\\nto get an equivalent amount of oxygen into your lungs\\n\\nand then into the bloodstream.\\n\\nSo that's why when you arrive at a high altitude location\\n\\nfor the first few days,\\n\\nyou're going to feel lightheaded, maybe a headache.\\n\\nYou're also going to have more buildup\\n\\nof carbon dioxide in your system.\\n\\nAnd so the whole balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide\\n\\nis going to be disrupted.\\n\\nI mention all that because yes, indeed,\\n\\nthere are some changes in the atmospheric gases\\n\\nat high altitudes,\\n\\nand that can impact how much oxygen\\n\\nyou can bring into your system, into your tissues.\\n\\nBut I've heard many explanations\\n\\nof why it's hard to breathe\\n\\nor why you feel lousy at altitude.\\n\\nWell, you just discovered one reason,\\n\\nwhich is that you don't have that steep high pressure\\n\\nto low pressure gradient from the outside of the body\\n\\ninto the inside of the body.\\n\\nThe converse is also true.\\n\\nIf you've been at altitude for a few days\\n\\nand you've had the opportunity to adjust,\\n\\na lot of athletes, for instance, will go train at altitude.\\n\\nIt's hard for them in the first days or weeks,\\n\\nand then they get really good at training at altitude.\\n\\nThere are a number of different adaptations that occur\\n\\nin terms of the amount of oxygen\\n\\nthat could be carried in the blood by hemoglobin\\n\\nand the interactions between carbon dioxide\\n\\nand hemoglobin and oxygen\\n\\nthat allow more oxygen to be delivered to the tissues\\n\\nsuch that at altitude, you can function just normally.\\n\\nBut if you then move very quickly from altitude,\\n\\nsay you've been training at 8,000 feet or 10,000 feet,\\n\\nyou've been hiking up at that high level and you've adapted\\n\\nand you come down to sea level,\\n\\nwell, for about two to five days,\\n\\nyou're going to feel like an absolute beast.\\n\\nYou're going to be able to essentially deliver far more\\n\\noxygen to your muscles per breath.\\n\\nIn part, that is because of the way that the hemoglobin\\n\\nand the oxygen that it's carrying has been altered\\n\\nwhen you were at high altitude,\\n\\nbut it's also because when you were at that high altitude,\\n\\nthose intracostal muscles and those diaphragms\\n\\ngot trained up quite a bit and allowed you\\n\\nto generate more air volume for every breath.\\n\\nIn other words, those muscles got stronger\\n\\nand you got more efficient at driving the phrenic nerve\\n\\nconsciously to really breathe in a lot of oxygen\\n\\nso you don't feel lightheaded, headache, et cetera.\\n\\nOkay, so that's a little bit of an aside,\\n\\nbut it's an important aside, I believe,\\n\\nbecause A, it answers a question a lot of people ask\\n\\nand a lot of people wonder about,\\n\\nand B, because it incorporates both the mechanical aspects\\n\\nof breathing and the chemical aspects of breathing.\\n\\nI realize it's a little bit of an unusual circumstance,\\n\\nbut now if anyone asks you why it's hard to breathe\\n\\nat altitude, you know it has to do with this lack\\n\\nof a high pressure to low pressure gradient\\n\\nacross the body and with the atmosphere outside you.\\n\\nIt's also an opportunity for me to say\\n\\nthat if you do find yourself at altitude\\n\\nand you have a headache or you're feeling\\n\\nlike you just can't catch your breath,\\n\\nspending some time really consciously trying to draw\\n\\nin larger breaths of air, as much as that might seem\\n\\nfatiguing and you'll be short of breath,\\n\\nit will allow you to adapt more quickly.\\n\\nAnd a little bit later in the episode,\\n\\nwe'll touch on a few methods,\\n\\nincluding deliberate hyperventilation combined\\n\\nwith some breath holds that can allow you\\n\\nto deliver more oxygen to the cells immediately\\n\\nupon arriving at altitude so you don't get\\n\\nquite as much headache, disorientation and so on.\\n\\nSo leaving breathing at altitude aside,\\n\\nlet's all come back down to the same conceptual level.\\n\\nWe can ask ourselves, for instance,\\n\\nwhat is healthy breathing and what is unhealthy breathing?\\n\\nAnd the first place we want to tackle this\\n\\nis within the context of sleep.\\n\\nSo when we go to sleep at night, we continue to breathe.\\n\\nThat's no surprise.\\n\\nIf we didn't, we would die during sleep.\\n\\nHowever, there is a large fraction of the population\\n\\nthat under-breathes during sleep.\\n\\nThey're not taking deep enough or frequent enough breaths.\\n\\nAnd therefore they are experiencing\\n\\nwhat's called sleep apnea.\\n\\nThey are becoming hypoxic, hypo-oxic.\\n\\nThere's less oxygen being brought into their system\\n\\nthan is necessary.\\n\\nPeople that are carrying excess weight,\\n\\neither fat weight or muscle weight or both,\\n\\nare more prone to nighttime sleep apnea.\\n\\nHowever, there are a lot of people who are not overweight\\n\\nwho also experience sleep apnea.\\n\\nHow do you know if you're experiencing sleep apnea?\\n\\nWell, first of all, excessive daytime sleepiness\\n\\nand excessive daytime anxiety combined\\n\\nwith daytime sleepiness is one sign\\n\\nthat you might be suffering from sleep apnea.\\n\\nThe other thing is if you happen to snore,\\n\\nit's very likely that you are experiencing sleep apnea.\\n\\nAnd I should mention that sleep apnea\\n\\nis a very serious health concern.\\n\\nIt greatly increases the probability\\n\\nof a cardiovascular event, heart attack, stroke.\\n\\nIt is a precursor or sometimes the direct cause\\n\\nof sexual dysfunction in males and females,\\n\\ncognitive dysfunction during the daytime.\\n\\nIt can exacerbate the effects of dementia,\\n\\nwhether or not it's age-related dementia of the normal sort\\n\\nor Alzheimer's type dementia,\\n\\nwhich is an acceleration of age-related cognitive decline.\\n\\nIf you're somebody who's had a traumatic brain injury,\\n\\nif you're experiencing a lot of stress,\\n\\nsleep apnea is going to greatly disrupt\\n\\nthe amount of oxygen brought into your brain and body\\n\\nduring sleep and is going to lead to a number of nighttime\\n\\nand daytime issues.\\n\\nSo it's something that really needs to be addressed\\n\\nand we'll get into this a bit more later,\\n\\nbut since I raised it as a problem,\\n\\nI do want to raise the solution.\\n\\nOne of the major treatments for sleep apnea\\n\\nis that people will get a CPAP device,\\n\\nwhich is this face mask and a machine\\n\\nthat they'll sleep with.\\n\\nAnd while those can be very effective,\\n\\nnot everyone needs a CPAP.\\n\\nOne of the more common methods nowadays\\n\\nthat's being used to treat sleep apnea,\\n\\nwhich is purely behavioral and intervention\\n\\nand is essentially zero cost is that people are starting\\n\\nto shift deliberately to nasal breathing during sleep\\n\\nbecause of the additional resistance of nasal breathing\\n\\nand because of the fact that there's far less tendency,\\n\\nif any, excuse me, to snore when nasal breathing.\\n\\nTaping the mouth shut using medical tape prior to sleep,\\n\\nexcuse me, putting medical tape on the mouth\\n\\nprior to going to sleep and then sleeping all night\\n\\nwith medical tape on the mouth is one way\\n\\nthat people can learn to nasal breathe during sleeping\\n\\ncan greatly offset a lot of sleep apnea,\\n\\nsnoring and sleep related issues.\\n\\nA number of people don't want to or don't feel safe\\n\\nputting medical tape on their mouth prior to sleep.\\n\\nFor some reason, they think they're going to suffocate,\\n\\nbut of course you would wake up if you start to run out\\n\\nof air at any moment.\\n\\nSo that's not so much a concern,\\n\\nbut what they'll do is they will start to use\\n\\npure nasal breathing during any type of exercise\\n\\nor even just for some period of time,\\n\\nwalking during the day or while working.\\n\\nAnd again, later we'll get into the enormous benefits\\n\\nof shifting to pure nasal breathing\\n\\nwhen not exercising hard,\\n\\nmeaning at a rate that you could normally\\n\\nhold a conversation,\\n\\nalthough if you're pure nasal breathing,\\n\\nyou won't be holding that conversation.\\n\\nOr when simply doing work\\n\\nor any number of things that are sort of low intensity,\\n\\nyou can train your system to become a better nasal breather\\n\\nduring the daytime through these deliberate actions\\n\\nof taping the mouth shut or just being conscious\\n\\nof keeping your mouth shut.\\n\\nAnd that in addition to having a number of positive health\\n\\nand aesthetic effects during the daytime\\n\\nis known to also transfer to nighttime breathing patterns\\n\\nand allow people to become nasal breathers\\n\\nas opposed to mouth breathers during sleep\\n\\nand to snore less and to have less sleep apnea.\\n\\nAgain, if you have severe sleep apnea,\\n\\nyou probably do need to check out a CPAP.\\n\\nYou should talk to your physician.\\n\\nBut for people who have minor sleep apnea\\n\\nor sleep apnea that's starting to take hold,\\n\\nthese other methods of shifting to becoming a nasal breather\\n\\nare going to be far more beneficial\\n\\nand far more cost effective\\n\\nthan going all the way to the CPAP,\\n\\nwhich by the way, doesn't really teach you\\n\\nhow to breathe properly as much as it does\\n\\nadjust the airflow going into your system.\\n\\nThat's an important point that when you shift\\n\\nfrom mouth to nasal breathing during sleep,\\n\\nyou're actually learning and training your system\\n\\nto breathe properly.\\n\\nAnd when I say learning and training your system\\n\\nto breathe properly, what do I mean?\\n\\nLet's put some scientific and mechanistic meat on that.\\n\\nWe already talked about the phrenic nerve,\\n\\nthis nerve that innervates the diaphragm\\n\\nand that allows for the lungs to fill up\\n\\nbecause of the movement of the diaphragm.\\n\\nWhat we didn't talk about, however,\\n\\nwere the brain centers that actually control\\n\\nthe phrenic nerve and control breathing.\\n\\nKnowing about these two brain areas\\n\\nand what they do is extremely important,\\n\\nnot just for understanding the content of this episode,\\n\\nbut for understanding all of the tools that we'll discuss\\n\\nand indeed your general health as it relates to respiration.\\n\\nSo there are basically two areas of the brain\\n\\nthat control breathing.\\n\\nThe first is called the pre-Butzinger complex.\\n\\nYou don't have to worry about the name so much,\\n\\njust know that it was named after a bottle of wine\\n\\nand that it was discovered.\\n\\nBy the great Jack Feldman,\\n\\nwho's a professor of neuroscience\\n\\nat the University of California, Los Angeles.\\n\\nThis is one of the most fundamental discoveries\\n\\nin all of neuroscience in the last hundred years or more,\\n\\nbecause this brain area that Jack and his colleagues\\n\\ndiscovered controls all aspects of breathing that are rhythmic.\\n\\nThat is when inhales, follow exhales,\\n\\nfollow inhales, follow exhales.\\n\\nThat's all controlled by a small set of neurons\\n\\nin this brainstem area,\\n\\nso around the region of the neck\\n\\ncalled the pre-Butzinger complex.\\n\\nAnd we really owe a debt of gratitude to Jack\\n\\nand his colleagues for discovering that area\\n\\nbecause it's involved in everything\\n\\nfrom breathing when we're asleep\\n\\nto breathing when we're not thinking about our breathing.\\n\\nIt may have a role in that is\\n\\nwhen its function is disrupted,\\n\\nit may cause things like sudden infant death syndrome.\\n\\nBelieve it or not, it can explain in large part,\\n\\nmany of the deaths related to the opioid crisis\\n\\nbecause exogenous opioids like fentanyl\\n\\nand other sorts of drugs, which are opioids, obviously,\\n\\nbind to opioid receptors on that structure and shut it down.\\n\\nNow, keep in mind,\\n\\nthese neurons are designed to be incredibly robust\\n\\nand are designed to fire, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,\\n\\nno matter if we're awake or aware, unaware,\\n\\nor asleep to keep us alive.\\n\\nExogenous opioids like fentanyl\\n\\nand drugs that are similar to that\\n\\ncan shut down that structure\\n\\nbecause it's rich with these opioid receptors.\\n\\nSo it binds to that\\n\\nand it shuts off the pre-Batzinger complex,\\n\\nwhich is the major cause of death\\n\\nof people who die from opioid overdoses.\\n\\nI think a lot of people don't realize that.\\n\\nThey think, oh, the opioids must shut off the brain\\n\\nor shut down the heart.\\n\\nNo, it shuts down breathing.\\n\\nSo Jack's discovery, no doubt,\\n\\nwill lead to some important things\\n\\nas it relates to addiction.\\n\\nAnd hopefully, I think we, frankly, can expect\\n\\nthat it's also going to eventually lead to ways\\n\\nto prevent death in people using opioids\\n\\nor other types of drugs,\\n\\nmaybe by blocking opioid receptors\\n\\nin pre-Batzinger complex using things\\n\\nlike naltrexone, et cetera.\\n\\nIn any event, pre-Batzinger complex\\n\\nis controlling inhale, exhale, inhale,\\n\\nexhale to patterns of breathing.\\n\\nThe other brain center controlling breathing,\\n\\nagain, through the phrenic nerve, right?\\n\\nIt all converges and goes out through the phrenic nerve\\n\\nand these intercostal muscles\\n\\nis the so-called paraphacial nucleus.\\n\\nAnd the paraphacial nucleus is involved\\n\\nin patterns of breathing\\n\\nwhere there is not an inhale followed by exhale,\\n\\nthat is it's not rhythmic one than the other,\\n\\nbut rather where there is a doubling up of inhales\\n\\nor a doubling up of exhales\\n\\nor a deliberate pause in breathing.\\n\\nSo inhale, pause, exhale, pause,\\n\\ninhale, pause, exhale, pause, this sort of thing.\\n\\nA little bit later, we'll talk about a pattern\\n\\nof breathing called box breathing,\\n\\nwhich has a very specific and useful applications\\n\\nin particular for adjusting anxiety.\\n\\nAnd in that case, it involves going\\n\\nfrom rhythmic breathing of inhale, inhale, inhale, exhale,\\n\\nthat is relying on the pre-Butzinger complex neurons\\n\\nto reliance on the paraphacial nucleus neurons\\n\\nand box breathing, just to give away\\n\\nwhat's probably already obvious\\n\\nis you inhale, hold, exhale, hold and repeat.\\n\\nAnd that pattern of breathing,\\n\\neven though it's rhythmic in nature\\n\\nbecause inhales, precedes exhales, precedes inhales\\n\\nand so on, there's a deliberate breath hold inserted there.\\n\\nSo anytime we're taking conscious control of our breathing,\\n\\nthe paraphacial nucleus is getting involved.\\n\\nNow, you don't have to assume\\n\\nthat the paraphacial nucleus is the only way\\n\\nin which we take conscious control of our breathing.\\n\\nWe can also take control of the pre-Butzinger complex.\\n\\nYou can do that right now.\\n\\nSo for instance, you are breathing\\n\\nin some specific pattern now\\n\\nthat unless you're speaking or eating,\\n\\nno doubt is going to involve inhales followed by exhales.\\n\\nBut you could, for instance, decide that yes,\\n\\ninhales are active and exhales are passive,\\n\\nbut now you're going to make the exhales active as well.\\n\\nSo rather than just inhale and then let your lungs deflate,\\n\\nyou could inhale and then force the air out.\\n\\nThat's going to represent a conscious taking over\\n\\nof control of the pre-Butzinger complex.\\n\\nOkay, so the reason I'm giving this mechanistic detail is A,\\n\\nit's super important if you want to understand\\n\\nall the tools related to breathing.\\n\\nB, it's actually a pretty simple system.\\n\\nEven though the areas have fancy names\\n\\nlike pre-Butzinger or paraphacial,\\n\\nit's pretty straightforward, right?\\n\\nYou have one area that controls rhythmic breathing,\\n\\ninhale follows exhales.\\n\\nAnd the other area which gets involved in breathing\\n\\nanytime you start doubling up on inhales or exhales.\\n\\nIn fact, the paraphacial nucleus is the one\\n\\nthat you're relying on while you speak\\n\\nin order to make sure that you still get enough oxygen.\\n\\nIt's also the one that you will use\\n\\nif you incorporate the physiological sigh or box breathing.\\n\\nAnd frankly, most of the time,\\n\\nyou're using both of these circuits or these brain systems,\\n\\nparaphacial and pre-Butzinger, in parallel.\\n\\nAgain, biology loves parallel systems,\\n\\nespecially for things that are so critical\\n\\nthat if we didn't do them, we would die like breathing.\\n\\nAnd so it makes sense that we have two different\\n\\nbrain structures that control this.\\n\\nSo now you have an understanding\\n\\nof the mechanical control of breathing,\\n\\nthat is the different parts within the parts list\\n\\nthat are involved in breathing,\\n\\neverything from nose to mouth to avioli, the lungs, et cetera,\\n\\nand the muscles involved in moving the lungs.\\n\\nYou understand, I like to think a bit about\\n\\nbringing oxygen in and removing carbon dioxide,\\n\\nbut not so much carbon dioxide\\n\\nthat you can't actually use the oxygen that you have.\\n\\nAnd you know about two brain centers,\\n\\none controlling rhythmic breathing\\n\\nand one that controls non-rhythmic breathing.\\n\\nI want to repeat something\\n\\nthat I said a little bit earlier as well,\\n\\nwhich is that breathing is incredible\\n\\nbecause it represents the interface\\n\\nbetween conscious and subconscious control\\n\\nover your, not just body, not just your lungs,\\n\\nbut that how you breathe influences your brain state.\\n\\nSo by using your brain consciously\\n\\nto control your breathing,\\n\\nyou are using your brain to control your brain.\\n\\nThe best way I've ever heard this described\\n\\nwas from a beautiful, I should say now classic paper\\n\\nin the Journal of Physiology published in 1988\\n\\nfrom Balestrino and Sumjian,\\n\\nwhere the final line of their summary intro states,\\n\\nthe brain by regulating breathing\\n\\ncontrols its own excitability.\\n\\nAnd just to remind those of you\\n\\nthat don't remember what excitability is,\\n\\nexcitability is the threshold at which a given neuron,\\n\\na nerve cell can be active or not.\\n\\nSo when we breathe a certain way,\\n\\nthe neurons of our brain are more likely to get engaged.\\n\\nThey're more likely to be active.\\n\\nAnd when we breathe in other ways,\\n\\nour brain becomes harder to activate.\\n\\nIts excitability is reduced.\\n\\nNow you might think excitability is a great thing.\\n\\nYou always want your brain to be excitable,\\n\\nbut that's actually not the case.\\n\\nAnd in fact, that very statement\\n\\nthat Balestrino and Sumjian made\\n\\nled to a number of other investigations\\n\\nthat were really important in defining how\\n\\nif people over-breathe,\\n\\nthat is if they hyperventilate at rest,\\n\\nthey expel, that is they exhale too much carbon dioxide.\\n\\nWhat that classic paper by Balestrino and Sumjian led to\\n\\nwas a number of different investigations in humans,\\n\\nlooking at how different patterns of breathing\\n\\nimpact the overall state of the brain\\n\\nand the ability of the brain to respond to certain,\\n\\nwhat are called sensory stimuli.\\n\\nKeep in mind that your brain is always active.\\n\\nThe neurons are firing at low level, low level, low level.\\n\\nBut when you see something or hear something,\\n\\nor you want to focus on something,\\n\\nor you want to exercise or really listen to something\\n\\nor learn, certain circuits in your brain\\n\\nneed to be more active than everything else.\\n\\nThat is there needs to be really high\\n\\nwhat's called signal to noise.\\n\\nThere's always a lot of noise and chatter in the background,\\n\\njust like the chatter at a cocktail party\\n\\nor at a stadium event.\\n\\nIn order to really pay attention, focus, learn,\\n\\nall the incredible things that the brain can do,\\n\\nyou need that signal to get above the noise.\\n\\nThere's a beautiful paper that asks,\\n\\nhow does the pattern of breathing,\\n\\nin particular, how does over-breathing\\n\\nchange the patterns of activity in the brain?\\n\\nThis is a paper entitled\\n\\nEffects of Voluntary Hyperventilation\\n\\non Cortical Sensory Responses.\\n\\nAnd I will provide a link to the study\\n\\nin the show note captions.\\n\\nIt's a somewhat complicated paper.\\n\\nIf you look at all the detailed analysis,\\n\\nhowever, the takeaway from this paper is exquisitely simple\\n\\nand I also believe incredibly important.\\n\\nBasically what it showed is that when people hyperventilate,\\n\\nthey expel, that is they exhale more carbon dioxide\\n\\nthan they would normally.\\n\\nSo they become what's called hypocapnic, okay?\\n\\nCarbon dioxide levels are low in the blood\\n\\nand over a short period of time,\\n\\nthey become low in the tissues of the body.\\n\\nWhen that carbon dioxide level drops low,\\n\\nyou would say, okay, well,\\n\\nyou're still bringing in a lot of oxygen\\n\\nbecause these people are hyperventilating,\\n\\nso they should feel really alert.\\n\\nAnd indeed, that's what happens.\\n\\nThe people feel very alert.\\n\\nHowever, because they're not bringing enough\\n\\ncarbon dioxide in, or rather,\\n\\nthe proper way to say it would be,\\n\\nbecause they're over-breathing, exhaling too much,\\n\\nthey are not retaining or keeping in enough carbon dioxide.\\n\\nWell, then that lack of carbon dioxide means\\n\\nthat the oxygen that they are breathing in\\n\\ncan't be liberated from the hemoglobin,\\n\\ncan't get to the brain,\\n\\nand what they observe is about a 30 to 40% reduction\\n\\nin the amount of oxygen that's being delivered to the brain.\\n\\nAnd the reduction in carbon dioxide also prevents\\n\\nsome of the normal patterns of vasodilation,\\n\\nthe dilating, the opening up of the capillaries.\\n\\nSo again, less blood flow,\\n\\nbut most importantly, as it's shown in this paper,\\n\\nthe brain overall becomes hyper-excitable.\\n\\nIt's as if it's being starved of oxygen and blood flow,\\n\\nand all the neurons, in a very nonspecific way,\\n\\nstart increasing their firing level.\\n\\nSo the background activity is getting louder and louder.\\n\\nIt's like the rumble or the noise of a crowd at a stadium.\\n\\nAnd as a consequence, the sensory input from a sound\\n\\nor from a touch or from some other event in the world\\n\\ndoesn't get above the noise.\\n\\nWhat this means is that when we hyperventilate,\\n\\nbecause we aren't retaining enough carbon dioxide,\\n\\nwe are not getting enough oxygen\\n\\nto the tissues that need oxygen.\\n\\nAnd as a consequence of that,\\n\\nthe brain becomes hyper-excitable.\\n\\nWe actually know that there's an increase in anxiety,\\n\\nand we become less good, less efficient\\n\\nat detecting things in our environment.\\n\\nSo we're not processing information as well at all.\\n\\nThe noise goes up and the signal goes down.\\n\\nAgain, incredibly important set of findings.\\n\\nI should also mention that hyperventilation is one way\\n\\nthat in the laboratory anyway,\\n\\nor in neurosurgery units for some time,\\n\\nphysicians would evoke seizure in seizure-prone patients.\\n\\nThe reason that works\\n\\nis exactly the explanation I just gave you.\\n\\nSeizure is a hyper-excitability of the brain,\\n\\nnot enough inhibition or suppression of the overall circuitry.\\n\\nSo you get these waves\\n\\nor these storms of electrical activity.\\n\\nLow levels of carbon dioxide in the brain\\n\\nbecause of low levels of carbon dioxide in the blood\\n\\nare one of the major triggers for seizures.\\n\\nNow, I realize that most people listening to this\\n\\nare not epileptic, but nonetheless,\\n\\nthis brings us all back to this question\\n\\nof what is normal healthy breathing?\\n\\nAs I mentioned before,\\n\\nnormal healthy breathing is breathing\\n\\nabout six liters of air per minute.\\n\\nBut of course, most of us don't think\\n\\nin terms of liters of air,\\n\\nand we're not going to go measure our lung capacity,\\n\\nor at least most of us aren't going to do that.\\n\\nBasically, if you are taking relatively shallow breaths\\n\\nand you're just sitting there working\\n\\nor maybe even walking slowly,\\n\\nagain, not talking or engaging\\n\\nin any kind of speech or eating,\\n\\nchances are six liters of air per minute\\n\\nis about 12 shallow-ish breaths.\\n\\nAnd when I say shallow, I don't mean breathing\\n\\nlike a little bunny rabbit or something like that.\\n\\nI just mean casually breathing in, out, in, out.\\n\\nThe studies that have explored the breathing patterns\\n\\nin large populations of individuals\\n\\nwho are not suffering necessarily\\n\\nfrom any one specific ailment\\n\\nhave shown that most people breathe far too much per minute,\\n\\nthat they're engaging in anywhere from 15 to 20\\n\\nor even 30 shallow breaths per minute.\\n\\nSo they are vastly over-breathing\\n\\nrelative to how they should be breathing.\\n\\nNow, of course, if you breathe more deeply,\\n\\nso you take a vigorous inhale,\\n\\nand then you expel that air,\\n\\nwell, then to get six liters of air\\n\\ninto your system per minute,\\n\\nyou're probably only going to need\\n\\nsomewhere between four and six breaths\\n\\nin order to get that six liters per minute.\\n\\nNow, the total time that it takes\\n\\nto do that inhale and exhale\\n\\nisn't that much longer than a kind of shallow breath,\\n\\nprovided you're not deliberately breathing quickly\\n\\nduring those shallow breaths.\\n\\nSo then you say, well, how is it\\n\\nthat normal healthy breathing\\n\\nthat delivers the appropriate amount\\n\\nof carbon dioxide into the system\\n\\nand doesn't expel, doesn't exhale too much carbon dioxide?\\n\\nHow are we supposed to do that normal breathing, right?\\n\\nAre you supposed to breathe four times\\n\\nand then hold your breath until the minute passes?\\n\\nNo, what you find is that the correct pattern of breathing\\n\\nis going to involve two things.\\n\\nFirst of all, nasal breathing,\\n\\nbecause of the resistance it provides through the nose,\\n\\nwe talked about earlier,\\n\\nis going to deliver more oxygen into your system.\\n\\nYou're going to be able to generate more air pressure\\n\\nto fill your lungs.\\n\\nThat greater air pressure is going to take longer to exhale.\\n\\nSo already we're increasing the amount of time\\n\\nthat each breath is going to take.\\n\\nAnd also what you find is that people that are breathing\\n\\nin the proper healthy manner,\\n\\nthat is that are balancing oxygen and carbon dioxide\\n\\nin the proper ways,\\n\\nare also taking pauses between breaths.\\n\\nThis is extremely important\\n\\nbecause even though we have a brain center,\\n\\nthe Prebotsinger complex that can control,\\n\\nor I should say does control,\\n\\ninhale, exhale, rhythmic breathing,\\n\\nthose pauses between breaths are not always present.\\n\\nIn fact, often are not present\\n\\nfrom people's baseline breathing patterns\\n\\nand as a consequence, they over breathe.\\n\\nAnd as I told you before, when people over breathe,\\n\\ntheir brain becomes hyper excitable\\n\\nat the level of the background noise.\\n\\nAnd yet they are less efficient\\n\\nat detecting and learning information.\\n\\nAnd we'll get into the specific studies\\n\\nthat really illustrate the learning aspect a bit later,\\n\\nbut they are less efficient\\n\\nat detecting and learning information,\\n\\nat focusing and so on,\\n\\nas a consequence of this over breathing\\n\\nand the hyper excitability that causes.\\n\\nNow, of course, that's also just emphasizing\\n\\nthe effects of over breathing\\n\\nand lack of carbon dioxide on the brain.\\n\\nThere are hundreds, if not thousands of studies,\\n\\nshowing that when we don't have enough carbon dioxide\\n\\nin the tissues of our body,\\n\\nthat's also problematic for all the tissues,\\n\\nthe liver, the lungs themselves, the stomach, et cetera,\\n\\nthat relate largely to shifts in pH\\n\\nbecause of the fact that carbon dioxide strongly regulates\\n\\nthe acidity, alkalinity of the blood\\n\\nand the tissues that that blood supplies nutrients to,\\n\\nincluding carbon dioxide.\\n\\nSo the basic takeaway here is you want to breathe\\n\\nin a healthy manner at rest.\\n\\nAnd the best way to do that is to spend some time\\n\\nand it doesn't take much,\\n\\nmaybe a minute or so each day,\\n\\npaying attention to how quickly you are breathing per minute\\n\\nwhen you are simply at rest,\\n\\nwhen you're making coffee in the morning,\\n\\nwhen you're sitting down to read,\\n\\nwhen you're on social media,\\n\\nchronically holding your breath isn't good,\\n\\nbut neither is over breathing.\\n\\nAnd again, every study that has examined\\n\\nthe typical patterns of breathing\\n\\nand patterns of breathing that show up as normal\\n\\nand abnormal has found that more often than not,\\n\\nduring the nighttime, people are under breathing.\\n\\nAnd in the daytime, they're over breathing,\\n\\nthey're hyperventilating.\\n\\nI'd like to just take a brief moment\\n\\nand thank one of our podcast sponsors,\\n\\nwhich is InsideTracker.\\n\\nInsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform\\n\\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\\n\\nto help you better understand your body\\n\\nand help you reach your health goals.\\n\\nI've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done\\n\\nfor the simple reason that blood work is the only way\\n\\nthat you can monitor the markers such as hormone markers,\\n\\nlipids, metabolic factors, et cetera,\\n\\nthe impact your immediate and long-term health.\\n\\nOne major challenge with blood work, however,\\n\\nis that most of the time,\\n\\nit does not come back with any information\\n\\nabout what to do in order to move the values\\n\\nfor hormones, metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,\\n\\ninto the ranges that you want.\\n\\nWith InsideTracker, changing those values\\n\\nbecomes very straightforward\\n\\nbecause it has a personalized dashboard that you can use\\n\\nto address the nutrition-based, behavior-based,\\n\\nsupplement-based approaches that you can use\\n\\nin order to move those values into the ranges\\n\\nthat are optimal for you, your vitality,\\n\\nand your longevity.\\n\\nInsideTracker now includes a measurement\\n\\nof apolipoprotein B, so-called APO-B,\\n\\nin their ultimate plan.\\n\\nAPO-B is a key marker of cardiovascular health,\\n\\nand therefore, there's extreme value\\n\\nto knowing your APO-B levels.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\\n\\nyou can go to InsideTracker.com slash Huberman\\n\\nto get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.\\n\\nAgain, that's InsideTracker.com slash Huberman\\n\\nto get 20% off.\\n\\nSo next, I'd like to address what you can do\\n\\nabout your normal patterns of breathing.\\n\\nThat is how you or anyone can adjust\\n\\ntheir normal patterns of breathing\\n\\nfrom an unhealthy to an unhealthy state.\\n\\nBut the first thing we have to do, of course,\\n\\nis determine whether or not you're already breathing\\n\\nin an unhealthy or in a healthy way.\\n\\nAnd again, when I say healthy or unhealthy,\\n\\nI mean, are you over-breathing?\\n\\nAre you under-breathing?\\n\\nAre you delivering the appropriate ratios\\n\\nof oxygen and carbon dioxide\\n\\nto the tissues of your brain and body?\\n\\nIn order to do this, we're going to do a simple test.\\n\\nAgain, please don't do this while driving\\n\\nor operating heavy machinery or near water of any kind.\\n\\nBut assuming that you're not doing any of those things,\\n\\nI encourage you to sit down.\\n\\nCertainly not lie down, but just sit down.\\n\\nI suppose you also could do it standing.\\n\\nAnd we are going to do what's called\\n\\nthe carbon dioxide tolerance test.\\n\\nThe carbon dioxide tolerance test\\n\\nis a sort of back of the envelope measure\\n\\nof how well you are managing carbon dioxide.\\n\\nThat is how well you can control your breathing\\n\\nat both the mechanical and the chemical level.\\n\\nIt's a very simple test.\\n\\nWhat you're going to do is for the next 10 seconds or so\\n\\nwhile I'm speaking, you're just going to breathe normally.\\n\\nNow, again and again throughout this episode,\\n\\nI'm going to encourage you to be a nasal breather\\n\\nwhenever possible.\\n\\nBut of course there are instances\\n\\nin which you want to engage mouth breathing.\\n\\nBut for the time being, as I continue to blab on\\n\\nfor the next few seconds, just inhale through your nose,\\n\\nexhale through your nose.\\n\\nYou don't have to deliberately slow your breathing\\n\\nor increase the cadence of your breathing.\\n\\nHowever, in that time, you're also going to want to find\\n\\nsome sort of time measuring device,\\n\\nlike it could be your phone or it could be a stopwatch.\\n\\nWhat I'm going to ask you to do in a few minutes\\n\\nis I'm going to ask you to inhale through your nose\\n\\nas deeply as you possibly can.\\n\\nThat is you're going to fill your lungs\\n\\nas much as you can through your nose\\n\\nand then start a timer and measure how long it takes\\n\\nfor you to deliberately control that exhale\\n\\nuntil your lungs are empty.\\n\\nSo this is going to be a controlled exhale\\n\\nthrough the nose after a big deep breath.\\n\\nBut for the time being, keep breathing\\n\\nat a kind of calm, regular cadence.\\n\\nSo you can find that time measuring device now\\n\\nor you can come back to it later if you like.\\n\\nWhen I say inhale, you're going to inhale as deeply\\n\\nas you can through your nose,\\n\\nremembering that the diaphragm can really help you here\\n\\nto get a deep inhale by having your belly move out\\n\\nwhile you inhale.\\n\\nAnd then when I say start,\\n\\nyou're going to measure the time that it takes\\n\\nto do a complete lungs empty exhale.\\n\\nIn fact, I'll measure it for you.\\n\\nThis will be one of the rare instances in this podcast\\n\\nwhere there's going to be a long period of silence\\n\\nas I measure something.\\n\\nSo I've got a stopwatch here.\\n\\nSo please prepare to do the big inhale\\n\\nand start inhaling now.\\n\\nSo inhale as deeply as you can through your nose,\\n\\nfill your lungs as much as you can.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nNow start, meaning slowly control the exhale\\n\\nthrough your nose.\\n\\nYou're trying to let that air out as slowly as possible.\\n\\nAnd I'm just going to call out every 10 or 15 seconds or so.\\n\\nAnd you want to note when your lungs are empty.\\n\\nI know you can hold your breath with your lungs empty.\\n\\nThat is not an accurate measure, 15 seconds.\\n\\nIt is important that you note when your lungs are empty\\n\\nand that you're trying to control the exhale\\n\\nas much as possible so that you don't arrive\\n\\nat that lungs empty time too quickly.\\n\\nI'll explain what too quickly means.\\n\\n30 seconds.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nFor those of you that have already reached lungs empty,\\n\\nplease go back to breathing normally.\\n\\nFor those of you that haven't,\\n\\nyou can hang in here a little longer.\\n\\nIf you're still discarding that air, 45 seconds.\\n\\nAnd we're rounding toward a minute, not quite there.\\n\\nSome of you are probably still letting out that air.\\n\\nI want to point out none of this has to do\\n\\nwith cardiovascular fitness level,\\n\\nat least not in any kind of direct way.\\n\\nAnd 60 seconds.\\n\\nAnd I realized there will be a small subset of you out there\\n\\nthat are still exhaling your air in a slow lungs,\\n\\nslow exhale manner through the nose.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nSo what we just did is a back of the envelope\\n\\ncarbon dioxide discard rate, okay?\\n\\nIf you need to pause this and go back and try it again,\\n\\nyou just want to time how long it takes you\\n\\nto go from lungs full to lungs empty.\\n\\nAgain, with the full understanding,\\n\\nI know that you can all sit there like beasts\\n\\nand hold your breath with your lungs empty,\\n\\nbut please don't do that\\n\\nbecause that's not going to be informative\\n\\nfor what I'm telling you now.\\n\\nWhat I'm going to tell you now\\n\\nis that if it took you 20 seconds or less\\n\\nto expel all your air,\\n\\nthat is you couldn't extend that exhale\\n\\nlonger than 20 seconds,\\n\\nin a kind of back of the envelope way,\\n\\nwe can say that you have a relatively brief\\n\\nor low carbon dioxide tolerance, okay?\\n\\nIf it took you somewhere between 25 and 40,\\n\\nmaybe 45 seconds to expel all your air,\\n\\nthat is you could control that exhale\\n\\nfor about 45 seconds or 30 seconds,\\n\\nthen you have a moderate level of carbon dioxide tolerance.\\n\\nAnd if, for instance, you were able to go 50 seconds\\n\\nor longer for that discard until you hit lungs empty,\\n\\nyou have a fairly high degree of carbon dioxide tolerance.\\n\\nNow, here's the deal.\\n\\nIf you had low carbon dioxide tolerance,\\n\\nthat is your 20 seconds or less,\\n\\nyou're going to write down the number three, okay?\\n\\nIf you had moderate levels of carbon dioxide tolerance,\\n\\nyou're going to write down the number five,\\n\\nor you could even put five to six.\\n\\nAnd then if you are in that bracket of people\\n\\nthat was able to discard your air\\n\\nover a period of 50 seconds or more,\\n\\nyou're going to write down the number eight to 10, okay?\\n\\nNow, what are these numbers?\\n\\nWhat are we talking about?\\n\\nAnd before we get into what to do with these numbers,\\n\\nI want to emphasize again,\\n\\nthis does not have to do with fitness level per se.\\n\\nI know some world-class triathletes\\n\\nthat have very fast carbon dioxide blow-off times,\\n\\nthat is their discard rates are 20 seconds or less.\\n\\nI should also point out that if you're very stressed,\\n\\nthat number is going to be very small.\\n\\nIf you're very relaxed,\\n\\nlike you just woke up after a long night of sleep\\n\\nand you feel great, that number is going to be extended,\\n\\nokay?\\n\\nSo this is a back of the envelope measure\\n\\nthat you're going to use each time you decide to do\\n\\nthe exercise I'm going to tell you about in a moment.\\n\\nAnd the exercise I'm going to tell you about in a moment\\n\\ncan be done every day if you like,\\n\\nbut what the most interesting studies,\\n\\nat least to me, indicate is that you could do the exercise\\n\\nI'll tell you about even just once or twice a week\\n\\nand greatly improve your efficiency of breathing\\n\\nand shift yourself away from over-breathing when at rest,\\n\\neven if you're not thinking\\n\\nabout how you're breathing at rest.\\n\\nOkay, so what is this exercise?\\n\\nWell, you just got your number,\\n\\neither low, medium or high bracket number\\n\\nfor carbon dioxide discard rate.\\n\\nRemember, if you're in the low category, your number is three.\\n\\nIf you're medium, it's five to six.\\n\\nAnd if you are in the long carbon dioxide discard rate,\\n\\nlong duration carbon dioxide discard rate,\\n\\nthat is eight to 10 is your number.\\n\\nNow you're going to do two minutes\\n\\nof what most people would call box breathing.\\n\\nWhat is box breathing?\\n\\nBox breathing are equal duration, inhale, hold,\\n\\nexhale, hold, repeat.\\n\\nSo inhale, hold, exhale, hold.\\n\\nSounds very easy, right?\\n\\nHow long do you inhale and then hold, exhale and then hold?\\n\\nWell, you now know,\\n\\nif you were in the low group of carbon dioxide discard rate,\\n\\nyour inhale is going to be three seconds,\\n\\nyour hold will be three seconds,\\n\\nyour exhale will be three seconds,\\n\\nand then you repeat three seconds.\\n\\nSo each size of the box, if you will,\\n\\nis going to be three seconds long.\\n\\nIf you were in the moderate carbon dioxide\\n\\ndiscard rate category,\\n\\nthen you're going to inhale for five to six seconds,\\n\\nhold for five to six, exhale for five to six,\\n\\nhold for five to six, repeat for about two minutes.\\n\\nYou could do three minutes if you want,\\n\\nbut I think it's important to have protocols\\n\\nthat are feasible for most people.\\n\\nAnd that's going to mean doing things\\n\\nfor about two to five minutes\\n\\nwhen it comes to these breath rehabilitation exercises\\n\\nfor restoring normal breathing.\\n\\nAnd then of course, if you were in the long category\\n\\nof carbon dioxide discard rate,\\n\\nyou should be able to do an eight to 10 second inhale,\\n\\neight to 10 second hold, eight to 10 second exhale,\\n\\neight to 10 second hold and repeat, okay?\\n\\nSo you could do that exercise now if you like,\\n\\nor you could do it at some point offline.\\n\\nYou can pause this podcast if you want and go try it.\\n\\nThat's an exercise that you can do\\n\\nfor about two to three minutes, once or twice per week.\\n\\nWhat's happening when you do that exercise?\\n\\nWell, first of all, you are greatly increasing\\n\\nyour neuro-mechanical control over the diaphragm.\\n\\nThis is very important.\\n\\nMost people are not aware of this phrenic nerve pathway\\n\\nin the diaphragm, and you're greatly increasing\\n\\nyour mechanical control over this pathway\\n\\nthrough the process we call neuroplasticity.\\n\\nWhen you deliberately focus on a aspect\\n\\nof your nervous system control,\\n\\nin particular nervous system control over musculature\\n\\nthat normally is subconscious\\n\\nand you're not paying attention to,\\n\\nand when you actively take control of that,\\n\\nit requires that your brain adjust and rewire\\n\\nthe relationship between the different components\\n\\nof that circuit.\\n\\nAnd the wonderful thing is that has been shown\\n\\nto lead to changes in your resting pattern of breathing.\\n\\nNow, why did we go through the whole business\\n\\nof doing the carbon dioxide tolerance test?\\n\\nWell, for people who don't tolerate carbon dioxide\\n\\nvery well, they don't have very good phrenic,\\n\\nthat is neuro-mechanical control of the diaphragm\\n\\nfor whatever reason.\\n\\nAgain, it doesn't mean you're not fit.\\n\\nIt just means you don't have,\\n\\nor you have not yet developed\\n\\nneuro-mechanical control of the diaphragm.\\n\\nIt would be near impossible for you to do box breathing\\n\\nfor two or three minutes with eight seconds in,\\n\\neight seconds hold, eight seconds exhale, eight second hold.\\n\\nSo that's why we do a test\\n\\nto see what you're capable of doing.\\n\\nYou don't want the box breathing to be too strained\\n\\nwhere you're really challenged to get around the whole box.\\n\\nYou want it to be relatively easy\\n\\nbecause remember you're trying to translate this pattern\\n\\nto your normal pattern of breathing.\\n\\nThat is your pattern of breathing\\n\\nwhen you're not consciously thinking about breathing.\\n\\nAnd what are we really translating\\n\\nwhen we do this box breathing type exercise?\\n\\nWhat you're translating is the ability\\n\\nto pause between breaths and yet take full,\\n\\nmechanically driven breaths\\n\\nthat involve the phrenic nerve and diaphragm.\\n\\nSo again, you're encouraging,\\n\\nespecially if you use nasal breathing\\n\\nwhen you do the box breathing,\\n\\nyou're encouraging phrenic control over the diaphragm\\n\\nand you're getting that six liters of air per minute or so\\n\\nusing fewer and fewer breaths over time.\\n\\nSo this is a, again, zero cost,\\n\\nalthough it does cost a little bit of time,\\n\\nzero cost approach to adjusting your normal pattern\\n\\nof breathing at rest,\\n\\nwhich has a huge number of positive outcomes\\n\\nin terms of your ability to stay relatively calm,\\n\\nto not get the hyper excitability of the brain.\\n\\nIt has actually been shown in various studies,\\n\\nand we'll talk about one in particular later,\\n\\nto greatly improve not just levels of calm\\n\\nand reduce bouts of stress,\\n\\nbut also improve nighttime sleep.\\n\\nThere are a huge number of benefits\\n\\nthat can come from doing this box breathing exercise,\\n\\nbut you got to get the duration\\n\\nof the sides of the box right.\\n\\nAnd that's why you do the carbon dioxide tolerance test.\\n\\nOne thing that many people notice\\n\\nafter doing the carbon dioxide tolerance test,\\n\\neven just once,\\n\\nand then doing this box breathing exercise\\n\\nonce or twice a week,\\n\\nis that after two or three weeks,\\n\\nthe box breathing itself becomes very easy.\\n\\nAnd in that case,\\n\\nI recommend taking the carbon dioxide tolerance test\\n\\nover again.\\n\\nAnd almost always what you'll find\\n\\nis that you have been able to extend\\n\\nyour carbon dioxide discard rate,\\n\\nand therefore you now fall into a different category,\\n\\nnot just the lower medium,\\n\\nbut the long carbon dioxide discard rate category,\\n\\nand you are able to extend the duration\\n\\nof those inhale hold, exhale holds\\n\\nduring the box breathing.\\n\\nAnd of course, the ultimate benefit of all this\\n\\nis that it translates to deeper\\n\\nand yet less frequent breathing when at rest\\n\\nand when not consciously paying attention\\n\\nto how you're breathing during the daytime.\\n\\nAgain, if at all possible,\\n\\ndo all of this breathing through the nose.\\n\\nFor those of you that have a severely occluded nose,\\n\\nthe recommendation always is to breathe\\n\\nthrough your nose more.\\n\\nBut I do realize that for some people,\\n\\nit's really uncomfortable to breathe through the nose\\n\\nbecause they have such an occluded nasal pathway.\\n\\nAnd for you folks,\\n\\ndoing some of this breathing through the mouth\\n\\ncan probably suffice,\\n\\nbut if at all possible, do the breathing through the nose.\\n\\nAnd please also let me know how your progress\\n\\nevolves over time with the carbon dioxide discard rate\\n\\nand the box breathing.\\n\\nAnd of course, the positive shifts that occur\\n\\nin normal unconscious daytime breathing\\n\\ntranslate to all the opposite things\\n\\nthat we talked about when you are over breathing\\n\\nduring the daytime.\\n\\nSo what I just described\\n\\nin terms of the carbon dioxide tolerance test\\n\\nand the exercise using box breathing\\n\\nto restore normal patterns of breathing\\n\\nand not over breathe\\n\\nand therefore not eliminate too much carbon dioxide\\n\\nis exactly the two tests that were incorporated\\n\\ninto a study that my laboratory did in collaboration\\n\\nwith our associate chair of psychiatry\\n\\nat Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. David Spiegel,\\n\\nwho's also been a guest on this podcast previously.\\n\\nAnd that study explored box breathing,\\n\\nbut it also explored other forms of breathing\\n\\nand actually compared those forms of deliberate breathing\\n\\nto meditation as a means to explore\\n\\nwhat are going to be the minimal effective doses\\n\\nand most effective ways to chronically reduce stress\\n\\naround the clock and improve mood and improve sleep.\\n\\nSo the study I'm referring to was just published recently.\\n\\nIt's entitled Brief Structured Respiration Practices\\n\\nEnhance Mood and Reduce Physiological Arousal.\\n\\nWe will also provide a link to this paper\\n\\nin the show note captions.\\n\\nWhat this study really focused on was a simple question,\\n\\nwhich is what is the shortest and most effective practice\\n\\nthat people can use in order to reduce their levels\\n\\nof stress, not just during that breath work practice\\n\\nor meditation practice, but around the clock,\\n\\n24 hours a day, including improvements in sleep.\\n\\nAnd we were excited to do this study\\n\\nbecause many studies had explored how meditation\\n\\nor in some cases, fewer studies had explored\\n\\nhow breath work can impact different brain states\\n\\nor bodily states, but very few studies had explored\\n\\nhow those breath work or meditation practices\\n\\ninfluenced body brain states around the clock\\n\\nwhen people were not performing the particular meditation\\n\\nor breath work practice.\\n\\nThe reason we were able to do this study\\n\\nwas really fortunate.\\n\\nThe folks over at Whoop were generous enough\\n\\nto donate a bunch of Whoop straps,\\n\\nwhich allowed us to measure heart rate variability,\\n\\na number of other different physiological parameters.\\n\\nWe also got subjective reports about people's mood\\n\\nand feelings of wellbeing.\\n\\nWe got data about their sleep pinged to us\\n\\nfrom remote locations.\\n\\nSo these people, rather than being brought to the laboratory\\n\\nand being in a very artificial circumstance,\\n\\nthe laboratory, as much as we like to think\\n\\nour laboratory is realistic, we have virtual reality\\n\\nand things like that, there's nothing as realistic\\n\\nas the real world.\\n\\nAnd so we were able to have more than 100 subjects\\n\\nout in the real world, living their real lives,\\n\\npinging back to us data all the time, 24 hours a day,\\n\\nso that we could measure how their different interventions\\n\\nthat we asked them to do, breath work practices\\n\\nor meditation practices,\\n\\nwere impacting physiological parameters,\\n\\nand they were also informing us regularly\\n\\nabout their subjective mood, et cetera.\\n\\nWe got a lot of data, as you can imagine,\\n\\nand the basic takeaway from the study was twofold.\\n\\nFirst of all, we discovered\\n\\nthat deliberate breath work practices done\\n\\nfor about five minutes per day\\n\\nacross the course of about a month,\\n\\nled to greater reductions in stress\\n\\nthan did a five minute a day meditation practice.\\n\\nNow, that is not to say that meditation is not useful.\\n\\nIn fact, there are dozens, if not hundreds of papers,\\n\\nincluding one particular, I should say,\\n\\nparticularly beautiful study from Wendy Suzuki's lab\\n\\nat New York University showing\\n\\nthat a daily 10 to 13 minute mindfulness meditation practice\\n\\ncan greatly improve focus, memory,\\n\\nand a number of other things related\\n\\nto cognition and learning.\\n\\nHowever, the research on meditation has shown us\\n\\nthat meditation, at least short meditations,\\n\\nmainly lead to improvements in focus and memory,\\n\\nnot so much reductions in stress,\\n\\nalthough they do lead to reductions in stress.\\n\\nWhat we found was that any number\\n\\nof different breath work practices,\\n\\nand we explored three, done for five minutes a day,\\n\\noutperformed meditation in terms of the ability\\n\\nof breath work to reduce stress around the clock\\n\\ncompared to meditation.\\n\\nThe three types of breath work that we explored\\n\\nalso showed different effects.\\n\\nI should mention the three types of breath work\\n\\nthat we compared were box breathing\\n\\nof the sort that you just learned about.\\n\\nWe compared that to something called cyclic sighing,\\n\\nwhich involves two inhales through the nose\\n\\nto get maximally inflated lungs followed by a long exhale.\\n\\nI'll return to that in a moment.\\n\\nThat was repeated for five minutes at a time\\n\\nfor each session.\\n\\nAnd a third breath work practice,\\n\\nwhich was cyclic hyperventilation,\\n\\nwhich as the name suggests,\\n\\ninvolves people inhaling deeply through the nose,\\n\\nthen exhaling passively through the mouth,\\n\\nand then repeating inhale through the nose,\\n\\nexhale through the mouth,\\n\\nrepeating that for 25 cycles,\\n\\none cycle being an inhale and an exhale.\\n\\nSo that equals one cycle.\\n\\nRepeat that for 25 cycles,\\n\\nthen exhaling all their air\\n\\nand holding their breath with lungs empty\\n\\nfor about 15 to 30 seconds,\\n\\nand then repeating inhale, exhale,\\n\\ncyclic hyperventilation for the duration of five minutes.\\n\\nOkay, so people were divided into these different groups,\\n\\neither mindfulness meditation where they sat,\\n\\nthey were not told to control their breathing\\n\\nin any specific way, they closed their eyes,\\n\\nthey focused their attention\\n\\non a region just behind their forehead.\\n\\nOne group did that, the other group did cyclic sighing,\\n\\nanother group did box breathing,\\n\\nanother group did cyclic hyperventilation.\\n\\nAs any sort of clinical trial like this ought to,\\n\\nwe then swapped people into different groups,\\n\\nso they served as their own control,\\n\\nso we could evaluate any between\\n\\nand within individual variability.\\n\\nAgain, there are a lot of data in this paper,\\n\\nbut the takeaway was that for the sake\\n\\nof stress reduction around the clock,\\n\\nand for the sake of improving sleep and mood,\\n\\nthe most effective practice of the four practices\\n\\nthat we examined was the cyclic sighing.\\n\\nAgain, cyclic sighing is performed the following way,\\n\\nyou inhale through the nose as deeply as you can,\\n\\nthen you do a second inhale immediately afterwards\\n\\nto try and maximally inflate the lungs,\\n\\nin fact, that's what happens,\\n\\nwe know that during that second inhale,\\n\\neven if it's just a very sharp short inhale,\\n\\nthe extra physical vigor that's required\\n\\nto generate that second inhale\\n\\ncauses those avioli of the lungs,\\n\\nwhich may have collapsed and indeed in between breaths,\\n\\nand often even just through the course of the day,\\n\\nand especially if we get stressed,\\n\\nthose avioli of the lungs start to collapse,\\n\\nand because they're damp on the inside,\\n\\nthey have a little bit of fluid,\\n\\nthey're like a balloon with a little bit of fluid\\n\\nin the middle, it takes a little bit of physical force\\n\\nto pop those open,\\n\\nnow you're not literally exploding them pop,\\n\\nbut you're re-inflating them with air,\\n\\nand then you perform the long exhale through the mouth\\n\\nuntil lungs are empty, so it looks exactly like this.\\n\\nNow, we know that one single physiological sigh\\n\\nof the sort that I just described,\\n\\nperformed at any time of day, under any conditions,\\n\\nwhether or not you're about to walk on stage to give a talk,\\n\\nor you're in a meeting and you're feeling stressed,\\n\\nor you're in a conversation that's very stressful,\\n\\nor you can feel stress mounting because you're in traffic,\\n\\nor any number of psychological or physical stressors\\n\\nthat may be approaching you or you feel are oppressing you,\\n\\ndoing one physiological sigh\\n\\nof the sort that I just described,\\n\\nis the fastest physiologically verified way\\n\\nthat we are aware of to reduce your levels of stress\\n\\nand to reintroduce calm,\\n\\nthat is to shift your autonomic nervous system\\n\\nfrom a state of heightened levels of autonomic arousal\\n\\nthat is sympathetic nervous system as it's called,\\n\\nis at a higher activation level\\n\\nthan the so-called parasympathetic nervous system.\\n\\nAgain, sympathetic nervous system,\\n\\nhaving nothing to do with sympathy,\\n\\nhas everything to do with so-called fight or flight,\\n\\nalthough it controls other things too,\\n\\nincluding positive arousal.\\n\\nAnd the parasympathetic nervous system,\\n\\noften referred to as the rest and digest system,\\n\\nalthough it does other things too,\\n\\nis associated with calming.\\n\\nThose two things are always in kind of push-pull\\n\\nwith one another, like a seesaw or push-pull,\\n\\nhowever you want to think about it.\\n\\nOne physiological sigh, meaning that big deep inhale,\\n\\nshort second inhale, also through the nose,\\n\\nand then long exhale to completely lungs empty,\\n\\nis known to restore the level of balance\\n\\nin the sympathetic parasympathetic neural circuitries\\n\\nand is the fastest way to reintroduce calm.\\n\\nThat's one physiological sigh.\\n\\nIn this study, what we asked was that people perform\\n\\nthat repeatedly, so-called cyclic sighing\\n\\nfor the duration of five minutes.\\n\\nAnd the people who did that cyclic sighing\\n\\nfor five minutes a day,\\n\\nregardless of the time of day that they did it,\\n\\nexperienced the greatest reductions in stress,\\n\\nnot just during the practice, but around the 24-hour cycle.\\n\\nAnd it translated, again,\\n\\nto all sorts of positive subjective changes,\\n\\nimprovements in sleep, lower resting heart rate\\n\\nat all times of day.\\n\\nSo this is important.\\n\\nAgain, this study was not just exploring what happens\\n\\nduring meditation or breath work, cyclic sighing, et cetera.\\n\\nIt was exploring how the changes that occur\\n\\nduring that practice translate to changes in breathing\\n\\nand heart rate, mood, et cetera, throughout the 24-hour cycle.\\n\\nSo the takeaway here is twofold.\\n\\nFirst of all, if you're somebody who wants\\n\\nto improve your mood and reduce your overall levels\\n\\nof stress, and you only have five minutes a day\\n\\nto invest in that, hopefully you're doing\\n\\nall the other things like trying to get proper sleep\\n\\nand exercise, social connection, nutrition, et cetera,\\n\\nsunlight in the morning, of course, can't leave that out.\\n\\nBut if you were going to devote five minutes a day\\n\\nto a stress reduction practice that is now supported\\n\\nby data to translate to reductions in stress\\n\\naround the clock, the data say that you would want\\n\\nto invest that in cyclic sighing.\\n\\nThat is double inhale through the nose,\\n\\nextended exhale through the mouth\\n\\nuntil your lungs are empty,\\n\\nthen repeat for five minutes a day.\\n\\nYou, of course, if you like, could do meditation.\\n\\nIt still had positive effects, meaning it reduced stress,\\n\\nalthough not as much as cyclic sighing.\\n\\nYou could do box breathing if you want\\n\\nfor the purpose of reducing stress.\\n\\nAll the practices we explored did reduce stress,\\n\\nbut cyclic sighing performed for five minutes a day\\n\\nhad the most robust and pervasive effect\\n\\nin reducing stress, improving mood, and improving sleep.\\n\\nThat's the first message of the study.\\n\\nThe second takeaway is that one physiological sigh,\\n\\nthat's right, just one physiological sigh,\\n\\nwhere you inhale deeply through the nose,\\n\\nanother inhale through the nose\\n\\nto maximally inflate the oviola, the lungs,\\n\\nand then you exhale to completely lungs empty\\n\\nand then go back to normal breathing,\\n\\nis the fastest way to introduce a level of calm\\n\\nand to reduce your overall levels of stress in real time.\\n\\nAnd this is very important.\\n\\nI think that out there these days,\\n\\nwe hear a lot about stress reduction techniques\\n\\nand most all of the stress reduction techniques\\n\\nthat have been explored,\\n\\neverything from massage to meditation to breath work,\\n\\nto a hot shower, to a foot rub will calm you down.\\n\\nThe question is, do they calm you down\\n\\njust during that practice?\\n\\nGreat if it does,\\n\\nbut does it also translate to reduce levels of stress\\n\\nat other times in the 24 hour cycle\\n\\nand other positive effects as well?\\n\\nSo one physiological sigh is a very efficient way\\n\\nto adjust that ratio of sympathetic\\n\\nto parasympathetic activation\\n\\nand immediately bring about calm.\\n\\nSo it's excellent for real time control of stress.\\n\\nThe other thing about physiological sigh\\n\\nis that it's not a hack.\\n\\nIt's not the application of a breathing practice\\n\\nto something that it wasn't intended for.\\n\\nIn fact, physiological sigh were not discovered by me at all.\\n\\nThey were discovered by physiologists in the 1930s\\n\\nwho found that when people under breathe,\\n\\nthey have a buildup of carbon dioxide in their system.\\n\\nAnd even though carbon dioxide is essential for life,\\n\\nyou don't want too much of it in your system.\\n\\nAnd that people, whether or not they were asleep or awake\\n\\nwould engage a physiological sigh\\n\\nspontaneously subconsciously.\\n\\nThey would do this double inhale through the nose\\n\\nand extended exhale through the mouth.\\n\\nAnd that did not just eliminate\\n\\nexcessive carbon dioxide from the system.\\n\\nIt also rebalanced the oxygen carbon dioxide ratio\\n\\nin the proper ways.\\n\\nIn fact, it's observed in animals.\\n\\nYou might see this in animals that are tired.\\n\\nWhen animals or humans get tired,\\n\\nthey tend to start under breathing a little bit.\\n\\nAnd that can often disrupt the balance\\n\\nof carbon dioxide and oxygen.\\n\\nAnd right before a dog will go down for a nap,\\n\\nfor instance, you'll notice\\n\\nthat he'll do this double inhale exhale.\\n\\nPeople, when they are sleeping,\\n\\nif they hold their breath for a period of time,\\n\\nwhich frankly all of us do periodically throughout sleep,\\n\\nthey will engage a spontaneous physiological sigh.\\n\\nDuring the daytime, we are often holding our breath,\\n\\nespecially nowadays.\\n\\nAnd there's a study on this\\n\\nthat we'll talk about a little bit later\\n\\nwhere when people text message or they're emailing,\\n\\nalthough nowadays people are mainly on social media\\n\\nand text messaging, they often are holding their breath.\\n\\nThey will follow a breath hold by a physiological sigh\\n\\nbecause during that breath hold,\\n\\nthey're building up the level of carbon dioxide\\n\\nin their system.\\n\\nNow mind you, I spent close to a half an hour\\n\\ntelling you that most people are over breathing at rest.\\n\\nAnd that's also true.\\n\\nBut people often will shift from over breathing\\n\\nto under breathing, which is a terrible pattern.\\n\\nSo physiological sigh is done either as a one-off,\\n\\none physiological sigh to clamp stress\\n\\nor reduce stress in real time,\\n\\nor repeatedly over five minutes\\n\\nas a practice that you do each day\\n\\nis going to be not just the most effective way\\n\\nto approach reducing stress around the clock\\n\\nand in real time,\\n\\nbut also the one that's highly compatible\\n\\nwith the way that the neural circuits\\n\\nthat control breathing were designed.\\n\\nThe physiological sigh\\n\\nhas some other very useful applications.\\n\\nOne of the more, I would say useful ones,\\n\\nat least to those of you that exercise\\n\\nis going to be the use of physiological sigh\\n\\nin order to remove the so-called side stitch.\\n\\nSo if you've ever been running or swimming or exercising,\\n\\nyou felt a cramp on your right side,\\n\\nchances are,\\n\\ndespite what your high school PE coach told you,\\n\\nthat raising your arms above your head\\n\\nor drinking less water before you exercise\\n\\nis not going to get rid of that cramp.\\n\\nAnd here's why, it's not a cramp at all.\\n\\nIf you recall the cervical three, four, and five nerves\\n\\nthat give rise to the phrenic nerve\\n\\nand go down and innervate your diaphragm,\\n\\nwell, as I mentioned before,\\n\\na certain number of those nerve fibers\\n\\nactually course into the diaphragm and go up underneath.\\n\\nAnd if you recall earlier,\\n\\nI also said that the diaphragm sits right on top\\n\\nof the liver.\\n\\nIn other words, you actually have sensory innervation\\n\\nof the diaphragm, the deep diaphragm,\\n\\nand the liver.\\n\\nAnd there's something called a referenced pain,\\n\\nwhich is what people generally experience\\n\\nwhen they have that side stitch on their right-hand side.\\n\\nSo if you're ever exercising\\n\\nand you feel a cramp on your right-hand side,\\n\\nit's possible that it's a genuine cramp,\\n\\nbut more likely is the fact\\n\\nthat that phrenic nerve sensory innervation\\n\\nis now being carried up to your brain\\n\\nand you are detecting some local or referenced pain\\n\\nin the liver and in the diaphragm.\\n\\nNow that doesn't necessarily mean you're doing anything\\n\\nwrong, although you might not be breathing properly\\n\\nfor running at that moment.\\n\\nAnd that's what gave rise to it.\\n\\nIt could be some spasming of the phrenic nerve\\n\\nor some inefficient breathing during running.\\n\\nWe had an entire series on fitness with Dr. Andy Galpin.\\n\\nOne of those episodes included a lot of information\\n\\non breathing.\\n\\nIt was the episode on endurance,\\n\\nalthough breathing was a topic that was thread\\n\\nthrough multiple episodes in that series.\\n\\nYou can find that series at hubermanlab.com.\\n\\nTalks a lot about how to breathe during running,\\n\\nhow to breathe during weightlifting, et cetera.\\n\\nBut the point for now is that if ever you're experiencing\\n\\nthat right side side stitch,\\n\\nI encourage you to perform the physiological sigh.\\n\\nAnd the good news is you can perform it while still running\\n\\nor while still swimming,\\n\\nalthough I suppose with swimming,\\n\\nyou might have to make some adjustments\\n\\nbecause of course you don't want to inhale water\\n\\nor while cycling or any type of activity.\\n\\nIf you'd perform that physiological sigh,\\n\\ngenerally two or three times,\\n\\nwhat will occur is that because of changes\\n\\nin the firing of the phrenic nerve,\\n\\nand in particular because of changes in the sensory feedback\\n\\nfrom the sensory component of the phrenic nerve\\n\\nback to the brain,\\n\\nyou will experience an alleviation of the pain\\n\\nfrom that right side side stitch.\\n\\nIn other words, you can get rid of side cramps\\n\\ndoing physiological sighs during activities,\\n\\nin particular during running activities.\\n\\nNow I should also mention that if you're experiencing\\n\\na side stitch on the left side,\\n\\nchances are that has to do with excessive air\\n\\nor fluid in your stomach.\\n\\nAnd there are reasons for that that also have to do\\n\\nwith the way that the phrenic nerve is bilateral\\n\\nand branches to both sides\\n\\nand is catching sensory input on the left side\\n\\nfrom some of the local organs\\n\\nand sensory innervation of those organs.\\n\\nOkay, but if you have right side side stitch,\\n\\nthe physiological sigh done two or three times\\n\\nwhile still running ought to relieve that side stitch.\\n\\nNow, as long as we're talking about breathing\\n\\nand the phrenic nerve and the relationship\\n\\nbetween the phrenic nerve and your liver and your stomach\\n\\nand some of the other organs in that neighborhood,\\n\\nwe should talk about the relationship\\n\\nbetween breathing and heart rate.\\n\\nThis is an incredibly important topic,\\n\\nso much so that I perhaps should have brought it up\\n\\nat the beginning of the episode,\\n\\nbut nonetheless, you now know what your diaphragm does.\\n\\nWhen you inhale, your diaphragm moves down.\\n\\nThat's right, when you can track your diaphragm,\\n\\nit moves down, it creates space for your lungs to inhale.\\n\\nAnd when you exhale, your diaphragm moves up.\\n\\nWell, when you inhale and your diaphragm moves down,\\n\\nwhat happens is there's more space created\\n\\nin the thoracic cavity,\\n\\nand particularly if you're also breathing deeply\\n\\nand you're using those intercostal muscles\\n\\nto expand your ribs.\\n\\nAs a consequence, the heart actually gets\\n\\na little bit bigger.\\n\\nIt's a temporary enlargement in the heart,\\n\\nbut it's a real enlargement.\\n\\nAnd as a consequence, whatever blood is in the heart\\n\\nis now in a larger volume because the heart got bigger.\\n\\nAnd as a consequence, that blood is moving more slowly\\n\\nthrough that larger volume for a short period of time,\\n\\nbut nonetheless, it's moving more slowly.\\n\\nYour nervous system detects that\\n\\nand sends a neural signal to the heart\\n\\nto speed the heart rate up.\\n\\nIn other words, inhales increase heart rate.\\n\\nThe opposite is true when you exhale.\\n\\nWhen you exhale, your diaphragm moves up,\\n\\nyour rib cage tends to move inward a bit,\\n\\nand you compact the heart.\\n\\nYou reduce the volume of the heart overall.\\n\\nWhen you reduce the volume of the heart overall,\\n\\nblood flow through the heart accelerates\\n\\nbecause it's a smaller volume.\\n\\nSo given you know blood is gonna move more quickly\\n\\nthrough that small volume,\\n\\nyour nervous system detects that\\n\\nand sends a signal to slow the heart down.\\n\\nSo just as inhale speed the heart up,\\n\\nexhales slow your heart rate down.\\n\\nNow, of course, even though you can double up on inhales\\n\\nor even triple up on inhales,\\n\\nsooner or later, if you inhale,\\n\\nyou're gonna have to exhale, all right?\\n\\nAnd the converse is also true, of course.\\n\\nSo what does this mean\\n\\nin terms of controlling your heart rate?\\n\\nWell, let's say you are going in for a blood draw\\n\\nor you're going out on stage and you're stressed.\\n\\nWell, I would encourage you to do a physiological sigh,\\n\\nmaybe two physiological sighs,\\n\\nto bring your level of calm up\\n\\nand your level of stress down.\\n\\nNonetheless, if you have any reason\\n\\nwhy you want to quickly reduce your heart rate\\n\\nor accelerate your heart rate\\n\\nfor sake of physical work output\\n\\nor to calm yourself down additionally,\\n\\nnot just use the physiological sigh,\\n\\nwell, then you can take advantage of this relationship\\n\\nbetween inhales and exhales controlling heart rate.\\n\\nIf you want to increase your heart rate,\\n\\nyou can simply inhale longer and more vigorously\\n\\nrelative to your exhales.\\n\\nAnd if you want to decrease your heart rate,\\n\\nwell, then you're going to make your exhales longer\\n\\nand or more vigorous than your inhales.\\n\\nIn fact, this process,\\n\\nwhich is called respiratory sinus arrhythmia\\n\\nis the basis of what we call heart rate variability.\\n\\nHeart rate variability involves the vagus nerve,\\n\\nthe 10th cranial nerve, which is a parasympathetic nerve\\n\\nthat is associated with a calming aspect\\n\\nof the autonomic nervous system,\\n\\nslowing your heart rate down by extending your exhales.\\n\\nAnd it really forms the basis of most all breathing practices.\\n\\nIf you look at any breathing practices,\\n\\nwhether or not it's Wim Hof breathing,\\n\\nTummo breathing, Kundalini breathing, Pranayama breathing,\\n\\nphysiological sighing, cyclic sighing and on and on and on.\\n\\nIf you were to measure the ratio of inhales to exhales\\n\\nand the vigor of inhales to exhales,\\n\\nwhat you would find is that each one would create\\n\\na net increase or a net decrease in heart rate\\n\\nthat could be very accurately predicted\\n\\nby whether or not that breathing practice\\n\\nemphasized inhales, emphasized exhales,\\n\\nor had those two features inhale and exhale\\n\\nbe of equal duration and intensity.\\n\\nIn fact, if you wanted to equilibrate your heart rate,\\n\\nwhat you would do is you would do box breathing\\n\\nbecause inhale, hold, exhale, hold is by definition,\\n\\ncreating equal duration inhales and exhales\\n\\nof essentially equivalent vigor.\\n\\nWhen you do a physiological sigh,\\n\\nyou're doing two big inhales,\\n\\nwhich is going to speed your heart rate up just a little bit,\\n\\nbut then a long extended exhale.\\n\\nThe exhale in the end is much longer\\n\\nthan the two inhales even when combined.\\n\\nAnd so you get a net decrease in heart rate,\\n\\nthe calming effect.\\n\\nAnd then practices such as tumor breathing\\n\\nor Wim Hof breathing or cyclic hyperventilation,\\n\\ndeep inhales and exhales,\\n\\nor the inhales are more vigorous\\n\\ncompared to the more passive exhales\\n\\nare going to lead to increases in heart rate.\\n\\nOkay, so the relationship between breathing and heart rate\\n\\nis an absolutely lock step one\\n\\nwhere your heart rate follows your breathing.\\n\\nYour heart rate and your breathing\\n\\nare in an intimate discussion with one another,\\n\\nbut where always and forever,\\n\\nyour inhales increase your heart rate,\\n\\nyour exhales decrease it.\\n\\nNow this feature,\\n\\nwhich physicians call respiratory sinus arrhythmia,\\n\\nor we sometimes hear about more often nowadays\\n\\nas heart rate variability\\n\\nis something that people in sport\\n\\nhave known about for a very long time.\\n\\nIt's why, for instance,\\n\\nthat marksmen will exhale just prior to taking a shot.\\n\\nThat's particularly true for people\\n\\nthat compete in the biathlon,\\n\\nwhere they cross-country ski,\\n\\nso their heart rate is up, up, up, up, up,\\n\\nthen they'll get to the point\\n\\nwhere they actually have to shoot at a target\\n\\nand they'll exhale,\\n\\nand then they'll shoot at the target.\\n\\nThis is also why, for instance,\\n\\nif you want to bring your heart rate down very quickly\\n\\nbetween rounds of martial arts,\\n\\nthere are a number of different ways to do that,\\n\\nbut an extended exhale of any kind,\\n\\nor frankly, any breathing practice that emphasizes exhales\\n\\nis going to bring your heart rate down.\\n\\nThis has been incorporated\\n\\nin a number of different contexts,\\n\\nincluding sport, military.\\n\\nIt's also now being incorporated in the clinical context\\n\\nfor people who feel a panic attack coming on.\\n\\nI'm very gratified to learn that the physiological sigh\\n\\nis now being explored as a tool to prevent panic attacks\\n\\nand anxiety attacks.\\n\\nThis is prior to the panic attack,\\n\\npeople bringing their heart rate down again\\n\\nthrough those extended exhales.\\n\\nSo learning to extend your exhale\\n\\nis really a terrific skill to master,\\n\\nand it's a very easy skill to master, frankly.\\n\\nWhy do I say a skill?\\n\\nWell, remember what I said earlier,\\n\\nwhich is that humans inhale actively,\\n\\nand most typically will passively exhale,\\n\\njust let the air drop out of them at whatever rate,\\n\\ndepending on how much air they inhaled.\\n\\nActively exhaling, that is actively relaxing the diaphragm\\n\\nand actively relaxing those intercostal muscles of the chest,\\n\\nthose ones that are, I should say, between the ribs,\\n\\nis a skill that you can very quickly acquire\\n\\nand will allow you to use that relationship\\n\\nbetween the phrenic nerve, the diaphragm,\\n\\nthe size of the heart, the heart volume and all that stuff\\n\\nto really take control of heart rate quickly\\n\\nso that if you feel like your heart is racing too much,\\n\\nand frankly, a lot of people have a lot of\\n\\nwhat's called interoceptive awareness,\\n\\nespecially anxious people,\\n\\nthey can really sense what's going on in their body,\\n\\nother people less so, like,\\n\\noh my God, my heart's beating,\\n\\nit's ready to jump out of my chest,\\n\\nand I don't like that, I don't like that.\\n\\nBig, long exhale.\\n\\nDoesn't matter if you do it through the nose or the mouth,\\n\\nbig, long exhale is going to allow you\\n\\nto slow your heart rate down.\\n\\nLet's talk about hiccups.\\n\\nEverybody experiences hiccups from time to time.\\n\\nI think most people would agree\\n\\nthat one hiccup is sort of funny,\\n\\ntwo hiccups in a row is really funny,\\n\\nand three hiccups in a row\\n\\nis where it starts to be concerning,\\n\\nin part because hiccups can be kind of painful,\\n\\nand they experience pain in your gut or your lower abdomen,\\n\\nand sometimes in your chest as well,\\n\\nand it feels kind of intrusive,\\n\\nit gets in the way of having conversation\\n\\nor just sitting there and relaxing.\\n\\nFortunately, there's a simple way to get rid of hiccups,\\n\\nand you can arrive at that simple technique\\n\\nif you understand a little bit\\n\\nabout what gives rise to hiccups.\\n\\nThe reason we get hiccups at all\\n\\nis because we experience a spasm of the phrenic nerve.\\n\\nThe phrenic nerve, as you recall,\\n\\nis a nerve that emanates from the cervical region,\\n\\nto be specific, C, three, four, and five,\\n\\nthose spinal nerves go down, of course, behind the heart,\\n\\nand innervate the diaphragm, which is the muscle,\\n\\nthat when it contracts, it moves down,\\n\\nallows the lungs to fill,\\n\\nand then when you relax the diaphragm,\\n\\nthen the diaphragm moves up and the lungs shrink,\\n\\nor they expel air, so-called exhalation.\\n\\nNow, the phrenic nerve also has that sensory branch,\\n\\nso it's not just involved in controlling the diaphragm\\n\\nat the motor level,\\n\\nit's also sensing things deep within the diaphragm\\n\\nand in the liver as well,\\n\\nbecause the liver sits right below the diaphragm.\\n\\nSo a hiccup has that painful sensation from time to time\\n\\nbecause there's a rapid sensory feedback,\\n\\nor a signal rather,\\n\\nof a sharp kind of sensation of contraction\\n\\nwithin the diaphragm,\\n\\nand that's relayed back to the brain,\\n\\nand you consciously perceive that as a little bit of pain,\\n\\nand then, of course, the hiccup is the hiccup,\\n\\nwhich is the spasming of the phrenic nerve\\n\\nthat you experience more or less in your throat,\\n\\nbut all this really is happening along the phrenic nerve\\n\\nand toward the diaphragm.\\n\\nWhat this all means is that if you can stop\\n\\nthe phrenic nerve from spasming, you can stop hiccups.\\n\\nThere are a lot of approaches that people have tried to take\\n\\nto eliminate spasming of the phrenic nerve.\\n\\nYou'll hear that breathing into a bag,\\n\\nwhich is one way to re-ingest or re-inhale carbon dioxide\\n\\nthat otherwise would be expelled out\\n\\ninto the environment can help.\\n\\nThat's a very indirect method.\\n\\nIt rarely works, frankly,\\n\\nbecause it really has to do more\\n\\nwith adjusting your breathing\\n\\nto try and adjust the activity of the phrenic nerve.\\n\\nIt's a really roundabout way of trying to alleviate hiccups.\\n\\nSome people will experience relief\\n\\nfrom drinking from a glass of water\\n\\nfrom the opposite side of the glasses,\\n\\nor have to tilt over at the waist.\\n\\nIt's a kind of messy approach.\\n\\nAgain, it doesn't tend to work a lot of the time.\\n\\nFor some people, it works every time,\\n\\nbut for most people, it doesn't work at all.\\n\\nHowever, there is a technique\\n\\nthat can reliably eliminate hiccups,\\n\\nand it's a technique that takes advantage\\n\\nof hyper-contracting the phrenic nerve\\n\\nover a short period of time,\\n\\nso that it then subsequently relaxes\\n\\nor alleviates the spasming of the phrenic nerve.\\n\\nAnd that simple method is to inhale three times in a row.\\n\\nThis is a very unusual pattern of breathing,\\n\\nbut what it involves is taking a big, deep inhale\\n\\nthrough your nose.\\n\\nThen before you exhale any air,\\n\\ntake a second inhale through the nose,\\n\\nhowever brief that inhale might be,\\n\\nand then a third, even micro or millisecond long,\\n\\ninhale through your nose to get that third inhale,\\n\\nand then hold your breath for about 15 to 20 seconds,\\n\\nand then slowly exhale.\\n\\nSo even though I'm not experiencing any hiccups right now,\\n\\nI will demonstrate the method for eliminating hiccups\\n\\nso that you're all clear on how to do it.\\n\\nOkay, here I go.\\n\\nOkay, so it's three inhales all through the nose,\\n\\nand it is true that that second and third inhale\\n\\ntake some physical effort to really get additional air\\n\\ninto the lungs without exhaling first.\\n\\nIt feels like the only way I can describe it really\\n\\nis as a sharp second and third inhale,\\n\\nbecause you really have to engage the musculature\\n\\nof those intercostal muscles in the diaphragm\\n\\nin order to do it.\\n\\nAnd then that long exhale can be through the nose\\n\\nor the mouth, but I find it particularly relaxing\\n\\nor even pleasant to do it through the nose.\\n\\nThis method of three inhales through the nose\\n\\nfollowed by a long exhale through the nose or mouth\\n\\nwill eliminate hiccups right away,\\n\\nbecause what it does is it hyper-excites the phrenic nerve\\n\\nthree times in a row, a very unnatural pattern\\n\\nfor the phrenic nerve to fire.\\n\\nAnd then it undergoes a hyper-polarization, as we call it,\\n\\nin which the phrenic nerve actually stands\\n\\na much lower probability of getting activated again\\n\\nfor some period of time afterwards.\\n\\nSo it is important that you try and return\\n\\nto normal cadence of breathing\\n\\nafter doing this three inhales followed by the long exhale.\\n\\nIf you need to perform it a second time\\n\\nin order to eliminate hiccups,\\n\\nbecause they're simply not going away,\\n\\nthat's fine, you can do that.\\n\\nBut as far as we know, this is the most efficient\\n\\nand science-supported way to eliminate hiccups.\\n\\nNow, up until now, I've been talking\\n\\nabout breathing techniques,\\n\\nand I've mainly focused on breathing techniques\\n\\nthat emphasize the exhale,\\n\\nwhether or not it's the carbon dioxide tolerance test,\\n\\nwhether or not it's cyclic sighing\\n\\nor the physiological sigh that you use in real time\\n\\nto reduce stress.\\n\\nOne thing that we haven't talked about so much\\n\\nis cyclic hyperventilation.\\n\\nCyclic hyperventilation, as you recall,\\n\\nis a bout of 25 or so breaths,\\n\\ninhaling deeply through the nose\\n\\nand then passively exhaling,\\n\\nor sometimes actively exhaling, typically through the mouth.\\n\\nSo it might look like this.\\n\\nThat's a very active inhale through the nose\\n\\nand exhale through the mouth.\\n\\nIt can also be done, active inhale through the nose,\\n\\npassive exhale through the mouth, like so.\\n\\nIn any event, that pattern of breathing,\\n\\nrepeated for 10 to 25 breaths,\\n\\ngreatly increases levels of autonomic arousal.\\n\\nIn fact, it's known to deploy adrenaline from the adrenals.\\n\\nAnd in our study, we had people then expel all their air,\\n\\nso breathe out, hold their breath for 15 to 30 seconds,\\n\\nand then repeat for a period of five minutes.\\n\\nThat did lead to some very interesting\\n\\nand positive physiological changes\\n\\nin terms of stress mitigation,\\n\\nalthough not as significant as was observed\\n\\nwith cyclic sighing, as I talked about earlier.\\n\\nNow, there is a lot of interest\\n\\nin cyclic hyperventilation for sake of,\\n\\nfor instance, extending breath holds.\\n\\nThis has become popular in part\\n\\nbecause of the so-called Wim Hof method,\\n\\nwhich is a method that combines breathing,\\n\\ncyclic hyperventilation,\\n\\nfollowed by lungs full or lungs empty breath holds,\\n\\ndepending on which variant\\n\\nof the Wim Hof method one is using.\\n\\nSeparately, and I really want to emphasize separately,\\n\\nthe Wim Hof method also involves deliberate cold exposure,\\n\\nwhich as all of you know, I'm a big fan of,\\n\\nand we've done episodes of this podcast on,\\n\\nand we have toolkits on deliberate cold exposure\\n\\nfor increasing dopamine levels, epinephrine levels,\\n\\nimmune system function, et cetera.\\n\\nWim Hof method also incorporates that,\\n\\nand it has a mindfulness component.\\n\\nI do want to caution people\\n\\nthat anytime you're doing cyclic hyperventilation,\\n\\nyou want to be very cautious\\n\\nabout not doing it in or near water\\n\\nbecause it does greatly increase the risk\\n\\nof shallow water blackout.\\n\\nAnd that's because when you do cyclic hyperventilation,\\n\\nyou are expelling,\\n\\nyou're exhaling more carbon dioxide than usual.\\n\\nAnd what I haven't told you yet\\n\\nis that the trigger to breathe\\n\\nis actually an increase in carbon dioxide.\\n\\nWhat I mean by that is you have a small set of neurons\\n\\nin your brain stem that can detect\\n\\nwhen carbon dioxide levels in your bloodstream\\n\\nreach a certain level.\\n\\nAnd when they reach that level,\\n\\nthey trigger the gas reflex and or the hunger for breathing.\\n\\nIn other words, we don't breathe because we crave oxygen,\\n\\nalthough we do need oxygen, of course, in order to survive\\n\\nand for our brain to function\\n\\nand our bodily organs to function.\\n\\nBut our brain is wired such that it has a threat sensor,\\n\\nwhich is carbon dioxide levels are getting too high.\\n\\nAnd that's what triggers the motor reflex to breathe\\n\\nand in some cases gasp for air,\\n\\ndepending on how starved for air we are.\\n\\nSo if you do cyclic hyperventilation,\\n\\nwhether or not it's Wim Hof method\\n\\nor whether or not it's TUMO method,\\n\\nagain, these things are similar.\\n\\nThey're not exactly the same.\\n\\nThere are other breathing methods\\n\\nthat incorporate cyclic hyperventilation.\\n\\nWhat you're doing is you're getting rid\\n\\nof a lot of carbon dioxide\\n\\nand therefore you're removing the impulse\\n\\nor lowering the impulse to breathe\\n\\nso that when you enter that breath hold phase\\n\\nafter the hyperventilation,\\n\\nit's a much longer period of time\\n\\nbefore you feel the anxiety and the hunger\\n\\nand the impulse to breathe.\\n\\nThat's one of the real benefits of any technique\\n\\nthat incorporates cyclic hyperventilation\\n\\nis that rather than reduce your stress level in real time,\\n\\nit actually does the opposite.\\n\\nIt increases your stress level,\\n\\nincreases your levels of autonomic arousal,\\n\\nbut you're doing it deliberately.\\n\\nAnd then during those breath holds,\\n\\nwhat's happening is you have a lot of adrenaline\\n\\ncirculating in your system\\n\\nbecause of the way that hyperventilation\\n\\ntriggers the release of adrenaline from your adrenal glands.\\n\\nIt also triggers the release of epinephrine,\\n\\nwhich is the same as adrenaline\\n\\nfrom a little brain area called locus coeruleus,\\n\\nwhich makes you feel more alert.\\n\\nAnd then during those breath holds\\n\\nand in the subsequent rounds of cyclic hyperventilation,\\n\\npeople experience what it is\\n\\nto have a lot of adrenaline in their system,\\n\\nbut they are controlling the release of that adrenaline,\\n\\nwhich is far and away different\\n\\nthan when life events are triggering that adrenaline.\\n\\nSo what it really is\\n\\nis a form of self-induced stress inoculation.\\n\\nAnd I do think there are benefits\\n\\nto practicing cyclic hyperventilation\\n\\nbecause it does allow you to learn\\n\\nhow to self-deploy adrenaline and epinephrine\\n\\nfrom locus coeruleus and from the adrenals.\\n\\nRight, got that backwards.\\n\\nAdrenaline from your adrenals\\n\\nand epinephrine from locus coeruleus.\\n\\nAnd it allows you to explore\\n\\nwhat it is to maintain calm state of mind and body\\n\\nwhen you have a lot of adrenaline in your system,\\n\\nwhich certain studies are starting to show\\n\\ncan allow people to be able to lean\\n\\ninto the stressful aspects of life.\\n\\nAnd let's be honest, life is stressful in any event.\\n\\nNow we're all going to experience stress\\n\\nat some point or another.\\n\\nAnd when we do, we want to make sure\\n\\nthat we're not overtaken by the release of adrenaline\\n\\nfrom the adrenals,\\n\\nthat sudden surge of epinephrine from locus coeruleus.\\n\\nSo doing cyclic hyperventilation,\\n\\nmaybe one or two times per week,\\n\\nagain, 25 breaths, active inhale, passive or active exhale.\\n\\nDo expect to feel tingly\\n\\nbecause of that reduction in carbon dioxide\\n\\nfrom exhaling so much.\\n\\nDo expect to feel a little bit agitated.\\n\\nBe very careful doing this\\n\\nif you're somebody who has anxiety attacks\\n\\nor somebody who has panic attacks or disorders of any kind.\\n\\nBut if you don't and you want to explore this,\\n\\nyou'll notice you start to feel really ramped up.\\n\\nAnd then during the breath holds,\\n\\nwhich again can be done by exhaling and stopping\\n\\nfor some period of time, 15, maybe even 60 seconds,\\n\\nis a time in which you can explore\\n\\nhow to remain mentally calm.\\n\\nSome people even choose to do math problems\\n\\nor think of things in a kind of structured way\\n\\nwhile they have a lot of these hormone neurotransmitters\\n\\ncirculating at high levels in their system.\\n\\nIn other words, as a way to learn to manage your mind\\n\\nand body under conditions of stress.\\n\\nNow, if you are somebody\\n\\nwho's using deliberate cold exposure,\\n\\neither cold showers or ice baths or cold immersion,\\n\\nI often get asked how best to breathe\\n\\nduring those different types of activities.\\n\\nReally, there's no best way to breathe.\\n\\nAlthough if you wanted to turn those activities\\n\\ninto their own form of stress inoculation,\\n\\nagain, please don't use cyclic hyperventilation.\\n\\nThat's dangerous.\\n\\nI don't recommend it whatsoever.\\n\\nBut you can try to actively slow your breathing.\\n\\nThat is to make sure\\n\\nthat you're engaging in rhythmic breathing.\\n\\nNow, up until now,\\n\\nI've said that rhythmic breathing is the default.\\n\\nPrebotsinger nucleus controlling rhythmic breathing\\n\\nis the default.\\n\\nAnd that doubling up on inhales and exhales\\n\\nis something that happens\\n\\nwhen you deliberately take over\\n\\nthe action of prebotsinger complex.\\n\\nNow, that's true 99% of the time.\\n\\nHowever, there are certain conditions\\n\\nsuch as conditions of heightened state\\n\\nof emotional arousal, right?\\n\\nIf you think about somebody who's been crying,\\n\\noftentimes they'll do the double inhale exhale\\n\\nthat says, or triple inhales,\\n\\nor if somebody's very, very afraid, it's all inhales, okay?\\n\\nSo it does sometimes happen spontaneously.\\n\\nActually, when we get into very cold water,\\n\\nthere's a very robust decrease\\n\\nin the activation of the prefrontal cortex,\\n\\nwhich is the area of brain real estate\\n\\nright behind the forehead that controls structured thinking,\\n\\nyour ability to reason and make sense of what's going on.\\n\\nIf you get into really cold water,\\n\\nyou should not expect that brain region to work,\\n\\nor at least not work very well at all\\n\\nfor the first 20 or 30 seconds that you're in the cold water.\\n\\nFrom the time you get into cold water,\\n\\nbecause here we're talking about deliberate cold exposure,\\n\\nI encourage you to try and control your breathing\\n\\nand make it rhythmic.\\n\\nThat is inhales, follow exhales, follow inhales,\\n\\nfollow exhales, even if they have to be fast,\\n\\ninhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nBecause the default,\\n\\nwhen we get into a stressful circumstance,\\n\\nemotionally or physically stressful circumstance,\\n\\nis that rhythmic breathing stops\\n\\nand that parafacial nucleus takes over and it's,\\n\\nah, ah, ah, and it's that kind of panicky mode.\\n\\nAnd by simply controlling our breath,\\n\\nagain, even if it's fast,\\n\\nfrom inhale to exhale and making sure\\n\\nthat we're alternating inhales and exhales rhythmically,\\n\\nand what you'll find is that you'll be able to navigate\\n\\nthat what would otherwise be a very stressful circumstance\\n\\nand make it less stressful or maybe even pleasant.\\n\\nAnd that skill definitely translates\\n\\nto other aspects of life in which,\\n\\nyou know, you're hit square in the face\\n\\nwith something stressful.\\n\\nYou'll notice your breathing and your pattern of breathing\\n\\nswitching to multiple inhales or, you know, a breath holding,\\n\\nessentially departing from rhythmic breathing\\n\\nand by quickly returning to rhythmic breathing\\n\\nand maybe even trying to slow the breathing\\n\\nand extend those exhales,\\n\\nyou'll find that you can very quickly calm down.\\n\\nNext, I'd like to discuss what I find\\n\\nto be an absolutely fascinating topic.\\n\\nIt's also one that's highly useful in the world,\\n\\nwhich is how your specific patterns of breathing\\n\\nrelate to your ability to learn and to remember information,\\n\\nhow it can modulate fear,\\n\\nand a number of other aspects of how your brain functions.\\n\\nThis is a literature that's been reviewed recently\\n\\nin a lot of exquisite detail in a beautiful review\\n\\nby Jack Feldman, who I mentioned earlier,\\n\\none of the pioneers of the neuroscience of breathing.\\n\\nThe title of the review is Breathing Rhythm and Pattern\\n\\nand Their Influence on Emotion.\\n\\nAgain, we'll provide a link to this review\\n\\nin the show note captions.\\n\\nThis review includes discussion of several studies,\\n\\none in particular that I'll get into in a bit of detail\\n\\nthat describes the following.\\n\\nRight now, I just want you to breathe regularly,\\n\\nmeaning rhythmically.\\n\\nYou can inhale and exhale through your mouth\\n\\nor through your nose.\\n\\nI'd prefer that you do it through your nose\\n\\nbecause nasal breathing,\\n\\nunless you need to breathe through your mouth\\n\\nbecause of hard exercise or eating or talking,\\n\\nis always going to be the better way to go.\\n\\nNasal breathing improves the aesthetic of your face.\\n\\nThat's been shown.\\n\\nWe'll talk about that just briefly in a few minutes.\\n\\nNasal breathing improves the amount of oxygen\\n\\nyou can bring into your system, et cetera, et cetera.\\n\\nSo just breathe, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,\\n\\nand know that during your exhales,\\n\\nyour pupil, that is the pupil of your eye,\\n\\nis getting bigger.\\n\\nAnd as you exhale, it's getting smaller.\\n\\nIn addition, when you inhale,\\n\\nyour reaction time to anything that happens around you,\\n\\na car swerving in front of you,\\n\\nsomething that you might detect in the periphery\\n\\nof your vision or hear off in the distance,\\n\\nincreases significantly compared to when you're exhaling.\\n\\nIn addition, when you are inhaling,\\n\\nyour ability to remember things,\\n\\nespecially things that take a bit of effort to remember,\\n\\nand your ability to learn new information\\n\\nis significantly greater than it is when you're exhaling.\\n\\nNow, as you hear all that,\\n\\nyou're probably thinking, okay, how do I just inhale?\\n\\nWell, of course, that's not going to be the best approach.\\n\\nYou need to exhale as well\\n\\nfor all the reasons you now are well aware of.\\n\\nBut what these findings really illustrate,\\n\\nand I should mention these findings\\n\\nare all carried out in humans, all right?\\n\\nSo these relate to some stuff in animal studies,\\n\\nbut what I just described has been shown\\n\\nin human studies consistently.\\n\\nWhen we inhale, and in particular,\\n\\nwhen we inhale through our nose,\\n\\nour brain is not functioning in the same way\\n\\nas when we exhale.\\n\\nNow, that doesn't mean that our brain is functioning\\n\\nin a deficient way when we exhale.\\n\\nIt just doesn't function as well\\n\\nas it relates to memory retrieval, memory formation,\\n\\nand some other aspects of cognition.\\n\\nNow, you might be asking, why in the world would this be?\\n\\nWell, I wasn't consulted at the design phase,\\n\\nand anyone that tells you that they were,\\n\\nyou should back away from quickly.\\n\\nBut one reasonable explanation\\n\\nfor why our brain functions better,\\n\\nat least in the context of what I just talked about,\\n\\nwhen we inhale, is because the olfactory system\\n\\nis actually the most ancient sensory system\\n\\nof all the sensory systems we have.\\n\\nSo before vision, before audition, before touch,\\n\\nbefore all of that,\\n\\nthe olfactory system is the most ancient system.\\n\\nAnd the olfactory system, of course,\\n\\nis designed to detect chemicals in the environment.\\n\\nAnd so if you imagine an early organism\\n\\nthat perhaps we evolved from, or perhaps we didn't,\\n\\nbut nonetheless that we share some features of,\\n\\nat least in terms of olfactory function,\\n\\nin order to get that chemical information into the brain,\\n\\nwe need to inhale.\\n\\nWe need to bring that information in.\\n\\nNow for aquatic animals, they could take it in through water,\\n\\nbut for animals that are terrestrial, that live on land,\\n\\nthey would have to get it through the air.\\n\\nSo inhalation, we know, activates certain regions\\n\\nof the so-called piriform cortex,\\n\\nthese are areas of the neocortex that are more ancient,\\n\\nas well as increasing the activity of brain areas\\n\\nsuch as the hippocampus,\\n\\nwhich is a brain area involved in learning and memory.\\n\\nIn fact, one of the studies\\n\\nthat illustrates this most beautifully\\n\\nis a study that was published\\n\\nin the Journal of Neuroscience in 2016.\\n\\nBy the way, Journal of Neuroscience is a very fine journal.\\n\\nAnd the title of this paper is\\n\\nNasal Respiration Entrains Human Limbic Oscillations\\n\\nand Modulates Cognitive Function.\\n\\nThis is a paper that followed up on an earlier paper\\n\\nthat showed that when people breathe in through their nose,\\n\\ntheir recognition and their discrimination\\n\\nof different odors was far greater\\n\\nthan when they breathed in through their mouth.\\n\\nNow that result was interesting,\\n\\nbut it was also sort of a duh,\\n\\nbecause you smell things with your nose, not your mouth.\\n\\nYou taste things with your mouth\\n\\nand you speak with your mouth\\n\\nand there are a bunch of other things\\n\\nyou can do with your mouth.\\n\\nBut nonetheless, that study pointed to the idea\\n\\nthat the brain is different during nasal inhalations\\n\\nversus nasal exhalations\\n\\nversus mouth inhalations versus exhalations.\\n\\nWhat it basically showed is\\n\\nthat the brain ramps up its levels of activity\\n\\nand that signal to noise that we talked about earlier,\\n\\nif you recall, that ability for the brain\\n\\nto detect things in the environment\\n\\nis increased during inhalations.\\n\\nBut because that earlier study focused on smell,\\n\\non olfaction, there was a bit of a confound there.\\n\\nIt was hard to separate out the variables.\\n\\nSo this paper, the one I just mentioned,\\n\\nNasal Respiration and Transhuman Limbic Oscillations\\n\\nand Modulates Cognitive Function,\\n\\ndid not look at detection of odors,\\n\\nrather it looked at things like reaction time or fear.\\n\\nAnd basically what it found is\\n\\nthat reaction time is greatly reduced\\n\\nwhen people are inhaling.\\n\\nSo they had people look at fearful stimuli.\\n\\nThey looked at their reaction time to fearful stimuli.\\n\\nIn other words, their ability\\n\\nto detect certain kinds of stimuli.\\n\\nAnd they were given a lot of different kinds of stimuli.\\n\\nSo they had to be able to discriminate\\n\\nbetween one sort of it, oops, excuse me, one.\\n\\nBy the way, folks, for those listening,\\n\\nI just bumped the microphone, getting rather animated here.\\n\\nWhat these subjects had to do was detect\\n\\none type of stimulus versus another stimulus\\n\\nthat they were being exposed to.\\n\\nAnd what they found is if people were inhaling\\n\\nas that fear-inducing stimulus was presented,\\n\\ntheir reaction time to nose, it was much, much faster.\\n\\nAnd they related that to patterns of brain activity.\\n\\nAnd they were able to do that\\n\\nbecause they were actually recording\\n\\nfrom the brain directly from beneath the skull.\\n\\nAnd they were able to do that\\n\\nbecause they had some patients\\n\\nthat had intracranial electrodes embedded in their brain\\n\\nfor sake of trying to detect epileptic seizures.\\n\\nSo there's a lot to this study\\n\\nand a lot that we could discuss,\\n\\nbut the basic takeaway is that when people are inhaling,\\n\\nthat is when they're drawing air in\\n\\nthrough their nose in particular,\\n\\ntheir ability to detect what's going on\\n\\nin the world around them is greatly enhanced.\\n\\nAnd not just for fear, but also for surprise of all sorts.\\n\\nSo when people are inhaling,\\n\\ntheir ability to detect novel stimuli,\\n\\nthings that are unexpected\\n\\nor that are unusual in their environment\\n\\nis significantly increased.\\n\\nAgain, we'll put a link to this study as well.\\n\\nI find it to be one of the more interesting studies\\n\\nin this realm, although there are now\\n\\nmany additional studies that support this statement\\n\\nthat I made earlier, which is that during inhalation,\\n\\nalso called inspiration,\\n\\nthere are a number of very fast physiological changes,\\n\\nsuch as changes in pupil diameter,\\n\\nchanges in the activity of the hippocampus,\\n\\nthis memory encoding and retrieval area of the brain,\\n\\nand other areas of the brain.\\n\\nSo what's the tool takeaway from this?\\n\\nIf you are sitting down to read or research\\n\\nor study or you really want to learn some information,\\n\\nmaybe you're listening to a podcast\\n\\nor some other sorts of information that you want to retain,\\n\\nit actually makes sense to increase the duration\\n\\nor the intensity of your inhales as you do that.\\n\\nThe more that you're inhaling relative to exhaling\\n\\nin terms of duration,\\n\\nthe more that your brain is in this focused mode\\n\\nand this mode of being able to access\\n\\nand retrieve information better.\\n\\nNow, there's one caveat to this that I think is important\\n\\nbecause I know a number of people listen to this podcast\\n\\nfor sake of gleaning tools,\\n\\nnot just for cognitive enhancement,\\n\\nbut for physical enhancement.\\n\\nIt turns out that when you are inhaling air,\\n\\nyou're actually less able,\\n\\nor I should say less efficient,\\n\\nat generating voluntary movements.\\n\\nNow, that might come as a surprise.\\n\\nYou know, up until now,\\n\\nwe've basically been talking about inhalation is great,\\n\\nalmost to the point where you wonder,\\n\\nlike, is exhalation good for anything, right?\\n\\nYou don't want to over-breathe\\n\\nand kick out too much carbon dioxide.\\n\\nWell, of course, exhalation is great for things.\\n\\nIn fact, if you're somebody that's played baseball\\n\\nor softball, well, what are you told?\\n\\nThat you should exhale on the swing\\n\\nto generate the maximum amount of power.\\n\\nIf you're somebody who has done martial arts of any kind,\\n\\nit was traditional Western boxing, as you strike,\\n\\nthat's where people typically do the hi-yah,\\n\\nlaying the sort of classic karate type thing.\\n\\nThat's more of a movie thing.\\n\\nI don't know whether or not people actually use the hi-yah,\\n\\nbut in boxing, oftentimes people will do the shh.\\n\\nYou know, they'll do a rapid exhalation,\\n\\na forceful exhalation.\\n\\nKeeping in mind, again, that inhales typically are active.\\n\\nThey engage the diaphragmatic muscle.\\n\\nThey engage those intercostal muscles,\\n\\nwhereas exhales tend to be passive\\n\\nunless we take active control of the exhale.\\n\\nAnd indeed, our ability to generate fast,\\n\\ndirected, so-called volitional voluntary movements\\n\\nis greatly enhanced if we do them\\n\\nduring the exhale, not the inhale.\\n\\nNow, with all of that said,\\n\\nI haven't yet really talked about mouth\\n\\nversus nasal breathing.\\n\\nAnd it really can be a fairly short discussion\\n\\nbecause what abundant data now show\\n\\nand has been beautifully described in the book\\n\\ncalled Jaws, A Hidden Epidemic.\\n\\nThis is a book that was written\\n\\nby Paul Ehrlich and Sandra Kahn,\\n\\nmy colleagues at Stanford School of Medicine.\\n\\nIt has an introduction and a foreword from Jared Diamond\\n\\nand from the great Robert Sapolsky,\\n\\nso some real heavy hitters on this book.\\n\\nWhat that book really describes is that whenever possible,\\n\\nmeaning unless you're speaking or eating\\n\\nor you're exercising or other activities require\\n\\nsome change in your pattern of breathing,\\n\\nwe should really all be striving to breathe\\n\\nthrough our nose, not through our mouth.\\n\\nAnd that relates to the increased resistance\\n\\nto breathing through the nose we talked about earlier.\\n\\nAgain, I'll say it a third time,\\n\\nthat increased resistance through the nose\\n\\nallows you to inflate your lungs more, not less.\\n\\nThe other thing that breathing through your nose\\n\\nallows you to do is it both warms and moisturizes\\n\\nthe air that you bring into your lungs,\\n\\nwhich is more favorable for lung health\\n\\nthan breathing through the mouth.\\n\\nHard breathing through the mouth\\n\\nor simply mouth breathing at all\\n\\nis actually quite damaging or can be,\\n\\nI should say quite damaging\\n\\nto some of the respiratory functions of your lungs.\\n\\nThat of course does not mean\\n\\nthat you shouldn't breathe hard through your mouth\\n\\nwhen you're running or sprinting or exercising hard,\\n\\nbut you don't want mouth breathing\\n\\nto be the chronic default pattern that you follow.\\n\\nNasal breathing is the best pattern\\n\\nof breathing to follow as a default state.\\n\\nAnother aspect of nasal breathing\\n\\nthat's really beneficial is that the gas,\\n\\nnitric oxide is actually created in the nasal passages.\\n\\nIt's a gas that can cause relaxation\\n\\nof the smooth muscles that relate to the vasculature,\\n\\nnot just of your nose, but of your brain\\n\\nand for all the tissues of your body.\\n\\nThis is why nasal breathing and not mouth breathing\\n\\nis great for when you want to relieve congestion.\\n\\nSo a lot of these things seem counterintuitive, right?\\n\\nYour nose is stuff,\\n\\nso that mainly makes people breathe through their mouth,\\n\\nbut it turns out that breathing through your nose\\n\\nwill allow some dilation of the vasculature,\\n\\nmore blood flow, dilation of the nasal passages,\\n\\nand delivery of nitric oxide\\n\\nto all the tissues of your body.\\n\\nAnd that dilation of the small capillaries\\n\\nthat innervate essentially every organ of your body\\n\\nallow the delivery of more nutrients\\n\\nand the removal of carbon dioxide\\n\\nand other waste products from those tissues more readily\\n\\nthan if you're not getting enough,\\n\\nexcuse me, nitric oxide into your system.\\n\\nSo a lot of reasons to be a nasal breather.\\n\\nIf you want to check out that book,\\n\\nJaws, Hidden Epidemics, it's a terrific read,\\n\\nand it also shows some absolutely striking pictures,\\n\\ntwin studies and so forth,\\n\\nand some before and afters of people\\n\\nand the aesthetic changes that they experience\\n\\nwhen they shifted from being a mouth breather\\n\\nto a nose breather.\\n\\nThese are striking examples\\n\\nthat have been observed over and over again.\\n\\nWhen people mouth breathe,\\n\\nthere's an elongation of the jaw,\\n\\ndroopiness of the eyelids,\\n\\nand the entire jaw structure really changes\\n\\nin ways that are not aesthetically favorable.\\n\\nFortunately, when people switch to becoming nasal breathers,\\n\\nand of course that takes some encouragement\\n\\neither by mouth taping\\n\\nor doing their cardiovascular exercise with mouth closed\\n\\nor by doing the sorts of exercises\\n\\nthat we talked about earlier,\\n\\nwhen they switch to becoming nasal breathers by default,\\n\\nthe aesthetic changes that occur\\n\\nare very dramatic and very favorable,\\n\\nincluding sort of elevation of the eyebrows,\\n\\nnot in an artificial sense or in a kind of outrageous way,\\n\\nbut elevation of the cheekbones, sharpening of the jaw,\\n\\nand most notably improvements of the teeth\\n\\nand the entire jaw structure.\\n\\nIn fact, one simple test\\n\\nof whether or not you can be an efficient nasal breather\\n\\nand whether or not you've been nasal breathing efficiently\\n\\nor most of the time in the past\\n\\nor whether or not you've been relying more\\n\\non mouth breathing that was described in the book Jaws\\n\\nis you should be able to close your mouth\\n\\nand breathe only through your nose.\\n\\nAgain, this is at rest, not during exercise necessarily.\\n\\nYou might do it during exercise, but close your mouth,\\n\\nput your tongue on the roof of your mouth\\n\\nand it should fit behind your teeth\\n\\nand you should be able to nose breathe in that position.\\n\\nNow, many people won't be able to do that,\\n\\nbut fortunately, as I mentioned earlier,\\n\\nif you nasal breathe,\\n\\nthat is you deliberately nasal breathe when at rest\\n\\nfor some period of time,\\n\\nyou will experience an increased ability to nasal breathe\\n\\nand you should also experience some addition of space\\n\\nwithin the palate of your mouth to allow your tongue\\n\\nto sit more completely on the roof of your mouth.\\n\\nThis is especially true for children\\n\\nthat perform this technique.\\n\\nAgain, I refer you to the book Jaws, A Hidden Epidemic.\\n\\nIt's an absolutely spectacular book.\\n\\nYou can also just look online\\n\\nbefore and after Jaws, Hidden Epidemic\\n\\nand look at some of the changes in facial structure\\n\\nthat occur when people move from mouth to nasal breathing\\n\\nand it's really quite striking.\\n\\nSo during today's episode, per always,\\n\\nwe covered a lot of information.\\n\\nFirst, we talked about the mechanical aspects of breathing,\\n\\nthe lungs, the diaphragm, the trachea and so forth.\\n\\nWe also talked about the chemical aspects of breathing\\n\\nthat really breathing is a way\\n\\nthat we bring oxygen to ourselves\\n\\nand that we get the correct levels\\n\\nor I should say we maintain the correct levels\\n\\nof carbon dioxide in our system,\\n\\nneither too much nor too little\\n\\nin order to allow oxygen to do its magic\\n\\nand to allow carbon dioxide to do its magic\\n\\nbecause as you learned during today's episode,\\n\\ncarbon dioxide is not just a waste by-product.\\n\\nIt has very critical physiological functions.\\n\\nYou need to have enough of it around\\n\\nand therefore you don't want to over breathe,\\n\\nespecially at rest.\\n\\nWe talked about a tool to measure\\n\\nhow well you manage carbon dioxide,\\n\\nthe so-called carbon dioxide tolerance test\\n\\nand various exercises that you can use\\n\\nsimply by breathing to decrease your stress in real time,\\n\\ndecrease your stress chronically around the clock.\\n\\nObviously, that's a good thing,\\n\\nimprove sleep, improve mood.\\n\\nHow to increase breath hold times\\n\\nand why you might want to do that.\\n\\nAlso how to eliminate hiccups.\\n\\nWe talked about how to breathe\\n\\nin order to eliminate the side stitch or side cramp\\n\\nthat you might experience during exercise\\n\\nand how to breathe in order to improve learning\\n\\nand memory reaction time\\n\\nand various other aspects of cognitive and physical function.\\n\\nI do realize it's a lot of information,\\n\\nbut as always, I try and give you information\\n\\nthat is clear, hopefully interesting as well\\n\\nand actionable toward a number of different end points.\\n\\nSo if you're somebody that's just now starting to think\\n\\nabout the application of breath work,\\n\\nI would encourage you to please yes,\\n\\ndo the carbon dioxide tolerance test\\n\\nthat will give you some window into how well\\n\\nor how poorly you're managing breathing.\\n\\nAnd then here's the great news.\\n\\nThe great news is that breath work,\\n\\nthat is deliberate respiration practices\\n\\nare very effective at creating change very quickly.\\n\\nIn some cases, such as the use of the physiological sigh\\n\\nor cyclic hyperventilation,\\n\\nthose changes can be experienced the first time\\n\\nand every time, because again, these are not hacks.\\n\\nThese are aspects of your breathing apparatus,\\n\\nincluding the mechanical stuff and the neural stuff\\n\\nand the gas exchange stuff, all of which you were born with\\n\\nand that are available to you at any moment.\\n\\nSo all you really have to do is explore them\\n\\nand deploy them as you feel necessary.\\n\\nIf you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast,\\n\\nplease subscribe to our YouTube

this podcast.\\n\\nNot so much on today's episode,\\n\\nbut on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,\\n\\nwe discuss supplements.\\n\\nWhile supplements aren't necessary for everybody,\\n\\nmany people derive tremendous benefit from them\\n\\nfor things like improving sleep, hormone function,\\n\\ncognitive function, and so on.\\n\\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is now partnered\\n\\nwith momentous supplements.\\n\\nWe've done that for several reasons.\\n\\nFirst of all, momentous supplements\\n\\nare of the very highest quality.\\n\\nSecond of all, momentous supplements tend to center\\n\\naround single ingredient formulations.\\n\\nThis is incredibly important\\n\\nbecause if you're going to include supplements\\n\\nin your daily regimen,\\n\\nyou're going to want to use the right supplements\\n\\nand the right dosages,\\n\\nand you want to do that in the most biologically\\n\\nand cost-effective way.\\n\\nAnd single ingredient formulations are the only way\\n\\nthat you can determine what works\\n\\nand what doesn't work for you.\\n\\nAnd it's the only way in which you can adjust the dosage\\n\\nof given supplements or maybe even alternate days\\n\\nthat you take one and not the other\\n\\nin a way that really allows you to home in\\n\\non which supplements are going to be ideal\\n\\nfor your mental health, physical health, and performance.\\n\\nAlso, momentous supplements ship internationally,\\n\\nand that's great because we know a number of you reside\\n\\noutside of the United States.\\n\\nIf you'd like to see the supplements discussed\\n\\non the Huberman Lab podcast,\\n\\nyou can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,\\n\\nso livemomentous.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nIf you're not already following us on social media,\\n\\nwe are Huberman Lab on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook,\\n\\nand LinkedIn.\\n\\nAnd I should mention that on all those platforms,\\n\\nI discuss science and science-related tools,\\n\\nsome of which overlap with the contents\\n\\nof the Huberman Lab podcast,\\n\\nbut much of which is distinct from the content\\n\\nof the Huberman Lab podcast.\\n\\nAgain, it's Huberman Lab on all social

       " Document(page_content=\"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\n\\nwhere we discuss science\\n\\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\\n\\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\\n\\nand I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology\\n\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\n\\nToday, we are talking about goal setting\\n\\nand achieving goals.\\n\\nNow, we've done three full episodes\\n\\nabout this topic previously.\\n\\nI did a solo episode about this topic\\n\\nwhere I described the neuroscience\\n\\nof the circuitry in the brain and body\\n\\nthat underlies goal setting and pursuit.\\n\\nI also hosted two expert guests\\n\\nwho have done extensive research on these topics.\\n\\nThose guests were Dr. Emily Balchettis\\n\\nfrom New York University and Dr. Maya Shankar.\\n\\nSo today's episode is going to focus on the key takeaways\\n\\nfrom those three previous episodes,\\n\\nas well as incorporate new information\\n\\nthat has been published in the scientific literature\\n\\nsince those episodes aired,\\n\\nso that by the end of today's episode,\\n\\nyou will have a potent toolkit\\n\\nfor setting and pursuing goals.\\n\\nWe will talk about how to select\\n\\nwhich goals to pursue and when.\\n\\nWe will talk about how to measure your progress.\\n\\nWe will talk about how to initiate\\n\\nand sustain motivation as you pursue your goals.\\n\\nWe are also going to dispel some prominent myths\\n\\nabout goal setting and pursuit.\\n\\nGiven that this is a toolkit episode,\\n\\nI will talk about some of the underlying\\n\\nbiological mechanisms for the protocols that I described,\\n\\nbut most of what I will cover are the protocols themselves,\\n\\nthe how to identify a goal,\\n\\nselect the best goal for you to pursue,\\n\\nhow to initiate goal pursuit,\\n\\nhow to maintain goal pursuit,\\n\\nhow to evaluate progress,\\n\\nand how to do the post hoc analysis after you achieve a goal,\\n\\nor as the case may be, not achieve a goal.\\n\\nAlthough I am confident that if you implement\\n\\neven a subset of the protocols that we cover today,\\n\\nthat you stand the greatest possible chance\\n\\nof both setting the proper goal and achieving that goal.\\n\\nAnd I can say that both with confidence and humility,\\n\\nbecause the protocols I describe were not created by me.\\n\\nThey are gleaned from the scientific peer reviewed literature\\n\\nand they have been shown to work.\\n\\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast\\n\\nis separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.\\n\\nIt is however, part of my desire and effort\\n\\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\\n\\nabout science and science related tools\\n\\nto the general public.\\n\\nIn keeping with that theme,\\n\\nI'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.\\n\\nOur first sponsor is Eight Sleep.\\n\\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress covers\\n\\nwith cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.\\n\\nSleep is the foundation of mental health,\\n\\nphysical health, and performance.\\n\\nWhen we're sleeping well and enough,\\n\\neverything in life goes much better.\\n\\nAnd when we aren't sleeping well or long enough,\\n\\nthings in life get worse.\\n\\nWe know that from data,\\n\\nwe all know that from our own experience.\\n\\nOne of the essential things to getting a great night's sleep\\n\\nis that the temperature of your sleeping environment\\n\\nneeds to be such that your core body temperature drops\\n\\nby about one to three degrees\\n\\nin order to fall and stay deeply asleep,\\n\\nand then increase by one to three degrees\\n\\nin order to wake up feeling refreshed in the morning.\\n\\nWith Eight Sleep smart mattress covers,\\n\\nyou can program the temperature of your sleeping environment\\n\\nso that it's ideally matched to your temperature needs.\\n\\nI started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover\\n\\na few years ago, and it has completely transformed\\n\\nthe quality of the sleep that I get.\\n\\nSo much so that I actually loathe traveling\\n\\nbecause I don't have my Eight Sleep mattress cover\\n\\nwhen I travel.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try Eight Sleep,\\n\\nyou can go to eightsleep.com slash Huberman,\\n\\nand you'll save up to $150 off their pod three cover.\\n\\nEight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,\\n\\nselect countries in the EU and Australia.\\n\\nAgain, that's eightsleep.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nToday's episode is also brought to us by Maui Nui Venison.\\n\\nMaui Nui Venison is the most nutrient dense\\n\\nand delicious red meat available.\\n\\nI've spoken before on this podcast in solo episodes\\n\\nand with guests about the need to get approximately\\n\\none gram of high quality protein per pound of body weight\\n\\neach day for optimal nutrition.\\n\\nNow there are many different ways that one can do that,\\n\\nbut a key thing is to make sure that you're not doing that\\n\\nby ingesting excessive calories.\\n\\nMaui Nui Venison has the highest density\\n\\nof quality protein per calorie,\\n\\nand it achieves that in delicious things like ground meats,\\n\\nvenison steaks, jerky, and bone broth.\\n\\nI particularly like the ground venison.\\n\\nI make those into venison burgers\\n\\nprobably five times a week or more.\\n\\nI also like the jerky for its convenience,\\n\\nespecially when I'm traveling\\n\\nor I'm especially busy with work\\n\\nand know that I'm getting an extremely nutrient dense\\n\\nhigh quality source of protein.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison,\\n\\nyou

and pursuit.\\n\\nAnd as I mentioned a few minutes ago,\\n\\nthis is a toolkit episode.\\n\\nSo I'm not going to talk too much\\n\\nabout the mechanistic underpinnings\\n\\nof the protocols for goal setting and pursuit.\\n\\nI'm mostly just going to give you those protocols.\\n\\nBut before I do that, I want to take just three minutes,\\n\\nI promise just three minutes or less,\\n\\nand describe the neural circuitry\\n\\ninvolved in goal setting and pursuit.\\n\\nAnd there are two reasons to do that.\\n\\nFirst of all, the biology of goal setting and pursuit\\n\\nis absolutely beautiful.\\n\\nIt's incredible that we and many other animals in fact,\\n\\nhave this neural circuitry\\n\\nand that it works in the way that it does.\\n\\nBut equally important is that when we have\\n\\na mechanistic understanding or framework\\n\\nfor how a protocol or set of protocols work,\\n\\nit makes it much easier to tweak those protocols\\n\\nand customize them to our unique needs.\\n\\nOkay, so with that said,\\n\\nthe goal setting and pursuit circuitry\\n\\nessentially consists of four major stations in the brain.\\n\\nAlthough it's important to point out\\n\\nthat each of those stations has a number of other connections\\n\\nthat are important for the whole goal setting\\n\\nand pursuit process.\\n\\nBut we can distill things down to four major hubs\\n\\nor stations within the brain.\\n\\nAnd those are the basal ganglia,\\n\\nthe lateral prefrontal cortex\\n\\nand the orbital frontal cortex.\\n\\nSo going through those one by one,\\n\\nthe amygdala is a structure within the brain.\\n\\nYou actually have two of them,\\n\\none on each side of the brain\\n\\nthat is involved in circuits associated with arousal\\n\\nin driving levels of alertness.\\n\\nIt's also involved in fear.\\n\\nYou've probably heard that many times before,\\n\\nbut also things like anxiety.\\n\\nAnd actually the amygdala can be involved\\n\\nin what we call positive valence experiences,\\n\\nnot just the bad stuff like fear and anxiety,\\n\\nbut also positive forms of arousal and even learning.\\n\\nThe basal ganglia include a lot\\n\\nof different brain structures.\\n\\nBut for sake of today's discussion,\\n\\nwhat you need to know is that the basal ganglia\\n\\nincludes two major pathways.\\n\\nOne is the so-called go pathway,\\n\\nwhich is the pathway involved in generating actions.\\n\\nAnd the other is the so-called no-go pathway\\n\\nor the pathway involved in withholding or ceasing action.\\n\\nAnd this is really important to understand\\n\\nbecause with all goals, we have to ask ourselves,\\n\\nare we trying to learn how to do something new\\n\\nor are we trying to withhold a certain set of actions?\\n\\nAnd of course, anytime we learn anything,\\n\\nit's a process of both generating\\n\\nand withholding certain actions.\\n\\nSo we've got the amygdala and we have the basal ganglia,\\n\\nwhich has this go action initiating\\n\\nand no-go action withholding circuitry within it.\\n\\nAnd then there's the lateral prefrontal cortex,\\n\\nwhich is involved in immediate and long-term planning.\\n\\nAnd this is going to be a key component\\n\\nof today's discussion\\n\\nbecause we aren't going to be talking\\n\\nabout lateral prefrontal cortex per se,\\n\\nbut we are going to be talking about time perception\\n\\nin the context of setting and achieving our goals\\n\\nbecause setting and achieving our goals\\n\\nis all about being able to orient both in space,\\n\\nknowing where we are and what we're doing,\\n\\nbut also in time,\\n\\nknow where we are in that road of progress\\n\\ntoward achieving our goal or crossing that finish line\\n\\nand repeatedly updating those finish lines in many cases.\\n\\nAnd the fourth structure is the orbital frontal cortex,\\n\\nwhich like all brain areas tends to be a multitasker,\\n\\ndoes a bunch of different things.\\n\\nBut for sake of today's discussion,\\n\\nit's important to understand\\n\\nthat the orbital frontal cortex is involved in evaluation\\n\\nof our current emotional state and arousal state\\n\\nas it relates to our goal pursuit.\\n\\nFor instance, are we happy because we are sensing progress\\n\\nor are we unhappy and feeling frustrated or sad or angry\\n\\nbecause we are feeling that we are not achieving progress\\n\\nor that somehow we can't get into the sorts of actions\\n\\nthat are going to allow us to eventually reach our goals.\\n\\nOkay, so I described four major structures,\\n\\nall of which communicate with each other\\n\\nand of course a lot of other brain areas.\\n\\nAnd those four structures were the amygdala,\\n\\nthe basal ganglia, the go and no-go circuitry,\\n\\nthe lateral prefrontal cortex\\n\\nand the orbital frontal cortex.\\n\\nAnd those represent the core components\\n\\nof the neural circuitry involved\\n\\nin goal setting and pursuit.\\n\\nNow I realize I didn't time that section,\\n\\nso I don't know whether or not it was three minutes or less,\\n\\nbut if it was shorter than three minutes, great.\\n\\nAnd if it was longer than three minutes,\\n\\nwell, I promise to shave a couple of minutes\\n\\noff the end of this episode.\\n\\nOkay, so now you have the understanding\\n\\nthat we all have the same neural circuitry\\n\\nfor goal setting and pursuit.\\n\\nI find that amazing,\\n\\nregardless of whether or not you want to achieve\\n\\na fitness goal or an academic goal or a work goal,\\n\\nmonetary goal, relationship goal.\\n\\nMaybe you want to just get better at relaxing.\\n\\nI've been told I should perhaps pursue that goal.\\n\\nWell, you're going to use the same neural circuits\\n\\nfor each and any of those.\\n\\nI find that incredible.\\n\\nI also find that very reassuring,\\n\\nbecause what it means is that if we can focus\\n\\non the tools and protocols that are anchored\\n\\nin the biology of goal setting and pursuit\\n\\nas we understand them to exist in all humans\\n\\nand indeed in other animals as well,\\n\\nwell, then we should have the greatest possible confidence\\n\\nthat we will in fact achieve our goals.\\n\\nSo how do we go about doing that?\\n\\nWell, the first question you need to ask yourself\\n\\nis what goal do I want to pursue?\\n\\nAnd the first protocol for deciding\\n\\nwhat goal you want to pursue is actually a quite simple one\\n\\nin terms of how it's stated,\\n\\nbut it's fairly complex for a lot of people to answer.\\n\\nAnd that is which specific goal\\n\\nare you going to try and pursue?\\n\\nBecause guess what, folks?\\n\\nMost people who try to achieve many goals simultaneously\\n\\nfail at all of them.\\n\\nThis is what I call the overhaul approach\\n\\nwhen people think, okay, you know,\\n\\non January 1 or next month or next week,\\n\\nor perhaps even today, I'm going to start exercising.\\n\\nI'm going to start meditating.\\n\\nI'm going to learn a language.\\n\\nI'm going to learn to dance.\\n\\nI'm going to do all these different things.\\n\\nAnd that's just too many goals.\\n\\nI think here is an appropriate place\\n\\nto highlight the word priority.\\n\\nA priority literally means one thing\\n\\nthat you place ahead of all others.\\n\\nThese days we hear a lot about priorities, plural,\\n\\nbut we really should be thinking about priority\\n\\nand defining our priority for learning in a given phase.\\n\\nSo if you are somebody who wants to get more physically fit\\n\\nor you want to learn something cognitively, that's terrific.\\n\\nYou are allowed to have multiple goals,\\n\\nbut I highly recommend that you first select just one goal.\\n\\nOf course, you don't let go of other aspects\\n\\nof your mental health and physical health\\n\\nthat you don't throw your life away\\n\\nin service to this one goal.\\n\\nWe've all seen how that goes,\\n\\nand it's not a pretty picture,\\n\\nbut rather that you continue to engage in healthy ways\\n\\nwith the other aspects of your life\\n\\nthat you're proficient at or mostly proficient at,\\n\\nbut that you select one goal\\n\\nthat you're going to try and attain.\\n\\nHow you select that one goal,\\n\\nof course, is going to reflect your values,\\n\\nyour motivation, your resources,\\n\\nbut it's very important that you spend some serious time\\n\\ndefining that one priority, that one goal\\n\\nfor this initial goal setting and pursuit period.\\n\\nAnd in a moment, I'll tell you how long\\n\\nthat goal pursuit period ought to be.\\n\\nBut for some people, the best way to define\\n\\nwhich goal they're going to pursue\\n\\nis to write out the different things that they want,\\n\\nand then essentially cross off the various things\\n\\nthat they're willing to put on hold for the time being\\n\\nand circle the thing that they're really going to focus on\\n\\nand only that thing.\\n\\nAnd again, this is highly individual.\\n\\nIt's going to depend on you, your past, your present,\\n\\nyour future, your resources, all of that.\\n\\nBut having that one priority\\n\\nis going to really increase the probability\\n\\nthat you're going to achieve your goal.\\n\\nNow, we also know from the scientific literature\\n\\nthat how lofty that goal is will impact\\n\\nwhether or not you're able to achieve it.\\n\\nAnd I think most people mistakenly believe\\n\\nthat if a goal is easy to achieve,\\n\\nit's more likely that they will achieve that goal,\\n\\nsort of a duh.\\n\\nBut in fact, the opposite has been shown to be true.\\n\\nIf a goal is too easy to achieve,\\n\\nit seems that it doesn't recruit sufficient amounts\\n\\nof the arousal network that involves the amygdala\\n\\nbut a bunch of other brain structures as well\\n\\nthat get people into the necessary actions\\n\\nto continually pursue that goal.\\n\\nThis perhaps should not be surprising.\\n\\nIn order to learn something,\\n\\nwe have to shift our nervous system into states\\n\\nthat are somewhat uncomfortable.\\n\\nThey should be safely uncomfortable states,\\n\\nbut they should be uncomfortable states.\\n\\nAnd we're going to talk more about this\\n\\nas the episode continues,\\n\\nbut any kind of successful learning or goal pursuit\\n\\nis going to involve errors.\\n\\nIt's going to involve failures.\\n\\nIt's going to involve frustration.\\n\\nIt's going to involve anxiety.\\n\\nAll of those states of mind and body, in fact,\\n\\nshift the brain into modes of so-called neuroplasticity.\\n\\nThey give it the ability to change.\\n\\nAnd that should make perfect sense\\n\\nbecause if you can complete what you need to do easily,\\n\\nthere's absolutely no reason for the neural circuitry\\n\\nin your brain or body to shift in any way.\\n\\nWhy would it?\\n\\nRather, those states of discomfort,\\n\\nfrustration, anxiety, et cetera,\\n\\nrepresent shifts in neurochemical states\\n\\nthat literally open the opportunity\\n\\nfor neuroplasticity to occur,\\n\\nthe changes between neurons that allow those neurons\\n\\nand their associated neural circuits\\n\\nto perform differently in the future\\n\\nwhen we learn something.\\n\\nSo the key here is twofold.\\n\\nFirst, define the specific priority goal\\n\\nthat you're going to pursue\\n\\nand set aside all other goal pursuits.\\n\\nAnd in doing that, it makes sense\\n\\nto pursue a somewhat loftier goal\\n\\nthan perhaps a more mundane goal.\\n\\nOr if you know exactly what goal you're going to prioritize\\n\\nthat you try and achieve perhaps more\\n\\nthan you think you ought to be able to achieve\\n\\nwithin that given goal.\\n\\nAnd within the goal that you decide to prioritize,\\n\\nyou want to set a level of progress,\\n\\na level of performance that you're striving to attain\\n\\nthat's a bit above what you actually believe\\n\\nat this time you can accomplish.\\n\\nNow in doing so, you are inevitably going to encounter\\n\\nsome frustration and anxiety,\\n\\nbut remember the component of the neural circuitry\\n\\nthat we talked about at the beginning of the episode,\\n\\nthe orbital frontal cortex.\\n\\nThat orbital frontal cortex\\n\\nis not just part of a neural circuitry\\n\\nthat assesses how we feel in a given moment\\n\\nas we are trying to pursue a goal,\\n\\nbut it also understands context.\\n\\nIt has the capacity to, for instance,\\n\\nsee that you are experiencing anxiety,\\n\\nknow that you are frustrated,\\n\\nbut now that you understand that anxiety and frustration\\n\\nthat comes with making errors is actually the gateway.\\n\\nIt's a necessary gateway to achieving neural circuit changes,\\n\\nso-called neuroplasticity.\\n\\nWell, the orbital frontal cortex understands that context.\\n\\nIt literally can take information about neuroplasticity.\\n\\nIt can take information about frustration,\\n\\nwhich you now have, and it can combine those\\n\\nsuch that when you experience that frustration,\\n\\nyou experience those errors,\\n\\nand you previously would have wanted to quit,\\n\\nnow you know that you are literally making progress.\\n\\nYou're literally shifting those neural circuits\\n\\nin the direction of improved learning.\\n\\nNow it's also important to remind that neuroplasticity,\\n\\nthe changes in neural circuits\\n\\nthat allow for improved performance in the future\\n\\ndoes not occur instantaneously.\\n\\nThat frustration that occurs during our attempts to learn\\n\\nor to pursue a goal is the trigger for neuroplasticity.\\n\\nThe actual rewiring of neural circuits\\n\\nthat are allows for proficient correct performance\\n\\noccurs during deep sleep and other forms of deep rest.\\n\\nThis is something I've covered extensively\\n\\nin episodes on neuroplasticity and learning.\\n\\nAnd if you'd like to learn more about neuroplasticity,\\n\\nin fact, if you'd like a zero cost toolkit\\n\\nthat defines the so-called super protocol\\n\\nfor neuroplasticity and learning\\n\\nthat is not just nested within the context\\n\\nof goal pursuit and learning, we have that.\\n\\nYou can go to hubermanlab.com.\\n\\nYou go to the menu, go scroll down to newsletter,\\n\\nand you can sign up.\\n\\nIt's completely zero cost.\\n\\nAnd you'll get that as a brief.\\n\\nI believe it's a two or maybe three page PDF.\\n\\nOkay, so returning to goal setting and pursuit.\\n\\nFirst, you need to set your goal.\\n\\nYou really should take the time required\\n\\nto define your priority.\\n\\nWhat are you going to try and learn?\\n\\nAnd then you're going to pick a goal\\n\\nthat really feels challenging,\\n\\nthat feels like it might even be out of reach\\n\\nbecause that will recruit the neural circuits\\n\\nassociated with arousal.\\n\\nThey're motivating enough to get you into action.\\n\\nNow, I want to be very clear.\\n\\nI'm not suggesting that you pick a goal\\n\\nthat's impossible to achieve\\n\\nor that you believe is impossible to achieve.\\n\\nThat's not going to serve you well.\\n\\nRather, I'm saying pick a goal\\n\\nthat feels just a bit out of reach.\\n\\nAnd don't obsess too much about whether or not\\n\\nit's a lot out of reach or a little bit out of reach.\\n\\nPick something you're excited to pursue\\n\\nthat you would really like to accomplish,\\n\\nset that goal, and then just set aside all other goals.\\n\\nStill, of course, maintain or improve other aspects\\n\\nof your life that are necessary for daily living,\\n\\nfor mental health, physical health, et cetera,\\n\\nbut really just focus on one goal.\\n\\nI promise that you will be far more satisfied\\n\\nwith the results if you can truly set a priority.\\n\\nSo once you've defined the specific goal\\n\\nthat you are going to prioritize,\\n\\nthere are two more things that you need to do\\n\\nbefore you start to pursue that goal.\\n\\nThe first one is that you need to define\\n\\nthe specific verbs, the actions that are involved\\n\\nin pursuing that goal.\\n\\nThis is absolutely critical.\\n\\nA lot of people will set a sort of title goal\\n\\nor a goal state.\\n\\nThey'll say, oh, you know, I want to be rich,\\n\\nor I want to be smart.\\n\\nOr they will say, I want to be fit\\n\\nor proficient in a given language.\\n\\nIt's really important that you put\\n\\nadditional specificity on your goal.\\n\\nIn fact, it's important that you put\\n\\na lot of specificity on your goal\\n\\nand that you focus mainly on verbs\\n\\nwhen defining that specificity.\\n\\nNow, there are a lot of reasons for this\\n\\nthat have to do both with increasing the probability\\n\\nthat you will achieve your goal,\\n\\nas well as maintaining motivation as you pursue that goal.\\n\\nSo for instance, rather than saying you want to be fit\\n\\nor you want to be a better runner or swimmer,\\n\\nyou would want to get very specific about the verb\\n\\nthat you're going to engage in\\n\\nin order to achieve that goal.\\n\\nNow, it's somewhat obvious in the case\\n\\nof running or swimming.\\n\\nI think everyone understands\\n\\nthat if you want to be a better runner,\\n\\nthere is going to be some running involved\\n\\nand if you want to be a better swimmer,\\n\\nthere's going to be some swimming involved, of course,\\n\\nbut presumably there'll be some other behaviors as well.\\n\\nEverything from driving to the pool or lacing up your shoes.\\n\\nI mean, there's an essentially near infinite number\\n\\nof verbs involved in any type of goal pursuit.\\n\\nSo what we are talking about here\\n\\nis really defining the goal on a piece of paper.\\n\\nAnd I do think that's important.\\n\\nYou should write this down.\\n\\nAnd I think the process of selecting your goal,\\n\\nthat priority, as well as defining the specificity\\n\\nof the verb action that you're going to pursue\\n\\nshould be done on paper.\\n\\nYou, of course, are going to think,\\n\\nbut then you should write it out.\\n\\nSeeing things on paper and writing them out by hand\\n\\nwith pen or pencil really has been shown\\n\\nto engage neural circuitry in a way that is different\\n\\nthan typing with your thumbs into your phone,\\n\\nwhich, by the way, is a new feature of human evolution.\\n\\nI do believe this is the first time in human evolution\\n\\nthat we have written with our thumbs.\\n\\nI don't know, I don't have a time machine.\\n\\nI can't go back and check,\\n\\nbut I'm willing to place a bet\\n\\nthat that statement is correct.\\n\\nSo the point is that writing things out\\n\\nis not only important, it's also the most effective way\\n\\nto embed knowledge in our nervous system.\\n\\nAnd so I highly recommend that you write things out\\n\\non a piece of paper in your process of goal setting.\\n\\nSo when we are talking about generating verb specificity\\n\\nabout your goal, it would look like the following.\\n\\nSo let's say I want to, quote unquote, get more fit\\n\\nor learn conversational French,\\n\\nor anything for that matter, gardening.\\n\\nMaybe I want to build a gazebo in the backyard\\n\\nor a deck in the backyard.\\n\\nThe key thing to answer is,\\n\\nwhat is the major block of action\\n\\nthat's going to be involved in pursuing that goal?\\n\\nSo for instance, if you want to get more fit\\n\\nand you're going to do that primarily\\n\\nthrough running and weight training\\n\\nor swimming and weight training,\\n\\nyou would want to get very specific\\n\\nin defining that priority goal\\n\\nas I'm going to run X number of miles per week,\\n\\nor I'm going to go to the gym three times per week\\n\\nto lift weights.\\n\\nAlthough I would recommend getting\\n\\neven more specific than that.\\n\\nI would recommend that you literally write down,\\n\\nI'm going to go to the gym three times per week\\n\\nfor a minimum of 60 minutes,\\n\\nwhere 50 minutes of that are carrying out hard work.\\n\\nOkay, with of course, rest between sets, et cetera.\\n\\nOr I'm going to attend three classes per week,\\n\\nor perhaps even just one class per week\\n\\nof learning conversational French.\\n\\nPlus I'm going to spend two hours per week\\n\\nof practicing say word problems or mathematical problems,\\n\\nwhatever it is, you want to define first the priority,\\n\\nthen you want to define the verb action\\n\\nthat represents the bulk of effort towards that priority.\\n\\nSo running in the case of the person\\n\\nwho wants to get fit by running, weightlifting,\\n\\nin the case of the person\\n\\nthat wants to get fit by weightlifting.\\n\\nThough of course I highly recommend people\\n\\ndo both resistance training and cardiovascular training\\n\\nif indeed they want to be truly fit.\\n\\nOr in the case of language learning\\n\\nor learning how to code or gardening\\n\\nor something of that sort,\\n\\nto really define the verb actions involved\\n\\nand then to place specificity\\n\\nin terms of the amount of time\\n\\nthat one is going to try to achieve each week\\n\\nin pursuit of that specific priority goal.\\n\\nNow I realize that that process itself takes a bit of time,\\n\\nbut when you look back on the 100 year plus\\n\\nscientific literature of what leads to successful\\n\\ngoal setting and pursuit,\\n\\nyou find over and over again\\n\\nthat those two components we've been talking about,\\n\\nspecificity and measurability are paramount.\\n\\nYou just simply cannot discard those from the process\\n\\nif you expect yourself to achieve your goals.\\n\\nSo whether or not it's the ABC method\\n\\nor it's the smart method or the smarter method,\\n\\nagain, all acronyms coined to not by me, but by others\\n\\nprevious to this conversation,\\n\\nyou're going to find elements of specificity\\n\\nand measurability showing up again and again.\\n\\nSo these are key features of any protocol\\n\\nthat you are going to use\\n\\nin order to try and set and achieve your goals.\\n\\nAnd I should mention that setting specific goals\\n\\nand clearly defining the verbs\\n\\nthat you're going to engage in to pursue those goals\\n\\nand defining how long you are going to try and engage\\n\\nin those verbs each week to achieve those goals\\n\\nhas significant impact on the probability of success.\\n\\nWe're not talking about a minor effect.\\n\\nIn fact, in the original episode I did\\n\\nabout goal setting and pursuit,\\n\\nI talked about the so-called recycling study.\\n\\nI'm not going to describe it in a lot of detail right now,\\n\\nbut essentially this study looked at motivating people\\n\\nto recycle more recyclable products in the workplace.\\n\\nAnd what they found was that when people were told\\n\\nwhat the specific goal was and what specific actions\\n\\nthey needed to engage in were,\\n\\nand how much of a given batch of refuse,\\n\\nso say after lunch, there's some boxes,\\n\\nthere's some forks, et cetera, some napkins,\\n\\nhow much of that refuse they were going to try\\n\\nto put into the recycle versus the trash,\\n\\nit led to a greater than doubling\\n\\nof successful achievement of that goal.\\n\\nNow that's a perhaps trivial goal to some of you,\\n\\nalthough let's face it, recycling is important,\\n\\nbut that result has been shown again and again and again\\n\\nfor different domains of goal setting and pursuit.\\n\\nSo this thing of setting specificity,\\n\\nreally spending time with it on paper,\\n\\nsetting specificity of actions or which specific actions\\n\\nand then setting specificity of how long you are going\\n\\nto engage in each of those actions each week,\\n\\ngreatly increases the probability that you will achieve\\n\\nthat what previously seemed to be a all too lofty goal.\\n\\nEarlier, I mentioned that during the course\\n\\nof today's episode, we were going to dispel\\n\\nsome common myths about goal setting and pursuit.\\n\\nSo now I'd like to mention two popular myths\\n\\nabout goal setting and pursuit.\\n\\nThe first one is that if we set a post-it,\\n\\nyou know, a little post-it sticky where you write down\\n\\nwhat you're trying to achieve and you put that\\n\\non the refrigerator or you put that on your mirror,\\n\\nthat it increases the probability that you are going\\n\\nto stick to your goal.\\n\\nTurns out that is not the case.\\n\\nAnd the reason for that is that your visual system adapts\\n\\nto whatever is regular in your environment.\\n\\nDoesn't matter whether or not that environment is sparse,\\n\\nso it only has a few things in it,\\n\\nor whether or not it is dense like a forest.\\n\\nAnything that shows up regularly\\n\\nin our visual environment gets canceled out.\\n\\nThis is actually a basic feature of the way\\n\\nyour visual system is wired.\\n\\nSo for those of you that are taking a sticky note\\n\\nor a magnet or a sign and putting it on your mirror\\n\\nand leaving it there from day to day,\\n\\nmaybe that says, you know, run 60 minutes today\\n\\nor study French 20 minutes or whatever the goal\\n\\nhappens to be.\\n\\nIf you leave it there, day to day to day,\\n\\nit actually diminishes the likelihood of progress.\\n\\nI know that seems kind of hard to believe, but it's true.\\n\\nInstead, a better approach is to continually write\\n\\nthat thing out each day and put up a new sticky,\\n\\nput it in a new place, perhaps on the refrigerator,\\n\\nsometimes in the kitchen, maybe on the windshield\\n\\nof your car, although of course remove that\\n\\nwhile you're driving, et cetera.\\n\\nIf you are going to incorporate visual reminders\\n\\nin your goal setting and goal pursuit process,\\n\\nyou want to change those each and every day.\\n\\nThis is actually something that perhaps app developers\\n\\nwill start to incorporate,\\n\\nbecause I think the notifications that come through\\n\\non various apps designed to remind us to do certain things\\n\\ncan be helpful, but there too, we tend to attenuate to them\\n\\nand we simply either do not notice them\\n\\nor we start to swipe them away over time.\\n\\nSo visual reminders can be very effective\\n\\nif you want to use them, great, you certainly don't have to,\\n\\nbut if you're going to use them,\\n\\nyou want to update them every single day.\\n\\nOtherwise your visual system and certainly the areas\\n\\nof your brain that are associated with assessing novelty\\n\\nand emotionality will simply start to cancel those away.\\n\\nSo the first common myth that we're dispelling\\n\\nis what I call the post-it fallacy.\\n\\nThe idea that if you write something down on a post-it\\n\\nand you post it in an area that you frequent every morning\\n\\nor every day or every night,\\n\\nthat you stand a higher probability of adhering\\n\\nto what is on that post-it, that is simply not true.\\n\\nYou would want to replace it every day\\n\\nand you would also be wise to move that post-it\\n\\nto different locations.\\n\\nThe second myth is that if you want to increase\\n\\nyour motivation toward pursuing a goal\\n\\nand you want to increase the probability\\n\\nthat you will achieve that goal,\\n\\nthat you should engage in so-called accountability,\\n\\nmeaning that you should tell people\\n\\nyou are going to achieve that goal.\\n\\nNow, I realize that there are some prominent examples\\n\\nin pop culture of people posting something on social media\\n\\nand saying, you know, in three years,\\n\\nI'm going to be playing in Wembley Stadium\\n\\nor in two years, watch, I'm going to be at the top level\\n\\nof my game, whatever that game happens to be.\\n\\nSure, there are examples of that.\\n\\nAnd those are beautiful and inspiring examples.\\n\\nHowever, the scientific data tell us\\n\\nthat if we inform people around us,\\n\\nthat for instance, we are going to write a book\\n\\nor that we're going to start a podcast\\n\\nor that we are going to run a marathon\\n\\nor whatever it happens to be,\\n\\nmore often than not, we get feedback\\n\\nthat is generally positive inform.\\n\\nI think that's good and to be expected, frankly,\\n\\na friend tells us, hey, I'm going to write a book\\n\\nor I'm going to pursue a new fitness goal\\n\\nor I'm going to learn a language.\\n\\nWe say, great, go for it.\\n\\nYou can totally do it.\\n\\nYou're very likely to succeed.\\n\\nGo for it.\\n\\nHow do you want me to support you?\\n\\nIs there anything I can do to support you?\\n\\nThose all are, frankly, healthy exchanges.\\n\\nAnd yet the data tell us that the positive feedback\\n\\nthat we get from others,\\n\\nwhen we announce that we're going after a goal,\\n\\nactivate certain reward systems\\n\\nand motivation systems within our brain\\n\\nthat then quickly dissipate\\n\\nand then diminish the probability\\n\\nthat we'll engage in the type of behaviors\\n\\nthat actually lead us to achieve that goal.\\n\\nSo we have the post-it fallacy\\n\\nand we have the myth of accountability fallacy\\n\\nwithin the context of goal pursuit.\\n\\nI, of course, am not saying that accountability is bad.\\n\\nTo the contrary, accountability is a great thing\\n\\nboth to ourselves and to others.\\n\\nIt's something that we should all cultivate throughout life.\\n\\nI'm merely talking about the myth of accountability\\n\\nin the context of goal pursuit.\\n\\nAnd I'm actually being more specific than that.\\n\\nI'm saying, don't tell people\\n\\nthat you're going to go out and achieve something\\n\\nprior to initiating action toward that goal,\\n\\nbecause in fact, the positive feedback that we get\\n\\nwill diminish the probability\\n\\nthat we will continually pursue that goal\\n\\nin a way that allows us to achieve it.\\n\\nSo you could interpret the information I just gave you\\n\\nas meaning that perhaps it's better to tell someone\\n\\nwho doubts us that we are going to achieve a goal.\\n\\nAnd then, of course,\\n\\nthey're not going to give us the positive feedback.\\n\\nWe're not going to get all that reward circuitry activated.\\n\\nRather, we're going to get the friction circuitry activated\\n\\nof us wanting to prove ourselves and overcome the,\\n\\nlet's just say, the lack of faith\\n\\nin our ability to achieve a goal.\\n\\nAnd indeed, that can work.\\n\\nThere is evidence that can work.\\n\\nBut then, of course, you have to find someone\\n\\nwho doesn't believe in you.\\n\\nYou have to get them to tell you they don't believe in you.\\n\\nAnd that could have all sorts\\n\\nof deleterious psychological effects\\n\\nthat might undermine the goal pursuit process\\n\\nand other things as well.\\n\\nSo if you are lucky enough to know somebody who doubts you,\\n\\ngo ahead, tell them that you want to pursue\\n\\nyour specific priority goal.\\n\\nBut more likely than not,\\n\\nthe best thing to do is to simply keep that goal to yourself.\\n\\nYou may need to inform a family member or others\\n\\nof where you will be between the hours of, say,\\n\\n8 a.m. and 9 a.m. if you're going to be exercising\\n\\nor learning language or meditating,\\n\\nwhatever it is during that period of time.\\n\\nBut what I'm referring to here is what I will call\\n\\nthe don't tell the world rule.\\n\\nDon't tell the world that you're going to achieve X, Y,\\n\\nor Z, just simply tell yourself.\\n\\nIn fact, I would suggest that the more time you can spend\\n\\nwith that one or two or three sheets of paper\\n\\nwhere you defined the goal,\\n\\nthe specific actions that you're going to take,\\n\\nhow you're going to measure progress,\\n\\nwhich we'll talk about a bit more later,\\n\\nthe more time that you can spend with that goal\\n\\nin your mind and on that paper,\\n\\nthe higher the probability that you will achieve that goal.\\n\\nThat stands in stark contrast to telling everyone around you\\n\\nthat you're going to achieve a certain goal,\\n\\nthe so-called accountability myth,\\n\\nor the myth of accountability within the context\\n\\nof goal pursuit would be the more specific way\\n\\nto describe that myth.\\n\\nNow, it turns out there is some utility\\n\\nto having one person that is a so-called accountability buddy\\n\\nif that person is really just strictly\\n\\naddressing accountability.\\n\\nThey are reminding you to do what you need to do,\\n\\nor they are asking you,\\n\\ndid you do what you said you were going to do?\\n\\nBut that's a bit more of a tough love accountability model.\\n\\nWhat the don't tell the world rule is really about\\n\\nis not getting the kind of dopamine\\n\\nand other forms of neurochemical reward\\n\\nthat come from just simply saying\\n\\nthat you're going to pursue a goal,\\n\\nbecause as you'll soon learn,\\n\\nthat dopamine and other molecules too, of course,\\n\\nare going to be critically important,\\n\\nnot just for initiating the sorts of actions\\n\\nrequired to achieve your goals,\\n\\nbut for re-engaging and constantly updating your strategy\\n\\nto ensure that you reach your goals.\\n\\nIt's worth mentioning that the friction model\\n\\nof achieving your goals does work.\\n\\nI mean, I, for instance, am somebody that,\\n\\nif I were to say to a family member, a friend,\\n\\nhey, I'm going to achieve a particular goal,\\n\\nand they said, no, there's no way you can do it,\\n\\nthat would recruit a certain set of neural circuits\\n\\nand hormones and neurochemicals in me\\n\\nthat would make me much more likely\\n\\nto lean into the required set of efforts\\n\\nto achieve that goal.\\n\\nBut there's a danger in approaching a given goal that way,\\n\\nespecially if the goal is something\\n\\nthat you already want to pursue,\\n\\nwhich is that then a lot of your effort\\n\\nbecomes framed in the context of making someone else wrong\\n\\nas opposed to achieving the goal.\\n\\nAnd of course, you can do two things in parallel.\\n\\nYou can achieve your goal and prove somebody else wrong.\\n\\nBut as we've talked about in various episodes\\n\\non motivation and pursuit and the dopamine system,\\n\\nand as we'll talk about a bit more in a few minutes,\\n\\nthere's something tremendously powerful\\n\\nabout learning how to derive pleasure\\n\\nfrom the effort process itself.\\n\\nThat is learning to enjoy the process of pursuing a goal\\n\\nfor sake of that goal for yourself\\n\\nrather than trying to pursue a goal\\n\\nsimply to prove somebody else wrong.\\n\\nI'll just tell you right now that intrinsic motivation,\\n\\nmotivation that is directly attached\\n\\nto the thing that you are doing and route to a goal\\n\\nis the most powerful and sustainable source of motivation.\\n\\nAs many of you know,\\n\\nI've been taking AG1 daily since 2012.\\n\\nSo I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.\\n\\nAG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\\n\\nthat's designed to meet\\n\\nall of your foundational nutrition needs.\\n\\nNow, of course, I try to get enough servings\\n\\nof vitamins and minerals through whole food sources\\n\\nthat include vegetables and fruits every day.\\n\\nBut oftentimes I simply can't get enough servings.\\n\\nBut with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals\\n\\nand the probiotics that I need.\\n\\nAnd it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress.\\n\\nSimply put, I always feel better when I take AG1.\\n\\nI have more focus and energy and I sleep better.\\n\\nAnd it also happens to taste great.\\n\\nFor all these reasons, whenever I'm asked,\\n\\nif you could take just one supplement, what would it be?\\n\\nI answer AG1.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try AG1,\\n\\ngo to drinkag1.com slash Huberman to claim a special offer.\\n\\nThey'll give you five free travel packs\\n\\nplus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.\\n\\nAgain, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman.\\n\\nThe final protocol related to goal setting,\\n\\nbecause really up until now,\\n\\nwe've been talking only about goal setting.\\n\\nWe haven't yet talked about goal pursuit,\\n\\nis that you want your goal to be measurable.\\n\\nAnd when we say measurable,\\n\\nyou really have to define two things.\\n\\nFirst of all, you are going to have to define\\n\\nhow long you are going to pursue this goal overall.\\n\\nIn other words, how long you think it will take\\n\\nbefore you achieve your goal.\\n\\nAnd in addition to that, you are going to have to define\\n\\nhow much time you are going to spend\\n\\npursuing that goal each week or each day.\\n\\nNow, there are an infinite number of time blocks\\n\\nthat one could use to answer these questions.\\n\\nSo for instance, you could set an overall yearly goal\\n\\nand you could break it down into monthly goals\\n\\nwhere you spend X amount of time on that goal each week\\n\\nand X amount of time on that goal each day\\n\\nand essentially ladder up from the shortest timeframe\\n\\nto the longest timeframe required to achieve that goal.\\n\\nAnd certainly all of that is doable,\\n\\nbut that I believe is going to be\\n\\nan overwhelming amount of work\\n\\nand indeed is going to be counterproductive\\n\\ntoward achieving your goal.\\n\\nWhat I recommend, which of course is gleaned\\n\\nfrom the scientific literature,\\n\\nat least the consistencies or the center of mass,\\n\\nthat is the major findings that show up again and again\\n\\nin the scientific literature on goal setting and pursuit\\n\\nis that you establish a roughly 12 week period of time\\n\\nto focus on your specific goal.\\n\\nNow, of course, achieving the entire goal\\n\\nmight take longer than 12 weeks,\\n\\nbut chances are it's not going to take shorter\\n\\nthan 12 weeks, although if it does,\\n\\nyou could simply close out that goal pursuit\\n\\nand then pursue another goal.\\n\\nThere's no reason you couldn't do that,\\n\\nbut there's nothing magical about this 12 week period,\\n\\nbut it seems to adhere to a number of things in society\\n\\nand culture and work schedules in seasonality,\\n\\nmeaning the holidays and the shifts in the overall seasons\\n\\nthat works for most goals and most people.\\n\\nSo a 12 week cycle or roughly a three month cycle,\\n\\nsometimes called the quarterly cycle of goal pursuit\\n\\ntoward your particular goal,\\n\\nI think is a good macro time to focus on.\\n\\nAnd then within that 12 week cycle to define very clearly\\n\\nhow many hours each week and each day\\n\\nand on which days you will pursue that goal.\\n\\nOkay, so it's 12 week cycle to pursue your goal.\\n\\nThat goal might be achieved by the end of that 12 weeks\\n\\nor even prior, it might not be,\\n\\nbut you said a 12 week cycle or quarterly cycle,\\n\\nor if you prefer to think about it, a three month cycle.\\n\\nAnd then you define how many hours per week\\n\\nyou are going to spend pursuing that goal.\\n\\nAnd then you define how many hours per day\\n\\nyou are going to spend pursuing that goal.\\n\\nAnd then you define which days of the week\\n\\nyou are going to pursue that particular goal.\\n\\nI think those three numbers,\\n\\nthe 12 week quarterly, AKA three month cycle,\\n\\nthe number of hours per week\\n\\nand the number of hours per day and particular days\\n\\nthat you're going to spend working on a goal\\n\\nis going to be effective for 90%,\\n\\nif not more of different types of goals out there.\\n\\nAnd as with defining the specific goal itself,\\n\\nI highly recommend that you write this down\\n\\nwith a pen or pencil.\\n\\nThere's just oh, so much data to support the fact\\n\\nthat writing things down ideally in complete sentences\\n\\non a piece of paper with a pen or pencil\\n\\nserves to reinforce the goal setting and pursuit process,\\n\\ngreatly increasing the probability\\n\\nthat you will achieve those goals.\\n\\nSo what you're really defining in that process\\n\\nare the specific verb actions that you are going to take\\n\\nand the specific quantifiable amount of time\\n\\nthat you are engaging in those verb actions\\n\\nin order to achieve your goal.\\n\\nWhat we haven't discussed yet, however,\\n\\nis how to define or quantify the goal itself.\\n\\nNow, of course, in different endeavors,\\n\\nyou're going to have the opportunity to quantify\\n\\nand define goal achievement in different ways.\\n\\nSo for instance, if you want to be able to run\\n\\na sub six-minute mile or a sub five-minute mile,\\n\\nor if you're really impressive, a sub four-minute mile,\\n\\nwell, that's a highly quantifiable goal\\n\\nthat you can break down into a series of training steps\\n\\nor milestones, meaning that you could quantify\\n\\nat the beginning of your goal pursuit\\n\\nhow long it takes you to run a mile.\\n\\nYou could then set out to achieve a faster time\\n\\nwithin two weeks or three weeks\\n\\nand then do the appropriate training\\n\\nto achieve those numbers and simply keep updating that\\n\\nin order to eventually reach your quantifiable goal\\n\\nat 12 weeks.\\n\\nAgain, you might not complete your goal\\n\\nof running a sub five-minute mile or sub six-minute mile\\n\\nat the end of 12 weeks, but perhaps if your goal\\n\\nis to be able to run a sub five-minute mile\\n\\nby the end of the calendar year,\\n\\nand you're initiating this whole goal pursuit thing\\n\\non the first of the year, well, then you have 12 months\\n\\nbroken into four three-month cycles,\\n\\nand you would essentially set the quantifiable goal\\n\\nat the end of the year, December 31st,\\n\\nperhaps is when you actually do that run\\n\\nwhere you hopefully would achieve that sub six-minute\\n\\nor five-minute mile or maybe even four-minute mile,\\n\\nand then you backtrack from that date\\n\\nand you set milestones of goals\\n\\nthat you're trying to achieve.\\n\\nThat's a highly quantifiable set of goals\\n\\nbecause it is literally distance over time.\\n\\nHowever, in a lot of pursuits, in fact,\\n\\nI would argue in most pursuits,\\n\\nyou don't have that very clear quantifiable result.\\n\\nYou might have, for instance, the achievement\\n\\nof a doctoral degree or a bachelor's degree\\n\\nor an AA degree or a professional degree of some sort,\\n\\nwhich represents a finish line.\\n\\nYou could perhaps even attach a grade point average\\n\\nor a publication goal to that,\\n\\nbut in most endeavors that aren't athletic\\n\\nor aren't within the realm of finance,\\n\\nit becomes much harder to very clearly define your goal\\n\\nin purely quantitative terms.\\n\\nSo that is the reason why we spent so much time\\n\\ntalking about the measurability\\n\\nof the specific amount of time\\n\\nthat you're going to engage in the verb actions\\n\\nthat each day, which days, each week,\\n\\nover the course of these 12-week cycles,\\n\\nbecause ultimately what's going to allow you to arrive\\n\\nat successful achievement of your goal,\\n\\nregardless of whether or not that goal\\n\\nis highly quantifiable, X number of dollars,\\n\\nX number of minutes to complete a mile run or swim, et cetera,\\n\\nor it's something that's a bit more nebulous\\n\\nin terms of quantifiability, like conversational French.\\n\\nThere's conversational French that you can learn.\\n\\nThere's also conversational French that incorporates humor\\n\\nor that incorporates good humor,\\n\\nor perhaps you want to get better at writing poetry\\n\\nor simply spend time writing poetry.\\n\\nCan you quantify the quality of that poetry?\\n\\nWell, perhaps you could win a particular prize for poetry,\\n\\nbut I think for most endeavors,\\n\\nthey are more loosely defined\\n\\nin terms of their quantifiability.\\n\\nNow, we can always attach quantifiability\\n\\nto the ultimate end goal if we choose.\\n\\nSo for instance, I could decide\\n\\nthat I'm going to learn conversational French\\n\\nand I could decide that the ultimate goal\\n\\nat the end of this 12-week period\\n\\nis to be able to have a 10-minute conversation\\n\\nwith somebody who is fluent in French,\\n\\nthey're native born in France,\\n\\nand that I'm going to make zero mistakes.\\n\\nAnd that's a pretty lofty goal.\\n\\nBut the point being that if you are picking a goal\\n\\nthat is not easily quantifiable,\\n\\nyou want to be exceptionally precise\\n\\nabout the amount of time that you are going to spend\\n\\nengaging in the specific verb actions\\n\\nthat are going to allow you\\n\\nto make progress toward your goal.\\n\\nBecause ultimately,\\n\\nwhether or not it's a highly quantifiable goal\\n\\nor it's a more loosely quantifiable goal\\n\\nin terms of the end goal,\\n\\nthe process of achieving goals\\n\\nis always going to be in the form of actions.\\n\\nAnd actions themselves are always quantifiable.\\n\\nIt's number of hours of dedicated work\\n\\ntoward that particular goal.\\n\\nA common example of an end goal\\n\\nthat's very hard to quantify in terms of the end goal itself\\n\\nis the writing of a book, for instance.\\n\\nNow, you could set out to write an 800-page book,\\n\\nbut most people agree that the length of the book\\n\\nshould have something more or less to do with the content\\n\\nand not the other way around.\\n\\nIn other words, that you don't just want to add words\\n\\nin order to achieve a certain number of pages.\\n\\nThat said, most all experienced writers\\n\\nwill tell you at least two things.\\n\\nThey'll tell you, first, don't wait for inspiration.\\n\\nSimply set a period of time each day\\n\\nthat you're going to write\\n\\nand write X number of words\\n\\nor for X amount of time each day,\\n\\nor perhaps even just three days a week.\\n\\nBut most of the experienced writers that I've spoken to\\n\\nwrite every single day,\\n\\nand they write 800 words per day or 2000 words per day\\n\\nor 500 words per day, whatever they can do consistently.\\n\\nThey may do it for time, they may do it for words,\\n\\nbut they are writing during that time.\\n\\nThey are not waiting for inspiration to land on them.\\n\\nThey're not trying to get optimally caffeinated,\\n\\nand perhaps they didn't even sleep that well\\n\\nthe night before.\\n\\nIn other words, they are dedicated to engaging\\n\\nin a particular number of hours of word-generating action\\n\\nrather than trying to focus on getting\\n\\nthe number one bestseller at the end\\n\\nafter the book is published.\\n\\nOf course, they can wish for that number one position\\n\\non the bestseller chart.\\n\\nBut ultimately, the greatest probability\\n\\nof achieving that goal is going to come\\n\\nfrom engaging in a particular number of hours,\\n\\ngenerating a particular number of words each day.\\n\\nSo again, the highest probability of achieving our goals,\\n\\nof achieving any kind of goal,\\n\\nis going to be by understanding the specific verb actions\\n\\nthat we need to engage in\\n\\nand then quantifying the amount of time\\n\\nthat we engage in those specific word actions,\\n\\nand then simply doing those verbs.\\n\\nSo up until now, we've been talking about goal setting,\\n\\nand we really haven't talked about goal pursuit itself.\\n\\nSo now I'd like to talk about\\n\\nwhat the scientific literature says is the best protocol\\n\\nfor initiating our goal pursuit,\\n\\nfor starting toward our goal.\\n\\nAnd to do so, we have to address a set of key questions.\\n\\nThe questions you have to ask yourself are,\\n\\ndo I want to pursue this goal?\\n\\nMeaning, am I highly motivated to pursue this goal\\n\\nor even mildly motivated to pursue this goal?\\n\\nDo I want to do the things involved to get this thing,\\n\\nto accomplish this thing?\\n\\nOr am I feeling resistance?\\n\\nDo I not want to pursue this goal?\\n\\nOr perhaps this is a day-to-day shift that occurs\\n\\nwhere some days you're really motivated\\n\\nand other days you are not.\\n\\nNow, the reason to ask yourself this set of questions\\n\\nis that the data say that there are two different strategies,\\n\\nin fact, two markedly different strategies\\n\\nthat you'll want to incorporate\\n\\ndepending on whether or not you're motivated\\n\\nor you are unmotivated to pursue that particular goal\\n\\nfor whatever reason.\\n\\nAnd of course, there's an entire psychology to motivation\\n\\nand you could get a therapist or a coach to work with\\n\\nin order to address that underlying psychology.\\n\\nYes, it might ladder back to childhood issues.\\n\\nIt might ladder back to esteem things.\\n\\nNone of that can be covered here\\n\\nin any sort of meaningful depth\\n\\nbecause frankly, we each have different circumstances,\\n\\ndifferent pasts, different psychologies.\\n\\nThere are, however, some universals\\n\\nthat we can all apply in order to help us get started\\n\\ntoward our goal.\\n\\nAnd this is nested in this whole concept\\n\\nof whether or not we should visualize the end\\n\\nand successful completion of our goal.\\n\\nSo keep the end in mind as we start off toward a goal\\n\\nor whether or not we should incorporate a different strategy.\\n\\nHere's how it goes.\\n\\nSo if you ask yourself, do I want to achieve this goal?\\n\\nAnd I would hope the answer is yes\\n\\nbecause the overall goal should be something\\n\\nthat you want to pursue.\\n\\nIt should be something that you are\\n\\ndeeply desiring to accomplish.\\n\\nThen you have to ask yourself next,\\n\\ndo I want to do the things required to achieve that goal?\\n\\nNow, maybe you don't want to do all of them.\\n\\nYou only want to do some of them.\\n\\nBut given that you've now carefully quantified\\n\\nwhich specific actions you're going to be doing\\n\\non which days and for how many hours\\n\\nand how many weeks for these 12-week blocks,\\n\\nyou could simply ask yourself,\\n\\ndo I want to do this thing today?\\n\\nAnd if the answer is yes,\\n\\nwell, then it turns out that spending just one to three,\\n\\nmaybe five minutes, but even just one minute,\\n\\nvisualizing the outcome, the positive outcome, of course,\\n\\nand the feeling state that you may have,\\n\\nbecause of course you don't know,\\n\\nyou don't have a time machine,\\n\\nyou can't feel yourself into the future,\\n\\nbut you can make a good guess\\n\\nas to how you might feel in the future\\n\\nif you accomplish that goal.\\n\\nSpending one to three, maybe five minutes\\n\\nin a sort of meditation, although sort of a visualization\\n\\nis perhaps the better way to describe it.\\n\\nThinking about that feeling state and the outcome\\n\\nand some of the things that are going to be associated\\n\\nwith that outcome turns out to be a great practice\\n\\nto engage in just prior to initiating\\n\\nthat day's work toward that goal.\\n\\nHowever, if you arrive to your practice,\\n\\nmeaning you show up to the piano to learn piano,\\n\\nor you're sitting down to the table,\\n\\nor maybe you haven't even gotten enough motivation\\n\\nto go toward the piano or toward your notebook or computer\\n\\nor whatever landscape it is\\n\\nthat you are going to be pursuing your goal within,\\n\\nand you are having quote unquote a hard time\\n\\ngetting motivated toward that goal,\\n\\nwell, then it turns out\\n\\nwhat the scientific literature tells us\\n\\nis that visualizing the end, keeping the end in mind,\\n\\npositive visualization of all the good things\\n\\nthat you'll experience when you achieve that goal\\n\\nis not going to be an effective strategy to motivate you.\\n\\nRather, if you are not feeling motivated,\\n\\nthen what the scientific literature tells us\\n\\nis that you actually want to spend one to three,\\n\\nmaybe five minutes visualizing failure,\\n\\nvisualizing how terrible you will feel\\n\\nif you do not achieve your goal,\\n\\nvisualizing severe consequences,\\n\\nperhaps mostly of the sort like telling yourself,\\n\\ngosh, I set a goal, I've set a 12-week block,\\n\\nI quantify it, I know I want to do this,\\n\\nhere I have the time to do it,\\n\\nand I'm simply just not doing it.\\n\\nAnd in that case, you would think, okay, well,\\n\\nyou should kind of build yourself up,\\n\\nmaybe call a friend, text a friend, get some encouragement.\\n\\nNo, the scientific literature tells us\\n\\nthat when we are not motivated\\n\\nand it is a goal that we actually want to pursue,\\n\\nand of course, here I'm talking about adaptive goal pursuit,\\n\\nmeaning things that are going to enrich your mental health,\\n\\nphysical health, et cetera,\\n\\nnot things that are going to be detrimental to us,\\n\\nwell, then if you're not feeling motivated,\\n\\nyou want to spend one to three, perhaps five minutes\\n\\nmeditating, concentrating on\\n\\nwhat it's going to feel like to fail\\n\\nand the fact that you are not succeeding,\\n\\nbut indeed that you are failing.\\n\\nAnd I know this sounds like rather harsh advice\\n\\nthat this protocol sounds like kind of\\n\\na self-flagellating protocol.\\n\\nIt's not intended to be self-flagellation.\\n\\nIn fact, it should not be self-flagellation,\\n\\nbut rather what you want to do when you are not motivated\\n\\nis to think about failure and what that failure\\n\\nat the end of 12 weeks will feel like.\\n\\nAnd the reason for that is that the data tell us\\n\\nthat when we visualize positive outcomes,\\n\\nyes, it deploys certain neurochemicals in our brain\\n\\nand body that make us feel good.\\n\\nAlthough frankly, if you've heard that imagining something\\n\\ncreates the same neurochemical and neural circuit states\\n\\nin the brain as actually experiencing that thing,\\n\\nthat is simply not true.\\n\\nThat's a myth.\\n\\nWe've talked about this in previous episodes.\\n\\nThat's simply not true.\\n\\nBut if you are having a hard time getting motivated\\n\\ntoward a goal that you actually want to achieve,\\n\\nthen spending that short amount of time\\n\\nthinking about how lousy you'll feel\\n\\nwhen you don't achieve it,\\n\\nrecruits certain elements\\n\\nof your so-called autonomic nervous system.\\n\\nIt creates shifts in the release\\n\\nof things like epinephrine, norepinephrine,\\n\\neven release of the so-called reward molecule, dopamine,\\n\\nwhich in fact is not the molecule of reward.\\n\\nIt is the molecule of motivation\\n\\nand it's associated with pain.\\n\\nIt's associated with negative thoughts.\\n\\nAnd of course, it's associated\\n\\nwith positive thoughts and outcomes.\\n\\nBut basically what I'm saying is\\n\\nif you are highly motivated to do something,\\n\\nyou're ready to go, spend one to three minutes, maybe five,\\n\\nvisualizing the positive outcomes\\n\\nthat you're going to experience\\n\\nwhen you ultimately finish out that 12-week cycle\\n\\nas a consequence of all the great work that you've done.\\n\\nIf, however, you are not motivated,\\n\\nyou're feeling like, I don't want to do this thing.\\n\\nI'm procrastinating.\\n\\nI'm just not feeling like doing it.\\n\\nYes, I want to achieve the goal,\\n\\nbut I just don't feel like doing it.\\n\\nWell, then your task is to take one to three,\\n\\nmaybe five minutes,\\n\\nand think about how much more lousy you will feel\\n\\nwhen you do not achieve that goal at the end of 12 weeks.\\n\\nAnd that, the data tell us,\\n\\nrecruits certain elements of your nervous system,\\n\\nyour hormonal system that are more successful\\n\\nin getting you into action,\\n\\ninto starting toward your goal\\n\\nthan were you to try and build yourself up\\n\\ntowards all that positivity.\\n\\nSo yes, indeed, there is a place for negative thinking.\\n\\nI'd like to take a quick break\\n\\nand acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker.\\n\\nInsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform\\n\\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\\n\\nto help you better understand your body\\n\\nand help you meet your health goals.\\n\\nI'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done\\n\\nfor the simple reason that many of the factors\\n\\nthat impact your immediate and long-term health\\n\\ncan only be analyzed from a quality blood test.\\n\\nHowever, with a lot of blood tests out there,\\n\\nyou get information back about blood lipids,\\n\\nabout hormones and so on,\\n\\nbut you don't know what to do with that information.\\n\\nWith InsideTracker, they have a personalized platform\\n\\nthat makes it very easy to understand your data,\\n\\nthat is to understand what those lipids,\\n\\nwhat those hormone levels, et cetera, mean,\\n\\nand behavioral supplement nutrition and other protocols\\n\\nto adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges\\n\\nthat are ideal for your immediate and long-term health.\\n\\nInsideTracker's ultimate plan now includes measures\\n\\nof both ApoB and of insulin,\\n\\nwhich are key indicators of cardiovascular health\\n\\nand energy regulation.\\n\\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\\n\\nyou can visit

both initiate\\n\\nand to sustain effort during your goal pursuit process,\\n\\nwe need to think about the specific time domain\\n\\nor the amount of time that we're trying to do that within.\\n\\nSo for instance, there are tools that you can use\\n\\nto stay motivated within the one hour learning block\\n\\nthat you happen to be doing on Monday morning, for instance.\\n\\nAnd there are other tools and protocols\\n\\nthat you can incorporate towards staying motivated\\n\\nfrom one day to the next or from one week to the next.\\n\\nBut I think the most useful of those tools\\n\\nare going to be the tools that you incorporate\\n\\nto stay motivated within a given training block\\n\\nor practice block toward your goal.\\n\\nBecause what I just described a few minutes ago\\n\\nwas the process of how to initiate your daily work, right?\\n\\nYou ask yourself that question, am I motivated?\\n\\nThe answer could be yes, could be no.\\n\\nIf you really want to get quantitative about it,\\n\\nyou could give yourself a one to 10 score,\\n\\n10 being the most motivated.\\n\\nFrankly, I'm not that quantitative about that sort of thing.\\n\\nI'm more subjective about it.\\n\\nBut I know some of you are real number junkies\\n\\nand you really like to quantify everything,\\n\\nkeep a journal and look back,\\n\\nsee how that relates to your sleep.\\n\\nSome people are of that orientation.\\n\\nOther people like myself are simply going to sit down\\n\\nand say, okay, it's time, it's time to train\\n\\nor it's time to practice, whatever the thing may be.\\n\\nHow motivated am I?\\n\\nAm I, I don't know, like a six out of 10\\n\\nor a seven out of 10, okay, I'm ready to go.\\n\\nI'm going to visualize the end in mind in a positive way.\\n\\nOr if I'm a two out of 10\\n\\nor anything less than a four out of 10,\\n\\nI'm thinking I'm not that motivated.\\n\\nSo then I'm going to basically scare myself\\n\\ninto doing the work that day.\\n\\nSo that's how you initiate the work each day.\\n\\nAnd I just gave you a couple of quick examples\\n\\nof how you could quantify that.\\n\\nTook me about 30 seconds to do that example out loud.\\n\\nTake you about 30 seconds to do.\\n\\nBut again, if you want to quantify it in more detail\\n\\nand write it down and relate it to other things,\\n\\nbe my guest.\\n\\nSo now you already have a science-based protocol\\n\\nfor how to get started each day toward your goal.\\n\\nNow, what about within the one or two hour block\\n\\nor perhaps 90 minute block that you're going to use\\n\\nto pursue your goal?\\n\\nAnd here, it's very important that you have a number\\n\\nof tools that will allow you\\n\\nto both set the optimal amount of focus\\n\\nso that you're really concentrating on pursuing that goal.\\n\\nYou're concentrated on the verb actions\\n\\nthat will deliver you to that goal\\n\\nis perhaps the best way to state that.\\n\\nAnd that you can constantly update\\n\\nor renew your level of focus should it start to dissipate.\\n\\nNow, I want to be clear,\\n\\nI've done entire episodes about focus\\n\\nand how to increase focus with behavioral tools,\\n\\neverything related to meditation,\\n\\nwhich indeed can increase your ability to focus.\\n\\nI've talked about nutritional tools,\\n\\nsupplementation tools, prescription drug related tools.\\n\\nThere's a lot of information on that.\\n\\nYou can simply go to hubermanlab.com,\\n\\nput focus into the search function\\n\\nand it will take you to not only those episodes\\n\\nand the toolkit for that,\\n\\nbut the specific timestamps for that.\\n\\nBut what we are going to talk about now\\n\\nis not about how to increase focus per se,\\n\\nrather it's about how to use focus\\n\\nin particular visual focus in order to increase your\\n\\nor maintain your level of motivation\\n\\nwithin a given learning block,\\n\\nwithin a given batch of time on a given day\\n\\nwhere you are pursuing your goal.\\n\\nYou're engaging in that practice,\\n\\nwhich of course will include frustration, anxiety.\\n\\nIt has to, if you're going to get any better\\n\\nand how to set that motivation\\n\\nand keep that motivation throughout that hour\\n\\nor 90 minutes or two hours is critical.\\n\\nSo how do you do that?\\n\\nWell, it turns out it's fairly straightforward.\\n\\nSo it's anchored in the fact that your cognitive focus,\\n\\nyour ability to maintain a narrow cone of attention,\\n\\nas well as your bodily state of readiness\\n\\nand your mental state of readiness to perform work\\n\\nis powerfully anchored to your visual system.\\n\\nAs many of you have heard me say before,\\n\\nyour eyes are actually two pieces of brain.\\n\\nI mean, to be more specific,\\n\\nthe neural retinas that line the back of your eyes\\n\\nlike pie crusts are literally two pieces\\n\\nof your central nervous system of your brain\\n\\nthat were extruded from the cranial vault\\n\\nduring development.\\n\\nSo yes, these two bits, and for those listening,\\n\\nI'm just pointing to my eyes.\\n\\nYour eyes are two pieces of brain outside of your skull\\n\\nand your eyes can view things broadly.\\n\\nSo you can so-called soften your gaze\\n\\nand view the entire horizon.\\n\\nYou can see the periphery of the room by relaxing your eyes.\\n\\nYou can actually do this now.\\n\\nIn fact, when you drive,\\n\\nmost of the time you're doing this,\\n\\nyou're not looking at a particular focal point\\n\\nbecause you're viewing things in so-called panoramic vision.\\n\\nAnd of course you can draw your visual focus\\n\\nto a particular location,\\n\\nwhat we call a virgin's eye movement.\\n\\nThat is you're bringing your eyes in toward the center,\\n\\ntoward your nose a little bit,\\n\\nand you're focusing them in a more narrow cone\\n\\nof visual attention.\\n\\nThis is something you can do almost imperceptibly\\n\\nto others, although if we were to measure your eye movements,\\n\\nwhat we would see is that your eyes are actually moving\\n\\ninward a little bit toward your nose.\\n\\nWhen you do this virgin's eye movement\\n\\nand narrowing that cone of visual attention,\\n\\nand then they're relaxing into a state\\n\\nof being slightly further out from your nose,\\n\\nnot the eyes themselves, of course,\\n\\nthey can't move within the sockets,\\n\\nbut the pupils of your eyes are moving out a bit\\n\\nfrom your nose and you're in so-called panoramic vision.\\n\\nSo essentially what I'm saying is that you can narrow\\n\\nor broaden your visual attention.\\n\\nAnd that's something that can take a little bit of practice.\\n\\nI highly recommend that you try this\\n\\nand that you practice it a little bit.\\n\\nBut indeed everyone has the neural machinery\\n\\nto do this from birth.\\n\\nThis is not something that requires neuroplasticity\\n\\nto be able to do.\\n\\nYou can do this right now.\\n\\nYou can narrow your visual attention.\\n\\nYou can expand or relax your visual attention\\n\\nand thereby narrow or relax your visual field\\n\\nfrom being smaller or larger.\\n\\nThere are data that show\\n\\nthat when we narrow our visual attention\\n\\nand we hold that narrow visual attention on a spot,\\n\\nseveral things happen.\\n\\nFirst of all, there's recruitment of circuitry\\n\\nwithin the so-called brainstem\\n\\nthat then deploys neurochemicals\\n\\nthat increase our level of alertness and arousal.\\n\\nThat's right, when you focus your visual attention\\n\\non a more narrow location or one location in front of you\\n\\nand you hold that focus,\\n\\nyou are causing the release of neurochemicals\\n\\nthat increase your overall level of alertness\\n\\nin the brain and body.\\n\\nConversely, when you relax your visual focus,\\n\\nso-called panoramic vision,\\n\\nyou are turning off that recruitment.\\n\\nYou're not actively recruiting molecules\\n\\nfor relaxation within the brain,\\n\\nbut you are turning off this release\\n\\nof the neurochemicals associated\\n\\nwith increasing focus and arousal.\\n\\nSo why am I talking about this\\n\\nin the context of goal pursuit?\\n\\nWell, if you are feeling lack of motivation at any point\\n\\nwithin a given training block or bout as I'm calling it,\\n\\nthis could be at the beginning,\\n\\nthis could be five minutes in,\\n\\nthis could be half an hour in,\\n\\nyou would be wise to pick a visual target,\\n\\nideally a visual target that is within the general range\\n\\nof the work that you're trying to perform.\\n\\nIn other words, if you're doing desk work\\n\\nor the piece of paper,\\n\\nyou would draw that visual target on a piece of paper,\\n\\napproximately the same distance that you were reading\\n\\nor that you were looking at music.\\n\\nYou can tell how little playing a piano I've done in my life,\\n\\nbut the point being that you set the visual target\\n\\nat approximately the same distance\\n\\nthat you would be performing your particular work.\\n\\nSo if you're doing a sport,\\n\\nthe distance might be some many meters off in the distance,\\n\\nwhereas if you're doing desk work of some kind,\\n\\nthen it might be much closer.\\n\\nAnd then you focus your eyes on that location\\n\\nand you actively work to maintain that focus,\\n\\njust like I'm doing now into the camera\\n\\nfor a given period of time.\\n\\nAnd I recommend that you set a timer\\n\\nand that you of course allow yourself to blink\\n\\nlike I just did there,\\n\\nand that you try and achieve at least 30 seconds,\\n\\nbut even better would be 60 seconds,\\n\\neven better would be 90 seconds\\n\\nof that focused virgin's eye movement,\\n\\nduring which several things happen,\\n\\nincluding the deployment of those neurochemicals\\n\\nfrom the brainstem that I talked about before,\\n\\nwhich are going to increase your level\\n\\nof autonomic arousal\\n\\nand also increase your level of focus further.\\n\\nAnd there I'm not just talking about visual focus,\\n\\nI'm talking about cognitive focus.\\n\\nIt has also been shown that when we focus\\n\\non a particular point in the way that I'm describing here,\\n\\nthat it increases our so-called systolic blood pressure.\\n\\nAs many of you know, blood pressure is always described\\n\\nto us as a given number over another number.\\n\\nAnd the first number is the so-called systole\\n\\nor systolic pressure,\\n\\nwhich is the amount of pressure in your vascular system\\n\\nwhen the heart beats as the fluid of your blood\\n\\nis pumping through the arteries, veins,\\n\\nand capillaries of your system.\\n\\nAnd then the bottom number is the amount of pressure\\n\\nwithin those arteries, veins, and capillaries\\n\\nin between heartbeat.\\n\\nSo it's the systolic over the diastolic.\\n\\nAnd what we know is that visual focus,\\n\\nand here I'm still holding mine now on the camera.\\n\\nSo for those of you listening,\\n\\nI probably blinked once or twice,\\n\\nbut I'm really trying hard to maintain my focus\\n\\ndirectly within the camera.\\n\\nThis visual focus increases the systolic blood pressure.\\n\\nIt increases the deployment of those neurochemicals\\n\\nfrom the brainstem.\\n\\nAnd we know it also can recruit the liberation\\n\\nof molecules such as dopamine\\n\\nand some associated molecules elsewhere in the brain\\n\\nthat together act in a synergistic way\\n\\nto increase our level of focus and motivation.\\n\\nThis is based again on work\\n\\ndescribing the neural circuitry of what I'm describing here\\n\\nand work from Emily Balchettis's lab,\\n\\nwhich has shown that if people focus on a target,\\n\\non a goal line, literally a physical location\\n\\nwithin their environment, and then they initiate some work,\\n\\nit could be physical work or cognitive work.\\n\\nNot only do they experience significantly decreased levels\\n\\nof perceived effort while engaging in that work,\\n\\nbut they also complete that work\\n\\nin a significantly reduced amount of time.\\n\\nMeaning that within a given training belt or training block,\\n\\nyou are able to get significantly more work done\\n\\nand you perceive that as less effortful\\n\\nor requiring less effort\\n\\nthan had you not done this visual focus.\\n\\nNow, I've been doing this for quite some time now\\n\\ninto the camera.\\n\\nThis is actually a practice that I've been doing\\n\\nfor well over a decade.\\n\\nAnd it's actually a practice that I use when I podcast\\n\\nor when I post on social media.\\n\\nIt's part of the reason why I'm accused\\n\\nof being a non-blinker quite often.\\n\\nBut I want to remind people that you are allowed to blink.\\n\\nDon't let your eyes dry out.\\n\\nIt's perfectly fine to blink.\\n\\nIt's not going to inhibit the effectiveness\\n\\nof this protocol.\\n\\nBut I don't think I can really overstate\\n\\nhow valuable this sort of protocol is.\\n\\nFirst of all, it's completely behavioral.\\n\\nIt costs nothing.\\n\\nIt's completely safe as long as you remember to blink.\\n\\nAnd it allows you to increase your level of focus,\\n\\nyour level of motivation and the sustainability\\n\\nof your focus and motivation while in goal pursuit.\\n\\nSo it's a quite valuable protocol to incorporate.\\n\\nAnd it's something that you can do once for 30 seconds\\n\\nand then lean into whatever it is,\\n\\nyour writing process, your running process.\\n\\nIt's something that you could do repeatedly\\n\\nthroughout that learning bout.\\n\\nAnd it's something that you can practice offline\\n\\na little bit away from that training bout\\n\\nas a means to sort of learn and get familiar with\\n\\nso that then you can incorporate it very quickly\\n\\nand repeatedly and with much more effectiveness\\n\\nduring these different learning bouts.\\n\\nAgain, it's a highly valuable tool that's grounded\\n\\nin neural circuitry, grounded in neurochemistry\\n\\nand that Emily Balchitis' lab has shown\\n\\nin numerous domains, physical pursuits,\\n\\ncognitive pursuits can really help people achieve\\n\\ntheir goals and to achieve them more easily\\n\\nor at least with less perceived effort and more quickly.\\n\\nNow we can get a bit more granular\\n\\nabout the incorporation of this tool, this protocol.\\n\\nBut before we do, we should acknowledge\\n\\nthat all of the things that lend themselves\\n\\nto improved cognitive focus and physical ability\\n\\nstill hold true, right?\\n\\nYou still need to get good sleep\\n\\nas many nights of your life as you possibly can.\\n\\nYou still need to eat properly.\\n\\nYou still need to try and limit your stress.\\n\\nWe have podcast episodes related to all of those topics.\\n\\nWe have toolkits available at zero cost\\n\\nrelated to all of those topics.\\n\\nI'm not saying that this visual focus\\n\\nor visual target training is the only tool\\n\\nthat you should incorporate.\\n\\nIt's a tool that you want to superimpose\\n\\non the foundation of all the things\\n\\nthat bring you to your practice\\n\\nwith the best possible cognition,\\n\\nthe best possible physical readiness.\\n\\nAnd that when added to that foundation of excellent sleep,\\n\\nexcellent nutrition, social connection,\\n\\nsunlight in the morning, et cetera,\\n\\nis going to increase the probability\\n\\nthat you're going to make those learning bouts\\n\\nas effective as possible.\\n\\nNow, some of you may be thinking,\\n\\nelevating your blood pressure is bad.\\n\\nWhy would I want to elevate my blood pressure?\\n\\nAh, well, it turns out that the increases\\n\\nin systolic blood pressure achieved\\n\\nwith this visual target training\\n\\nor focusing on a finish line for some period of time\\n\\nare transient and they are perfectly safe.\\n\\nSo essentially what it does is it boosts\\n\\nor bolsters the activity of the autonomic nervous system.\\n\\nIt kickstarts the deployment of those chemicals\\n\\nand those neural circuits that then allow you\\n\\nto be motivated for some period of time.\\n\\nBut then that is a transient increase in autonomic arousal,\\n\\nwhich is why perhaps every 20 minutes\\n\\nor perhaps on the hour, you might stop,\\n\\ndo a 30 second or 60 second visual target training,\\n\\nthen lean back into your process\\n\\nof however it is that you are pursuing your goal.\\n\\nI should also mention that if your eyes are getting tired\\n\\ndoing whatever goal pursuit you happen to be engaged in,\\n\\nit's also a good idea to go into that panoramic vision mode.\\n\\nThe easiest way to do that is to go outside\\n\\nor to be outside and to view a horizon\\n\\nand not look at any one particular point on the horizon.\\n\\nBut if you're indoors, as I am now,\\n\\nyou can also just relax your eyes,\\n\\nyou know, sort of blinking a few times\\n\\nand getting rid of that virgin's eye movement\\n\\nand try and visualize the corners of the room\\n\\nor the sides of the room rather,\\n\\nthe floor and the ceiling all at once.\\n\\nThat's a good way to explain how to so-called relax your eyes\\n\\nand take you out of that virgin's eye movement.\\n\\nAnd I say this because a lot of people will feel\\n\\nwhen they're pursuing their goal,\\n\\nthat it's kind of fatiguing.\\n\\nSo you have to remember to breathe, right?\\n\\nYou still want to breathe as you're pursuing your goal\\n\\nand you certainly want to be visually focused on your goal.\\n\\nSo you're cognitively focused on your goal\\n\\nand you're motivated, but that from time to time,\\n\\nyou also relax, take a moment, shake things off,\\n\\nlook into your panoramic vision mode\\n\\nand then go back to your mode of goal pursuit.\\n\\nNow, there are a few other protocols\\n\\nthat might seem oh so simple,\\n\\nbut frankly are oh so effective\\n\\nthat I'd be remiss if I didn't mention them.\\n\\nThe first of those is actually something\\n\\nthat I'm borrowing from Tim Ferriss\\n\\nwho did a post on Instagram, which we will link to,\\n\\nwhich I think is just spectacular,\\n\\nwhich is 30 things that he wished he had known\\n\\nwhen he was 20.\\n\\nAnd while the internet is chock-a-block full of such lists,\\n\\nthat particular list is truly impressive.\\n\\nThose are things that I too wish I had known when I was 20,\\n\\nbut also when I was 30 and 40 and so on.\\n\\nBut one particular thing on that list of 30\\n\\nis particularly relevant now,\\n\\nwhich is that the best productivity app\\n\\nis already on your phone,\\n\\nwhich is to put your phone into airplane mode\\n\\nor more ideally, and this is the one that I try my best\\n\\nto incorporate, to simply turn the phone off\\n\\nand remove it from my workouts or my attempts\\n\\nto learn language or my attempts to learn anything.\\n\\nI realize that some people need to keep their phone\\n\\nwith them for reasons related to communicating\\n\\nwith family or coworkers, et cetera.\\n\\nThat's fine if you need your phone,\\n\\nbut to the extent that you can remove yourself\\n\\nfrom distractions, that's certainly going\\n\\nto enhance your ability to focus on what you need\\n\\nto focus on in pursuing your goals.\\n\\nThat sort of stands without saying, it's kind of a duh.\\n\\nAnd yet I think a lot of people are searching far and wide\\n\\nfor the productivity app, for the secret hack,\\n\\nfor the thing that's going to allow them to be productive.\\n\\nAnd oftentimes there are do's, actions that we can take\\n\\nin order to become more productive.\\n\\nWe're talking about some of those today.\\n\\nWe've talked about those in other episodes,\\n\\nbut there are, of course, important don'ts.\\n\\nSo don't have your phone facing up with Wi-Fi\\n\\nand seller service on if you want to be productive\\n\\nat something that doesn't involve your phone.\\n\\nIdeally, you'll turn it over, you'll turn it off,\\n\\nyou'll get rid of it, you'll put it in the next room.\\n\\nIf you're like me, you'll sometimes lock it in the car.\\n\\nI think the most extreme that I've ever gone to ensure\\n\\nthat I didn't engage with my phone during goal pursuit\\n\\nwas during the early days of having my laboratory\\n\\nand I was writing multiple grants in parallel,\\n\\nwhich is an immense amount of work.\\n\\nI would walk into the laboratory in the morning\\n\\nand I would hand a student or postdoc my phone\\n\\nand I'd say, don't give this back to me until 5 p.m.\\n\\nAnd if I ask for it back, if I even ask for it once,\\n\\neveryone in the lab gets $500.\\n\\nThere were quite a few people in my lab\\n\\nand so it's a significant cost to that.\\n\\nAnd I must tell you, there were numerous times\\n\\nthroughout the day when I impulsively just thought,\\n\\nokay, I'm going to need my phone.\\n\\nDamn it, I don't want to have to do it.\\n\\nAnd I also wanted to demonstrate to them\\n\\nthat I could create an incentive system\\n\\nwhereby I could basically scruff myself\\n\\ninto getting the work done.\\n\\nAnd indeed, much to their dismay,\\n\\nI never once had to pay them out.\\n\\nAlthough when we got the grants\\n\\nand indeed, even when we didn't get the grants,\\n\\nI did take them all to dinner.\\n\\nNow, another key protocol for maintaining motivation\\n\\nwhile pursuing your goals stems from our understanding\\n\\nof the dopamine reward and motivation pathways.\\n\\nTopics for which I have done multiple, indeed,\\n\\nthree podcast episodes previously,\\n\\nand we can provide a link to all three of those\\n\\nas well as the toolkit that we've published\\n\\nand that's available to you at zero cost on our website\\n\\nabout how to regulate dopamine,\\n\\nboth baseline dopamine stores and peaks in dopamine.\\n\\nThere's a lot there to be understood and incorporated\\n\\nbecause it has to do with various things,\\n\\nnot just in the realm of goal pursuit,\\n\\nbut also feelings of wellbeing,\\n\\nstaving off depression, things of that sort.\\n\\nThe dopamine system is linked to,\\n\\noh, so many important aspects of life.\\n\\nFar too many than we could discuss right now\\n\\nand we have those previous episodes\\n\\nin which we do discuss all of that material.\\n\\nNonetheless, it is important to understand\\n\\nthat dopamine is the molecule of motivation\\n\\nand to some extent reward, but really motivation,\\n\\nand that if you want to maintain consistent motivation\\n\\nduring, say, your individual bouts of work\\n\\ntoward your goals and from one bout to the next,\\n\\nso not just within a session,\\n\\nbut from day to day across sessions and from week to week,\\n\\nand indeed from 12-week cycle to 12-week cycle,\\n\\nif that's required, and from one goal that you set\\n\\nto the next goal that you define and decide to pursue,\\n\\nyou want to understand this particular feature of dopamine,\\n\\nwhich is that yes, dopamine and its release\\n\\nis highly valuable toward getting more motivated\\n\\nand feeling more motivated,\\n\\nbut that it has certain properties related\\n\\nto things like dopamine reward prediction error,\\n\\nbaselines of dopamine, et cetera,\\n\\nthat make it the case that if you reward yourself\\n\\nevery time you reach a milestone,\\n\\nsay you finish out an hour or two hours of work,\\n\\nso you treat yourself to something, you reward yourself,\\n\\nthat you are going to diminish\\n\\nboth the potency of that reward\\n\\nand you're going to reduce your motivation over time.\\n\\nThat might be surprising to you,\\n\\nbut if you were to watch those episodes,\\n\\nit would all become clear as to why that is the case.\\n\\nIt is also true that if you were to only reward yourself\\n\\nwhen you accomplish your goal,\\n\\nor perhaps more commonly,\\n\\nif you look at the accomplishment of your goal\\n\\nas the only reward in the whole process of goal pursuit\\n\\nand achievement, that is going to undermine\\n\\nyour probability of success as well.\\n\\nRather, the best way to incorporate the mechanics\\n\\nof the dopamine system such that you can achieve\\n\\nnot just immediate motivation, but ongoing motivation\\n\\nis to incorporate what is referred to\\n\\nas random intermittent reinforcement,\\n\\nwhich is what the casinos use to keep people playing.\\n\\nAnd it simply means randomly reward yourself\\n\\nand randomly don't reward yourself\\n\\nfor successful completion of milestones.\\n\\nThose milestones could be within a bout of effort\\n\\nor it could be across bouts of effort.\\n\\nSo let's say you set out at the beginning\\n\\non your piece of paper to basically, let's say,\\n\\nrun or practice at some cognitive endeavor,\\n\\nfour hours total per week,\\n\\nand you're going to do that Monday, Wednesday, Friday,\\n\\nand Saturday.\\n\\nShould you reward yourself at the end of each session?\\n\\nShould you reward yourself at the end of each week?\\n\\nThe answer is it depends,\\n\\nand it should depend in a random intermittent way.\\n\\nSo the simplest way to do this\\n\\nis whenever you complete a milestone,\\n\\nit could be at the end of a day,\\n\\nyou did your one hour,\\n\\nwhatever it was that you designated you were going to do\\n\\non that particular day.\\n\\nShould you reward yourself cognitively\\n\\nor with some physical thing?\\n\\nI don't know what that physical thing might be,\\n\\nbut I don't know, it could be a meal,\\n\\ncould be a movie, could be something that you enjoy.\\n\\nWell, the answer is you should flip a coin.\\n\\nAnd if it's heads, yes, reward yourself.\\n\\nAnd if it's tails, don't.\\n\\nIt's that simple.\\n\\nIt is that simple.\\n\\nIt should be 50-50 probability,\\n\\nand it's random as to whether or not you reward yourself.\\n\\nNow, with physical rewards like monetary rewards\\n\\nor food rewards or a movie or participating\\n\\nin something else that you enjoy,\\n\\nit's a bit easier to define.\\n\\nThe cognitive rewarding of one's own efforts\\n\\nis something that people really struggle to comprehend.\\n\\nBut what I'm not referring to when I say cognitive rewards\\n\\nis I'm not referring to saying,\\n\\nyes, I'm the best,\\n\\nand really trying to shower yourself with internal praise\\n\\nand tell yourself\\n\\nthat you're the greatest thing that ever happened\\n\\nsimply because you performed this learning bout.\\n\\nWhat I'm simply referring to\\n\\nis the kind of internal dopamine reward\\n\\nthat comes from telling yourself,\\n\\nyes, I'm making progress.\\n\\nI'm making progress.\\n\\nI'm on the path.\\n\\nI'm able to set a goal and achieve a goal,\\n\\nwhich might seem like a healthy thing to do psychologically.\\n\\nAnd in fact, it is.\\n\\nIt's great, and I think it's really important\\n\\nthat people be able to self-reward themselves,\\n\\nespecially self-reward for verbs\\n\\nthat put them in a more adaptive stance in life,\\n\\nthat enhance their mental health,\\n\\nphysical health, and performance.\\n\\nAnd that, of course, also includes relationships.\\n\\nWe're not just talking about solitary pursuits here.\\n\\nWe're talking about pursuits that bring us into the world,\\n\\nthat allow us to lean into life with more vigor\\n\\nand with more effectiveness,\\n\\nnot just to help ourselves, but to help others.\\n\\nSo what I'm referring to is completing something\\n\\nand internally patting yourself on the back\\n\\nfor having completed that thing.\\n\\nThat is a good thing to do,\\n\\nbut if you want to maintain ongoing motivation,\\n\\nyou're not going to do that every time.\\n\\nYou're not going to punish yourself,\\n\\nbut rather you finish out a bout of learning.\\n\\nYou flip the coin.\\n\\nLet's say it lands tails.\\n\\nOn that day, you simply shift into the next thing\\n\\nyou need to do that day.\\n\\nNow, it is not easy to suppress thoughts.\\n\\nWe know this.\\n\\nIt's very hard to suppress negative thoughts,\\n\\nbut it's still hard to suppress positive thoughts.\\n\\nSo internally, if you're glowing\\n\\nfrom the fact that you performed well,\\n\\ndon't try and suppress that.\\n\\nThat's okay.\\n\\nBut if you flip a tail,\\n\\nthen you don't want to actively engage\\n\\nin a self-reward process.\\n\\nHowever, if you flip the coin and its heads,\\n\\nwell, then you should absolutely\\n\\nengage in a self-reward process.\\n\\nAnd that process should consist of 30 to 60 seconds\\n\\nof closing your eyes.\\n\\nWell, you don't have to.\\n\\nIt works better if you close your eyes\\n\\nand simply thinking about the fact that, yes,\\n\\nyou can set a goal.\\n\\nYou can engage in the specific set of questions.\\n\\nDo I want to do this practice today?\\n\\nDo I not want to do this practice today?\\n\\nAnd then the specific set of actions,\\n\\nmaybe they involve visual focus\\n\\nand the other tools we talked about,\\n\\nturning off of your phone, et cetera.\\n\\nYou are somebody who can get things done.\\n\\nYou are somebody that is moving forward\\n\\ntoward your particular goal.\\n\\nAnd so you just sort of create a little bit\\n\\nof a positive cognitive loop around that ability\\n\\nthat you are in fact building up.\\n\\nAnd that's something that people often overlook,\\n\\nwhich is that not only is moving toward a goal great\\n\\nbecause it establishes more robustness\\n\\nin the neural circuits\\n\\nthat allow us to perform that thing, right?\\n\\nI mean, after all, that's what learning is.\\n\\nEventually you don't achieve the same frustration\\n\\nand errors that you do when trying to perform that thing.\\n\\nEventually you learn how to play the piano.\\n\\nYou learn how to speak conversational French.\\n\\nYou run that sub six minute mile,\\n\\nbut also the neural circuits associated\\n\\nwith self-generated motivation.\\n\\nAnd with the tools that we're talking about,\\n\\nthemselves are subject to neuroplasticity.\\n\\nSo those become more robust and that's fantastic\\n\\nbecause when you eventually reach one goal,\\n\\nI would hope that you would then update\\n\\nand set out to achieve another goal.\\n\\nAnd you will find that over time,\\n\\nyou will be more effective in achieving other goals\\n\\nby virtue of the work that you did\\n\\nin pursuing a previous goal.\\n\\nBecause ultimately it's really about defining goals\\n\\nand then learning how to quantify the actions required\\n\\nand then engaging in those actions.\\n\\nSo there's the specific circuits involved\\n\\nin generating those actions, which are very goal specific.\\n\\nAnd then there are the circuits,\\n\\nwhich circuits are we talking about?\\n\\nWe're talking about that amygdala,\\n\\nthe lateral prefrontal cortex,\\n\\nthe orbital frontal cortex and the basal ganglia.\\n\\nWe talked about earlier that had been built up,\\n\\nthat had been reinforced because as I mentioned,\\n\\nthere is one universal circuit\\n\\nfor goal pursuit and achievement.\\n\\nSo random intermittent reinforcement is the key.\\n\\nAnd while I spent a good amount of time\\n\\ntalking about self-generated cognitive reinforcement,\\n\\nthis also applies to any kind of physical rewards.\\n\\nThe movie that you're going to reward yourself with,\\n\\nthe ice cream cone, the whatever\\n\\nthat you're going to reward yourself with.\\n\\nPerhaps it's monetary, perhaps it's food,\\n\\nperhaps it's social.\\n\\nRandom intermittent rewards are the ones\\n\\nthat are going to keep you motivated\\n\\nand are going to best increase the probability of success,\\n\\nnot just within a given bout of learning,\\n\\nnot just day to day, not just week to week,\\n\\nnot just quarter to quarter, but across the lifetime.\\n\\nAn important protocol to incorporate\\n\\nin your goal pursuits is one that I learned\\n\\nfrom Dr. Maya Shankar when she was a guest\\n\\non the Huberman Lab podcast.\\n\\nAnd she talked about the so-called middle problem.\\n\\nThe middle problem is the fact\\n\\nthat people tend to have a lot of motivation\\n\\nat the outset of pursuing a goal.\\n\\nAlthough you now know that sometimes,\\n\\nor some people don't have a lot of motivation\\n\\nwhen pursuing their goal at the start.\\n\\nSo they need to think about failures\\n\\nand how terrible everything will be.\\n\\nAnd then they will certainly have motivation.\\n\\nIt's going to be a fear-based motivation.\\n\\nBut in general, people tend to have more motivation\\n\\nat the start of pursuing a goal.\\n\\nAnd at the end, when they get close to,\\n\\nor they start to perceive the finish line.\\n\\nBut that most people experience\\n\\nthe so-called middle problem,\\n\\nwhere in the middle of a learning bout,\\n\\nor in the middle of the week,\\n\\nor in the middle of a 12-week cycle,\\n\\nthey are less motivated.\\n\\nAnd this has actually been quantified in numerous studies.\\n\\nAnd there are several ways to overcome the middle problem.\\n\\nThe simplest one is to acknowledge it,\\n\\nto recognize that it's coming.\\n\\nAnd so when it does come\\n\\nand you're experiencing lower levels of motivation,\\n\\nperhaps even increased failure rates,\\n\\nand you're not performing as well,\\n\\nyou're getting frustrated,\\n\\nto know that that's a natural process\\n\\nthat everybody experiences.\\n\\nAnd just knowing that can sometimes allow people\\n\\nto move through that to the place\\n\\nwhere then they can sense the end of the learning bout,\\n\\nwhere they can sense that they're making some progress,\\n\\nthe finish line is there,\\n\\nand then they get that increase in motivation again.\\n\\nHowever, sometimes the middle problem is such a problem\\n\\nthat people need some tools to move through it.\\n\\nAnd the best way to move through the middle problem,\\n\\nor in fact to eliminate it,\\n\\nis actually to make the middle of a learning bout\\n\\nits own separate thing that you acknowledge the presence of\\n\\nand that you break up into three separate bouts.\\n\\nSo here we're talking about carving up\\n\\nthe one-hour learning bout or the two-hour learning bout\\n\\ninto an initial phase\\n\\nwhere you either have naturally occurring motivation\\n\\nor you use fear-based visualization\\n\\nto increase your motivation.\\n\\nYou lean into that.\\n\\nAnd then let's assume it's a one-hour learning bout.\\n\\nAnd then at about the 25-minute mark,\\n\\nyou start to experience lower levels of focus.\\n\\nPerhaps then you use the visual target protocol,\\n\\nbut then you go back into your bout of learning\\n\\nand you're not feeling very motivated.\\n\\nIt's hard. Your mind is drifting.\\n\\nYou want to pick up your phone.\\n\\nYou want to do other things.\\n\\nYou find yourself doing other things.\\n\\nThat's the period of time to take, say,\\n\\nthe 25-minute to 45-minute period within the session\\n\\nand divide it into perhaps three\\n\\nor even four smaller chunks of time.\\n\\nAnd you perhaps have heard of chunking before.\\n\\nChunking is simply breaking something down\\n\\ninto smaller chunks that are more achievable.\\n\\nIt's simply what we're talking about here.\\n\\nBut really chunking up that middle section of a learning bout\\n\\ncan be very effective at essentially eliminating\\n\\nthe middle problem.\\n\\nNow, for those of you that are going to be really nitpicky,\\n\\nyou'll say, wait, you take that 20 minutes\\n\\nfrom the 25-minute mark to the 45-minute mark\\n\\nwithin your hour learning bout,\\n\\nand you divide it up into four little chunks.\\n\\nAnd in those two middle chunks,\\n\\nI'm going to feel the middle problem\\n\\nfor those two middle chunks.\\n\\nWell, that's not actually the way it pans out.\\n\\nFortunately, when you break things down\\n\\ninto small enough chunks,\\n\\nyou eliminate the middle problem\\n\\nand you experience sustained motivation.\\n\\nNow, the extreme interpretation of that\\n\\nwould have you measuring every minute\\n\\nor even every second of a learning bout\\n\\nand having consistent motivation throughout that.\\n\\nBecause for instance, if you can concentrate for 10 seconds,\\n\\nwhy wouldn't you simply be able\\n\\nto just mark off 10-second increments?\\n\\nWell, at some point, the marking off\\n\\nor the monitoring of those increments\\n\\nis going to be distracting\\n\\ntoward the thing that you actually want to do.\\n\\nSo the simple thing to do\\n\\nis to acknowledge the middle problem, right?\\n\\nThe fact that we have more motivation at the start\\n\\nand at the end of our goal pursuit sessions\\n\\nthan we do within the middle,\\n\\nand then to simply chunk that middle section\\n\\ninto three, maybe four smaller chunks.\\n\\nAnd if you need to incorporate things\\n\\nlike the visual target protocol,\\n\\none or three or perhaps even eight times\\n\\nwithin that middle section, so be it.\\n\\nIt's going to help you move through\\n\\nwith better focus and better motivation.\\n\\nAnd what I just described can of course be applied\\n\\nto the longer bouts of effort\\n\\nthat don't occur just during one learning bout,\\n\\nbut perhaps across the week.\\n\\nSo for instance, if you are doing four days a week\\n\\nof language learning or fitness training,\\n\\nso maybe it's a Monday, Wednesday, Friday,\\n\\nSaturday type of schedule,\\n\\nyou may notice that in the middle of the week,\\n\\nthe Wednesday training session tends to be the one\\n\\nthat you're less motivated to do for whatever reason.\\n\\nThere could be any reason at all\\n\\nfor which the motivation is lower in the middle of the week.\\n\\nIt doesn't matter.\\n\\nWell, in that case, you would want to first acknowledge\\n\\nthe presence of the middle problem.\\n\\nSo you would want to acknowledge\\n\\nthat that Wednesday training bout is prone\\n\\nto the middle problem because it is indeed\\n\\nthe middle problem.\\n\\nIt's in the middle of the Monday\\n\\nand the Friday training bouts.\\n\\nSo then you would want to approach it\\n\\nwith the understanding that it's going to be there\\n\\nand that you are going to need tools and protocols\\n\\nthat will allow you to overcome it\\n\\nby for instance, taking that one or two hour session\\n\\non Wednesdays and putting a bit more time\\n\\ntoward a visual target protocol at the beginning\\n\\nto increase your focus, a bit more visualizing failure\\n\\nif you are feeling A motivated,\\n\\nthat means not motivated in nerd speak,\\n\\nA motivated toward doing that Wednesday session.\\n\\nAnd you would want to break up that Wednesday session\\n\\ninto smaller chunks.\\n\\nSo instead of looking at that two hour session,\\n\\nyou might break it up into a series of 15 minutes,\\n\\nsmaller learning bouts done consecutively back to back.\\n\\nAnd then in doing so,\\n\\nyou have essentially taken that Wednesday session\\n\\nand I'll bet that it becomes at least among\\n\\nyour most motivated sessions.\\n\\nSo the middle problem exists, it's important to acknowledge\\n\\nand there are tools to overcome the middle problem\\n\\non any time scale.\\n\\nYou simply have to chunk up the middle\\n\\nand approach things with deliberate increased vigor.\\n\\nJust as you would, if you're running\\n\\nand there's always a tough hill,\\n\\nyou have to really sort of gear up for attacking that hill\\n\\nand then to do that repeatedly in those smaller chunks\\n\\nuntil you've completed that session.\\n\\nSo today I've been talking about how to approach\\n\\ngoal setting and pursuit at and in and around\\n\\nthe specific times that one is engaging\\n\\nin goal setting and pursuit,\\n\\nthe writing down of goals, defining of goals, the timing,\\n\\nand then the actual training sessions\\n\\nor the practice sessions toward achieving that goal.\\n\\nWhat I haven't talked about is how to show up\\n\\nto all of that in the best possible state of mind\\n\\nand body in order to achieve the best possible results.\\n\\nAnd of course, there are numerous things that we need to do\\n\\nin order to quote unquote show up at our best\\n\\nwhere we would stand the best possibility\\n\\nof performing our best and learning the best\\n\\nin those learning bouts.\\n\\nThings like getting adequate sleep,\\n\\ngetting sunlight in our eyes early in the day,\\n\\nadequate and proper nutrition, social connection,\\n\\nand so on.\\n\\nWe talked about all of that in previous podcast episodes,\\n\\nso I'm not going to talk about those again now,\\n\\nbut it is important to recognize that the backdrop\\n\\nof our lives, how well we've slept,\\n\\nwhat's going on in our personal lives\\n\\nwill all impact things like motivation\\n\\nand frankly, our ability to even identify what's important\\n\\nbecause if we're dealing with a health crisis\\n\\nor someone close to us is dealing with a health crisis,\\n\\nwe tend to have our attention diverted toward that.\\n\\nBut I do want to acknowledge all of that\\n\\nbecause it is critically important in defining\\n\\nhow you're going to show up to these endeavors\\n\\nand for that matter, all endeavors.\\n\\nNow, with that said, there are a few things that you can do\\n\\nin order to try and optimize your ability to focus\\n\\nand your level of motivation during your goal pursuits.\\n\\nAnd there are some really interesting data and protocols\\n\\nthat I haven't talked so much about on this podcast ever\\n\\nthat are relevant to today's discussion.\\n\\nAnd this relates to our so-called\\n\\ncircadian rhythms in attention.\\n\\nWe have robust rhythms in our ability to focus\\n\\nand our level of motivation that vary across the 24 hour,\\n\\nAKA circadian cycle with a regular rhythmicity\\n\\nthat is independent of how badly we want a goal\\n\\nor how afraid we are of failure, right?\\n\\nAll the stuff about motivation and fear of failure\\n\\nand desire, et cetera, all of that is still true,\\n\\nbut we all have a naturally occurring rhythm\\n\\nof rise and fall and return to rise and fall\\n\\nof our levels of attention and motivation.\\n\\nAnd this is something that's been described beautifully\\n\\nin the scientific literature.\\n\\nIn fact, I'll provide a link to what I consider\\n\\na really nice review on this topic.\\n\\nThis is a review that was published by Pablo Valdez\\n\\nin the Yale journal, biology and medicine in 2019\\n\\nentitled circadian rhythms in attention.\\n\\nAnd there's a lot of information within this review,\\n\\nbut we can distill out a couple of useful gems from it.\\n\\nSo if you are somebody who is embarking\\n\\non the pursuit of a goal, which is particularly hard,\\n\\nthat's going to require a really high level\\n\\nof motivation and focus,\\n\\nknow that there are three times during the day\\n\\nwhen you stand to have the greatest level\\n\\nof focus and attention.\\n\\nAnd of course, this will vary depending on\\n\\nwhen you went to sleep at night and when you wake up,\\n\\nthere's natural variation in circadian rhythms,\\n\\nbut it's worth knowing that most people find\\n\\nthat their level of attention and motivation\\n\\nis going to be highest 30 minutes,\\n\\nthree hours and 11 hours after waking up, okay?\\n\\nSo 30 minutes, three hours and 11 hours after waking up.\\n\\nAnd this relates to a number\\n\\nof important biological principles related\\n\\nto circadian shifts in body temperature,\\n\\nwhich are also related to circadian shifts.\\n\\nThat means changes around the 24 hour cycle\\n\\nin the release of particular neurochemicals.\\n\\nSo the amount of dopamine available to be released\\n\\nby any sort of goal, pursuit or reward,\\n\\nthe amount of serotonin available,\\n\\nlots of neurochemistry in there, lots of neural circuitry,\\n\\nbut these heightened levels of focus and motivation\\n\\nthat just occur naturally,\\n\\nregardless of what goal one is trying to pursue.\\n\\nIn fact, regardless of whether or not\\n\\nyou're trying to pursue any goal,\\n\\n30 minutes, three hours and 11 hours after waking,\\n\\nyour focus and motivation are going to be their greatest\\n\\nrelative to other times in that 24 hour cycle.\\n\\nNow, as I tell you this,\\n\\nI can imagine that some of you are thinking,\\n\\ngreat, I'm going to schedule one bout of goal pursuits\\n\\nthree hours after waking and another one\\n\\n11 hours after waking.\\n\\nGreat, if you can do that and that fits with your work\\n\\nand other demands of life, your relationships, et cetera,\\n\\nterrific.\\n\\nHowever, I don't want this 30 minute, three hour\\n\\nand 11 hour protocol to be considered a rule.\\n\\nAnd here's why.\\n\\nMost people don't have a tremendous degree of control\\n\\nover their schedule, things like work and family\\n\\nand other demands constrain them\\n\\nin terms of when they can get the work in.\\n\\nAnd while I do think it's extremely valuable\\n\\nto schedule the specific time\\n\\nor roughly the specific time,\\n\\neven though that's an oxymoron,\\n\\nmeaning a period of time during the day,\\n\\nsay before 9 a.m. or between nine and noon\\n\\nthat you are going to carry out your goal pursuit endeavors.\\n\\nI've talked about this in previous podcasts.\\n\\nSome people do very well by scheduling an exact time\\n\\nfrom noon to two, I'm writing.\\n\\nOther people like myself do a little better\\n\\nif I set a constraint, but it's a little bit broader,\\n\\nsuch as I'm going to exercise before 9 a.m.\\n\\nThat could be any time before 9 a.m.\\n\\nOr I'm going to engage in language learning\\n\\nsometime between say 6 p.m. and 9 p.m.\\n\\nas opposed to setting a specific time.\\n\\nThat's just what works best for me.\\n\\nPeople vary in terms of whether or not they respond best\\n\\nto setting a specific time or a time block\\n\\nand setting up these kinds of barriers\\n\\nafter which you are essentially telling yourself\\n\\nyou won't do it, but, and this is a very important but,\\n\\nit is most important that you actually engage\\n\\nin the goal pursuit.\\n\\nAnd I experienced this recently.\\n\\nI'm trying to run more these days.\\n\\nI still enjoy doing resistance training.\\n\\nI still run three days a week,\\n\\nbut I'm trying to run a little bit longer\\n\\nas opposed to just doing the one long run per week\\n\\nand then two shorter runs later in the week.\\n\\nI've talked about this\\n\\nin my optimal fitness protocol episode.\\n\\nIf you want to check that out or check out the PDF\\n\\nwhere it's all distilled down to one or two pages,\\n\\nif you like, but in any event,\\n\\nthese days I'm trying to extend the amount\\n\\nof time that I'm running.\\n\\nI'm just enjoying that.\\n\\nIt's kind of a throwback for me\\n\\nto when I ran across country as a senior in high school.\\n\\nAnd this was the time of year\\n\\nwhen I would start getting ready for the fall season.\\n\\nSo I'm enjoying running more.\\n\\nAnd just this last week,\\n\\nI had the experience of having a very full Sunday.\\n\\nAnd that's usually the day when I run in the morning\\n\\nor hike during the middle of the day.\\n\\nAnd I simply did not get around to it\\n\\nbecause I had a lot of other important things to do.\\n\\nAnd what I found was 9 p.m. rolled around,\\n\\n10 p.m. rolled around.\\n\\nAnd I started thinking, I wish I had gone running.\\n\\nMy Monday was going to be busy.\\n\\nSo what did I do?\\n\\nI laced up my shoes and I went for a run at 10 p.m.\\n\\nSomething I haven't done since college\\n\\nor maybe even high school.\\n\\nAnd I ended up running for 90 minutes\\n\\nfrom 10 p.m. until 1130 p.m.\\n\\nDefinitely not the optimal time for me to go running.\\n\\nIn fact, I was thinking,\\n\\noh, this might disrupt my sleep.\\n\\nBut in fact, it didn't.\\n\\nI came back, I showered, had a little bit of food,\\n\\nwhich normally I don't eat that late.\\n\\nAnd I slept like a baby.\\n\\nAnd I felt great the next day waking up at my normal time,\\n\\nwhich cues me to another important scientific fact\\n\\nthat relates to protocol and protocol flexibility,\\n\\nwhich is something that I gleaned from a colleague of mine\\n\\nat Stanford School of Medicine\\n\\nwho works in the sleep laboratory.\\n\\nAnd I intend to have him as a guest on this podcast,\\n\\nwhich is that much of our subjective feelings\\n\\nof energy and wellbeing during the day\\n\\nhave to do not just with how well\\n\\nand how much we slept the night before,\\n\\nbut how positively we view our previous day's experiences\\n\\nand how positively we view our next day\\n\\nand in fact, that same day pursuits and experiences.\\n\\nSo in other words, how we feel\\n\\nabout our previous day performance\\n\\nand how we feel about what we're about to embark on\\n\\nduring our day can increase our energy.\\n\\nAnd that might seem obvious to a number of you,\\n\\nbut these days, as I and many others out there\\n\\nare talking so much about the importance of sleep,\\n\\nwhich is of course essential,\\n\\nyou do want to get great sleep\\n\\nas many nights of your life as you possibly can.\\n\\nAnd if you don't sleep much for a given night,\\n\\nhopefully it's for reasons that you enjoy\\n\\nand positive things like a party or a wedding\\n\\nor use your imagination.\\n\\nBut it's also the case that when we successfully\\n\\ncomplete something that we told ourselves\\n\\nthat we are going to do, we feel great about it.\\n\\nAnd that if it means that we sleep a little bit less\\n\\nor that we have to do our practice bout,\\n\\nat 3 p.m. or 2 p.m., a time of day\\n\\nwhen we're really ordinarily in the trough of attention\\n\\nand we have to use 20 different tools\\n\\nor one tool 20 different times\\n\\nin order to get through that bout of learning,\\n\\nthe fact that we complete it leaves us\\n\\nwith a feeling of accomplishment.\\n\\nAnd I'm certain, although I don't know exactly which,\\n\\nthat there are neurochemicals and hormones\\n\\nthat reflect that.\\n\\nIt's almost with certainty going to involve dopamine\\n\\nand other neurochemicals.\\n\\nBut the point is not to get reductionist about it.\\n\\nThe point is that, yes, heightened attention and focus\\n\\noccur naturally 30 minutes, three hours,\\n\\nand 11 hours after waking.\\n\\nBut the really important thing\\n\\nabout all of this goal setting and pursuit\\n\\nis to do it, to get it done, to set the goal,\\n\\nto do it specifically, make it quantifiable\\n\\nwhen you're going to do it, make it about verb states,\\n\\nand then simply do it.\\n\\nThank you for joining me for today's discussion\\n\\nall about science-based protocols\\n\\nfor how to set and pursue your goals.\\n\\nIf you're learning

       "[Document(page_content=\"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.\\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.\\nToday, we are discussing music and your brain.\\nHowever, this episode could have just as easily been entitled, music is your brain, or your brain is music.\\nAnd that's because music, believe it or not, is a neurological phenomenon.\\nMost of us think of music as something that happens outside of us, the sounds we hear, the lyrics we hear, their meaning, how they anchor us to pieces of our history, both emotional or social.\\nIt turns out that when we listen to music, it activates nearly every piece of our brain.\\nMoreover, when we listen to music, it activates our brain in ways that our brain itself, and indeed our body as well, help to create that music at the level of so-called neuro-ensemble, that is the firing of neurons.\\nIn other words, when we listen to music, our brain and our body become part of the instrument that contributes to our perception of that music.\\nToday, I'm going to make clear how all of that happens.\\nWe will also discuss how music can be leveraged towards shifting our brain states and our bodily states.\\nFor instance, what sorts of music to listen to in order to make ourselves happy.\\nYes, studies have been done on that, as well as how long to listen to music in order to shift our mood or our overall bodily state, including how to process feelings of sadness.\\nMany of you are probably familiar with particular songs that anchor us to particular times in our history or people in our history.\\nAnd there's an age-old question really as to whether or not listening to sad music can help us process our feelings of sadness or whether or not they drive us further down the spiral of sadness and despair.\\nAnd indeed studies have explored this as well.\\nSo today I will explain how music, indeed how different types of music activate different neural circuits in your brain to create different brain and bodily states, how we can leverage music toward things like emotional processing, shifting our emotions, as well as to enhance learning and memory.\\nAnd we will also talk about the use of music to enhance brain plasticity, that is your brain's ability to change in response to experience, not just in response to that music, but rather using music as a tool to expand our capacity for neuroplasticity, giving us the ability to learn far more in other contexts and areas of life.\\nI confess that in researching this episode, I found myself continually delighted as to, first of all, how impressive the science of the study of music in the brain is.\\nAnd secondly, how fundamental music is to all of our lives.\\nAnd this is true whether or not you're somebody who listens to music often, or you're somebody that really prefers silence.\\nIndeed, we will talk about whether or not it's better to listen to music or remain in silence when you perform certain kinds of work.\\nIt turns out that there's a very clear answer to that.\\nIf you want a little bit of a hint, it is best to listen to music in between bouts of work or during brief rest periods, as opposed to listening to music while you work.\\nAnd for those of you that listen to music while you work and thoroughly enjoy listening to music while you work, we will also discuss what that means about your brain in particular, because it's likely that it got wired up that way at a particular phase of development.\\nAnd each and all of you can learn today how to best leverage music toward productivity, but perhaps equally important how to leverage music for enrichment and enjoyment of life.\\nI'm pleased to announce that we will be hosting three live events in Australia.\\nAll three events will cover science and science related tools for mental health, physical health, and performance.\\nThere will also be a live question and answer session.\\nThe first live event will take place on February 10th in Melbourne at the Plenary Theater.\\nThe second live event will take place on February 17th in Sydney at the Sydney Opera House.\\nAnd the third event will take place on February 23rd in Brisbane at the Great Hall.\\nTo access tickets to any of these events, simply go to hubermanlab.com slash tour and use the code Huberman.\\nI hope to see you there.\\nAnd last but certainly not least, thank you for your interest in science.\\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.\\nIt is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public.\\nIn keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.\\nOur first sponsor is 8 Sleep.\\n8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.\\nI've spoken many times before on this podcast about the fact that sleep, that is getting enough quality sleep each night, is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance.\\nOne of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is to make sure that your body temperature drops by about one to three degrees at the beginning of the night.\\nIndeed, that is how your body falls and stays deeply asleep.\\nAs well, in order to wake up in the morning feeling refreshed, your bodily temperature needs to increase by about one to three degrees.\\n8 Sleep mattress covers make it extremely easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment, allowing you to fall and stay deeply asleep throughout the night and to wake up feeling refreshed.\\nI started sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover well over two years ago, and it has completely transformed my sleep.\\nIt's allowed me to fall asleep more quickly.\\nIt's allowed me to sleep more deeply throughout the night.\\nAnd if I happen to wake up during the middle of the night, something that's perfectly normal to do once or even twice, I fall back asleep far more quickly and I wake up feeling refreshed.\\nAs a consequence, my mood focus and alertness throughout the day is greatly elevated as compared to prior to sleeping on my 8 Sleep mattress cover.\\nIf you'd like to try an 8 Sleep mattress cover, you can go to 8sleep.com slash Huberman to save $150 off their Pod 3 cover.\\n8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK, select countries in the EU and Australia.\\nAgain, that's

of the visual system, and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly in different environments.\\nRoca understands the biology of the visual system and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses so that you always see with crystal clarity.\\nOriginally, their glasses were designed for performance, that is for running and cycling and for sport.\\nAnd indeed, they can still be used for performance.\\nThey won't slip off your face if you get sweaty, they're extremely lightweight.\\nBut I should mention that Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses come in some of the aesthetics more typically associated with performance glasses, like those cyborg style glasses, but they also have a number of styles that you would be perfectly comfortable wearing out to dinner or to work.\\nI wear readers at night or when I drive, and I wear sunglasses during the day if I happen to be driving into bright light or outside, and it's just overwhelmingly bright.\\nI do not wear sunglasses when I do my morning sunlight viewing to set my circadian rhythm, and I suggest that you do the same.\\nIf you'd like to try

about language, I could describe to you a glass, I could describe to you an apple, I could describe to you a story, I could describe to you a face, I could describe to you any number of different things, and you could do the same for me.\\nLanguage is essentially infinite in the number of things that it can explain, and the ways that it can explain it.\\nAnd yet, if you think about music, music, provided there are no lyrics in that music, can't explain how a glass is shaped.\\nIt can't even tell you that there's a glass present in the room or on a table.\\nIt can't tell you what a face looks like.\\nIt can't tell you what that person who owns that face did or is doing.\\nSo in some ways, you might think, wow, music is fairly diminished in terms of its qualitative depth compared to language.\\nAnd yet, if you take a step back and think about what music can do, it's astonishing and it actually overwhelms what language can do.\\nWhat can music do? Well, even in the absence of any lyrics, any words put to music, music can describe an emotion.\\nIn fact, music can describe numerous types of emotions, and it can do it with a lot of nuance.\\nSo not just displaying for us happy or sad, but rather different degrees of happiness, different degrees of sadness.\\nMusic can be used to convey a sense of longing, a sense of nostalgia, a sense of delight, a sense of awe, and on and on.\\nSo whereas music can't describe nouns very well, it can beautifully describe emotions.\\nAnd not only can music describe emotions with a tremendous degree of nuance, music can evoke emotions with a tremendous degree of nuance.\\nNow, this is spectacular, and it's not only spectacular, it is important, because as we move through today's episode, you'll soon come to realize that it's very likely, and indeed, we have a lot of scientific evidence to support the fact that music evolved prior to spoken language.\\nMoreover, it's very likely that singing evolved prior to spoken language, and that music, singing, and dance together evolved prior to language.\\nMaking music as well as singing and dance, but really just music even on its own in the absence of any lyrics or any bodily movement as the fundamental form of human communication.\\nIndeed, music can evoke empathy.\\nAgain, we're talking about music in the absence of any lyrics.\\nAnd when I say music can evoke empathy, I'm not talking about the sort of empathy where you look at somebody and nod and understand so-called cognitive empathy, which is important, by the way, in relational dynamics, or emotional empathy, where you're actually feeling what the other person is feeling, but of course, you never really know what somebody else is feeling, how could you? You can only have a sense of what they might be feeling, and you have a sense of what you're feeling, but let's be honest, as one of our prior guests on the Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Karl Deisseroth, so aptly noted, rarely do we ever understand how anyone else truly feels, because indeed, rarely do we ever understand how we ourselves truly feel.\\nAnd certainly with language, it's very hard to explain our feelings with words in a way that can convey the way that we feel with the kind of nuance that represents our own reality.\\nEven in a state of extreme happiness or extreme sadness, words fall short of explaining how we feel inside.\\nAnd yet, as I mentioned earlier, music not only can describe emotions, it can evoke emotions within us.\\nAnd in doing so, it can evoke emotions that give us a sense of empathy for the person playing the music, or simply for others in the world, and music can do that so powerfully because not only does music come in through our ears, and we'll talk about the process of how sound is converted into what we perceive as music in a little bit, because indeed, it comes in through our ears, and we can hear that music, of course, but the nerve cells, the neurons in your brain, as well as the nerve cells in your body, can become activated by music in a way that the firing of those neurons, literally the frequency of those neural impulses comes to match the frequency of the sounds that you're hearing in your outside environment.\\nIn other words, when you listen to music, not only is that music coming into your body through your sense organs, your hearing, but your body itself is an instrument playing that music from within.\\nSo for instance, if you listen to a piece of music that has a lightness to it, that evokes a sense in you of the turning of the seasons from winter to spring, something that's common in certain classical music, but other forms of music as well.\\nWhen you hear that music, indeed, it's coming in through your ears, but also the firing of the neurons in your brain and body responding to those particular frequencies of sound is such that your body itself is an instrument playing that sense of the turning of the seasons from winter to spring within you, which is why your body starts to feel lifted in some cases, or it starts to feel a lightness in some cases, and an entire set of emotions starts to be recruited that at least for you resemble the turning of the seasons from winter to spring.\\nNow that may sound rather complex, but we're going to break that process down into its component parts.\\nBut what I essentially just said is that when you listen to music, not only are you hearing that music, but your body, that is your neurons, and indeed your hormones as well, things like oxytocin and some other hormones in your brain and body that we'll discuss are contributing to a symphony of emotion from within your body and brain.\\nOkay, so while music can't explain objects, it can't describe them, it can explain in a very nuanced ways, emotions, and it can evoke emotions within us.\\nNow, if that's not amazing enough, music can not only describe and evoke emotions, it can also imply intent.\\nThink for instance about drumming that you would hear off in the distance, and we're not talking about rat-tat-tat-tat-tat, rat-tat-tat-tat.\\nWe're talking drumming of this sort, doom, doom, doom.\\nAnd perhaps the cadence of that drumming changes such that as it's approaching, it gets more and more frequent, doom, doom, doom.\\nWhat is the intent being implied? Well, we know from numerous studies, and you know from numerous movies that you've seen and heard that that sort of low-frequency drumming of increasing cadence as it approaches is implying the intent of aggression or war, or at least is implying that something serious is going to happen.\\nNow contrast that with a different frequency of sound played at a higher cadence.\\nDa-da-da-dum, da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-dum.\\nNow, the second set of tones, da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-dum, are far less clear in terms of what they mean, what their intent is.\\nBut if we contrast them with, let's just call them what they're typically called, the war drums or the drums that convey a sense of aggressive intent, doom, doom, doom.\\nWhat we create then is a juxtaposition of two different emotional states in you perhaps, or maybe you don't respond to those with any robust emotional shift, but we are conveying two separate or distinct sets of intent.\\nNow, of course, spoken language can convey intent.\\nI could say, for instance, you know, I'm going to help you.\\nHow can I help you today? Or I could say, I'm going to hurt you, right? Of course, with spoken language, you could do that, and you could change the intonation of that language, you could change the frequency.\\nSo if I were to say, I'm going to hurt you, it's very different than if I say, I'm going to hurt you.\\nOkay, or if I put it as a question, I'm going to hurt you.\\nOkay, so with language, of course, there's also the opportunity for a lot of nuance, depending on where the inflections, where the accents are on a particular phrase, even a particular word.\\nBut with music, as you recall, when we convey a sense of intent, we are also conveying that sense of intent through the body of the listener, not just bringing it in through their ears.\\nAnd so when we do that, what we do is we start to recruit a huge number of neural circuits that are involved, not just in understanding or a sense of empathy for an emotion, but rather that can recruit movement or what we call pre-motor circuits in the body.\\nPre-motor circuits are the neurons that start to fire before a particular pattern of action is generated.\\nAnd so when we hear music that conveys emotion, that evokes emotion, and especially when we hear music that conveys a sense of intent from the outside, we too start to feel as if we need to move or respond to that music in a particular way.\\nNow, what I just described to you is not something that's learned.\\nIn fact, it is innate.\\nHow do we know that? Well, there are some beautiful studies that have explored how babies respond to music.\\nIndeed, how babies respond to specific types of music, specific frequencies of sound, spacing between particular notes, and on and on.\\nIt's been demonstrated, for instance, that babies as young as three months old respond to music very differently than they respond to just other forms of sound scrambled in time.\\nNow, of course, babies that are three months old aren't speaking, so you could ask them, does that sound like music? How does it make you feel, et cetera? They're not going to answer, at least not with any coherence because they don't have spoken language yet.\\nBut despite their absence of language, we know that babies as young as three months old respond to music because they do so with rhythmic movements of their bodily limbs and actually their torso as well.\\nNow, a little bit later, we will touch on this issue of what types of music evoke movement of the torso versus movement of the limbs versus movement of the torso and limbs.\\nNo, I'm not going to dance for you during this podcast.\\nHowever, there's a really interesting story there that relates to how primitive or evolved the motor neurons, the neurons that actually move the musculature are and how primitive or evolved the music that one listens to is.\\nBut just to give you a sense of where that's headed, in this study where they examined the responses of very young babies to music, what they found is that certain frequencies of sound evoked movements in those babies that were rhythmic, where it was mostly their torso moving back and forth and maybe their head a little bit.\\nWhereas other patterns of sound, different frequencies in different arrangements, evoked movement of their limbs more than their torso and still other patterns of sounds evoked movement of their torso, limbs and head.\\nIn other words, babies dancing.\\nAnd if you've ever been to a wedding or a party or been out dancing, you will see people who include more torso versus limb versus limb and torso movement when they dance.\\nAnd yes, of course, some of this relates to proficiency in dancing, comfort on the dance floor, et cetera.\\nBut there are some universal rules out there about how certain frequencies and patterns of sound, AKA music, evokes different types of bodily movements.\\nSo starting from a very young age, prior to any instruction in terms of how to dance or what music is, babies are dancing to music.\\nAnd that highlights an important point that we will return to again and again throughout today's episode, which is that the systems of the brain that respond specifically to movement, not just sound, but specifically to musical sounds are intimately tied to the neural circuits of the body that generate movement.\\nAnd this is especially important to understand when we get into our discussion about music and our sense of motivation.\\nOkay, so the list of incredible things that music can evoke within us by way of how it activates our nervous system and body is starting to grow.\\nWe've talked about how music can convey emotion, how music can evoke emotion and how music can convey a sense of intent, as well now as how music can generate action within us.\\nThis is a pretty spectacular list if you think about it.\\nIn addition, music causes changes within our bodily physiology that extends beyond the nervous system, although it has a relationship to the nervous system.\\nIn particular, there've been a lot of studies that have explored how music changes things like our blood pressure or how fast our heart is beating, our so-called resting heart rate.\\nAnd here we've made some important discoveries in recent years.\\nAnd when I say we, I don't mean my laboratory.\\nI mean, laboratories that focus on the relationship between music and our bodily physiology.\\nBecause we've long known that music can change various health metrics.\\nThere's some really nice studies, and I'll link to one or two of the meta-analyses of these studies in the show note captions that have showed that if people listen to anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes of music per day, and by the way, the selection of music in these studies ranged everything from rock and roll to classical music, to country music.\\nTypically, these studies would ask subjects what their favorite music is.\\nAnd then they would have them listen to that particular genre of music for anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes per day.\\nAnd if you look at the meta-analyses of those studies, what you find is that almost all of them see some sort of significant effect.\\nThat is some statistically significant shift in the bodily physiology of people that deliberately listen to music for 10 to 30 minutes per day.\\nNot while doing anything else, but just listening to that music.\\nThey find, for instance, that their resting heart rate is reduced.\\nIf not during the period in which they're listening to the music, then after the time in which they're listening to the music, they find that their so-called heart rate variability tends to increase.\\nFor those of you that aren't familiar with heart rate variability, having increased heart rate variability is a good thing.\\nAnd that's because heart rate variability reflects the sort of push and pull, or the balance rather, of the activation of the so-called sympathetic nervous system, which is the one sometimes called the fight or flight system, although I don't really like that nomenclature.\\nThe sympathetic nervous system, by the way, is not about emotional sympathy.\\nIt's what drives your heart rate higher.\\nIt tends to put us into activated states where we favor movement and motion and makes us alert.\\nWhereas the parasympathetic aspect of our nervous system is the portion of our autonomic nervous system, sometimes called the rest and digest system.\\nThe parasympathetic nervous system drives states of deeper relaxation, of calm.\\nIn any event, heart rate variability reflects a periodic breaking, a slowing down of heart rate and breathing and other aspects of our neural system function that works alongside with sympathetic activation.\\nThink of sympathetic activation as an accelerator, parasympathetic activation as a break.\\nAnd when heart rate variability is higher, it reflects the fact that our parasympathetic nervous system is periodically engaging.\\nIt's getting activated and slowing our heart rate, slowing our breathing down.\\nMusic seems to have the effect of activating that parasympathetic aspect of our nervous system.\\nAnd so we are pumping the break every once in a while, slowing down our heart rate, slowing down our breathing.\\nIn other words, when people listen to music for a dedicated period of time each day of about 10 to 30 minutes, some studies looked at as much as 60 minutes, but typically 10 to 30 minutes, what one finds is that heart rate variability increases, not just during the period when they're listening to the music, this is very important, but also heart rate variability is increased around the clock in those subjects, even during sleep.\\nMaking listening to 10 to 30 minutes of your favorite music each day, not just what I would think to be a enjoyable protocol, if you could even call it a protocol, it's so enjoyable to listen to your favorite music that it feels almost inappropriate to call it a protocol because protocol sounds kind of rigid like you're imposing that on yourself.\\nBut if you need an excuse to listen to your favorite music for 10 to 30, maybe 60 minutes per day and just attending to that music, not while doing anything else, which is what these studies had subjects do, well, indeed that's been shown to increase heart rate variability around the clock, which we know is beneficial for your mental and physical health more generally.\\nOkay, so there are dozens, if not hundreds of studies that have explored how music impacts our physiology.\\nAnd as I just mentioned, it seems that if we listen to music that we like for 10 to 30, maybe 60 minutes a day, our physiology, certain health metrics, heart rate variability in particular improve.\\nNow, in light of the positive effects of listening to music on one's health, there's a recent meta-analysis that I found particularly interesting.\\nThe title of this meta-analysis is effects of music on the cardiovascular system.\\nAnd it was published in Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine.\\nNow from the title of this paper, effects of music on the cardiovascular system, you might think that it's just yet another meta-analysis exploring how music impacts heart rate variability and things of that sort.\\nBut what's interesting about this study is that it identifies that the way in which listening to one's favorite music positively impacts the cardiovascular system and other aspects of our physiology is very likely not through direct changes on our heart rate simply by listening to music, but rather through changes in our breathing.\\nAnd this is true even if people were not singing along with the music, by the way.\\nNow, the relationship between breathing and heart rate is something that I've touched on before, but if you haven't heard me discuss this, I'm just going to briefly tell you the relationship in two or three sentences, and then I'll explain the mechanism also in about two to three sentences.\\nSo if you have a background in biology or even if you don't, this will all be very simple and very clear.\\nWhen you deliberately inhale with a lot of vigor or you deliberately make your inhale longer than you naturally would.\\nSo for instance, if I breathe in very vigorously through my nose, something very specific happens to your heart rate.\\nIt increases.\\nWhereas when you deliberately exhale, meaning when you exhale and deliberately make that exhale longer, or you deliberately add vigor to that exhale, or even a shorter, deliberate, more vigorous exhale, you slow down your heart rate.\\nAnd that's because of a phenomenon called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, which because it includes the word arrhythmia, sounds like a bad thing, but it's actually a wonderful thing.\\nIt has to do with the relationship between a particular muscle in your body called the diaphragm, which when you inhale, our lungs fill with air, our diaphragm moves down, and our heart therefore has a little bit more space.\\nIt actually gets bigger, temporarily bigger, but bigger.\\nAnd when it does that, whatever volume of blood is in the heart is now moving through a larger space.\\nSo it's the same amount of blood moving through a larger space.\\nAnd the nervous system registers that as the blood moving more slowly through that temporarily enlarged heart.\\nAnd as a consequence, there's a signal sent through various stations of the nervous system to the heart to speed the heart up.\\nIn other words, just as I said before, when we inhale, our heart rate speeds up.\\nConversely, when we exhale, our lungs empty out some air, our diaphragm moves up.\\nAnd as a consequence of that, there's less space for the heart.\\nAnd so our heart temporarily becomes smaller.\\nAnd when that happens, the volume of blood within that smaller heart moves more quickly.\\nAnd that's detected by the nervous system, which then triggers a neural signal from the parasympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system, which is just fancy nerd speak for a neural signal is sent to your heart every time you exhale to slow your heart down.\\nSo the well-established effects of listening to your favorite music, increasing your heart rate variability is not a direct interaction between the sounds coming in through your ears and changes in your heart rate while you're listening to the music.\\nThat's actually what I would have thought happened, but this more recent meta-analysis pulls apart the variables in these different studies.\\nIt really illustrates that when we are listening to music, we are subconsciously, most of the time subconsciously, changing our patterns of breathing.\\nWe are inhaling in anticipation of certain things happening in the music.\\nWe're exhaling when we feel a relief of tension.\\nWe get excited.\\nWe may get sad.\\nWe may get happy.\\nWe may even just be listening to music that we don't think is impacting our physiology at such a core level, but indeed it is.\\nMusic is able to route into our nervous system at levels below our conscious awareness and literally turn the various knobs, if you will, of our cardiovascular system, of our breathing apparatus, the diaphragm, the lungs.\\nIt can evoke respiratory sinus arrhythmia, which again, sounds like a terrible thing, but is actually the reflection of a healthy nervous system in heart.\\nAnd in doing so, yes, it increases heart rate variability, something that is beneficial to all of us, but it's doing so by changing our patterns of breathing.\\nSo if you've ever wondered why music can change how you feel so robustly, well, it's doing that at a deep foundational level of your nervous system.\\nIndeed, at the levels of your nervous system that typically are not in your conscious awareness, because I have to imagine that most of you are probably not listening to music and thinking, oh, here comes that one chorus or here comes that one melody and this is where I always exhale or this is where I always hold my breath, this sort of thing.\\nNo, most people are just listening to music.\\nIt's coming in through their ears.\\nThey're experiencing some bodily sensations.\\nMaybe they're moving their torso, arms, maybe arms and torso.\\nMaybe you're not moving at all, no dancing.\\nMaybe just listening within your head or maybe it's just dropped into the background below your conscious awareness at all.\\nAnd yet that music is communicating emotion.\\nIt's evoking emotion.\\nIt's communicating intent.\\nIt's activating those pre-motor circuits that would have you move if it could.\\nAnd we'll talk about dance a little bit later.\\nBut even if you're not dancing, even if you're not swaying the tiniest bit, your patterns of breathing are changing and through respiratory sinus arrhythmia, your heart rate is changing and through changes in your heart rate, your heart rate variability is increasing.\\nSo if ever you wanted a tool or protocol that was easy to use, but could positively impact your mental and physical health, well, listening to your favorite music for 10 to 30, maybe 60 minutes, maybe more per day is that protocol.\\nAs many of you know, I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012.\\nSo I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.\\nAG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that's designed to meet all of your foundational nutrition needs.\\nNow, of course, I try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day, but oftentimes I simply can't get enough servings.\\nBut with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals and the probiotics that I need and it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress.\\nSimply put, I always feel better when I take AG1.\\nI have more focus and energy and I sleep better and it also happens to taste great.\\nFor all these reasons, whenever I'm asked, if you could take just one supplement, what would it be? I answer AG1.\\nIf you'd like to try AG1, go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman to claim a special offer.\\nThey'll give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.\\nAgain, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman.\\nSo hopefully it's becoming clear just how absolutely powerful music is at evoking different physiological responses within you, that is within your brain and body.\\nBut there's an additional one that I find particularly interesting because it addresses and indeed answers one of the most common questions that I receive all the time, which is how can I get more motivated? Not how I, Andrew can get more motivated, although of course I asked myself that question from time to time.\\nAlthough admittedly, most of the time I'm wondering how I'm just going to get everything that I need to get done, done.\\nBut I often get the question, how can I feel more motivated? Or what can I do to sustain my motivation over time? And we hear a lot of different strategies about how to do that.\\nWe hear about the quote unquote, just do it strategy, the incredible slogan that Nike created and that persists to this day has become commonplace in culture.\\nAnd indeed the just do it form of advice can be a good one, but for a lot of people, just hearing just do it or telling themselves just do it is not something that can evoke action in them.\\nOther people will listen to motivational speeches, they'll look at motivational videos, they'll read motivational books, they may even hire coaches.\\nIn other words, people invest a ton of time, energy and money into trying to be more motivated.\\nAnd indeed a number of episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast have focused on the relationship between say motivation drive and the neuromodulator dopamine.\\nWe have several episodes about that as well as a toolkit, all of which are available at zero cost at hubermanlab.com.\\nYou can access those easily by putting motivation into the search function at hubermanlab.com.\\nAll of that will come up timestamped, et cetera.\\nBut perhaps surprisingly today's conversation about music offers us a particularly potent tool to increase motivation.\\nAnd that's because one of the fundamental properties of listening to music is that it evokes activation of these pre-motor and motor circuits within our brain and body.\\nThat is the neural circuits whose specific job is to mobilize our body from its current position and state to a new position and state.\\nSo for those of you that listen to music while you work out or prior to when you work out, you are definitely onto something.\\nFor those of you that don't, that's fine too.\\nWhat I'm going to describe now are the specific sets of neural circuits that listening to music activates.\\nAs I mentioned earlier, listening to music activates so many circuits throughout the brain and body that really one can take a step back from the scientific literature on this and say, anytime someone has done a study where human beings listen to music and people record from a particular brain area, believe it or not, even from the olfactory system, from the system in the brain responsible for smell, there seems to be some significant shift in terms of the neural firing there or the release of neural chemicals, which on the one hand might lead you to conclude that listening to music is just sort of a non-specific generalized activator of nervous system function.\\nIt's just kind of like turning all the lights on, but that's not the case.\\nMusic in fact is activating different neural circuits differently in time and space to evoke a whole set of specific reactions in your brain and body, but not the least of which is the propensity for you to move.\\nAnd this is something that you can leverage.\\nAnd indeed I'll describe a protocol by which you can leverage music in order to greatly increase your state of motivation.\\nOkay, so this is the portion of today's episode where we're going to discuss some specific neural circuits, but I want to assure you that if you're a neurobiologist, you can understand this.\\nIf you are not a neurobiologist, in fact, if you took no biology ever in your life, I'm going to make it clear and easy for you to understand.\\nAs I mentioned before, when we hear music, it activates many, many circuits throughout the brain and body.\\nWhen I say circuits, I mean neurons, nerve cells that communicate with one another and sort of chains of reactions.\\nWhen I say respond to one another, what I mean is when neurons are quote unquote activated, they release chemicals.\\nThose chemicals are called neurotransmitters, things like glutamate, GABA.\\nThey're also called neuromodulators, things like dopamine, serotonin.\\nThe names don't really matter for sake of today's discussion, but what those things do is they influence the likelihood that the next neuron will be active or less active.\\nOkay, so neurons speak the language, if you will, of electricity, because that's how they evoke release of these chemicals and chemistry.\\nThey vomit out these chemicals.\\nThose chemicals then bind to little parking spots on the next neuron called receptors, and then the next neuron gets activated electrically and then to the next neuron and next neuron and so on.\\nIt's a chain of electrochemical reactions.\\nOkay, so there's your neuroscience 101 lesson for today.\\nWhen people listen to music, there is heightened activation of the so-called frontal cortex, the area of your brain which is on the surface below your skull, but just behind your forehead more or less.\\nAnd that area of your brain is involved in a lot of different things.\\nIt's involved in understanding context, what sorts of behaviors and thoughts and actions are appropriate for a given environment.\\nBy the way, if any of you have ever been in an environment where everyone was really quiet and you thought, oh my gosh, what's keeping me from just blurting out my name right now or saying something totally inappropriate, your frontal cortex is the one providing the so-called top-down inhibition on that impulse to blurt something inappropriate out.\\nAnd by the way, your thoughts about that impulse are perfectly normal.\\nThey actually reflect a heightened sense of normalcy because it means that your brain is thinking about how it's not going to do that.\\nAnd so therefore you're not going to do that.\\nLikewise, if you are ever at the edge of a high bridge, please stay on the safe side of the railing.\\nBut if you think, oh my goodness, what's keeping me from just jumping off the bridge right now, what's keeping you from doing that is your frontal cortex.\\nIt's suppressing certain actions in a context dependent way in particular actions that are dangerous to you socially, physically, dangerous to others, socially, physically, et cetera.\\nNow, the frontal cortex in order to do that also has an incredible ability to make predictions.\\nSo this is the function of the frontal cortex that I want to focus on for the moment.\\nYour frontal cortex is great at doing the, if this, then that type of analysis.\\nIf I say this, everyone will be offended.\\nOr if I say this, maybe they'll laugh.\\nOr if I don't say this, I'll be safe.\\nIf I do say that, I won't be safe, this kind of thing.\\nFrontal cortex is activated when we listen to music because within music, there are some regularities.\\nSometimes these are described as motifs or melodies or choruses.\\nAgain, this is the entire landscape of discussion that we could have and we will have with an expert guest about how the mathematics of music impacts the electrochemical signaling within the brain and the coding that is the mathematics of brain function, which leads us to predict that certain things because they just happened are likely to happen again or not happen again.\\nBut let's set all that aside for the moment and just state the simple fact, which is that when you listen to music, your frontal cortex increases in activation because it is predicting what you're going to hear next based on what you're currently hearing and what you heard before.\\nNow, I am from the generation that we didn't have iPods when I was a kid.\\nWe did have CDs, we did have tapes, but you had to fast forward or rewind a cassette tape or you had to skip on the CD in order to move about the album in time.\\nNowadays, you can queue up different songs in different order really easily.\\nBut if you are somebody who listens to albums start to finish, or if you're like me and you grew up listening to albums start to finish, maybe occasionally skipping a song, but you will be very familiar with this phenomenon, which is that right as a given song ends, if you're familiar with that album, you already anticipate the start of the next song in your head.\\nAnd that just speaks to the predictive function that the frontal cortex plays.\\nSo if you have a mixtape with a bunch of different songs, sure, you don't expect one song of a given artist to lead into the next.\\nBut if you're somebody who's listened to that mixtape a lot, so you're familiar with what song comes next, or if you're listening to a given album, start to finish and you're very familiar with it, well, then you'll immediately resonate with what I'm saying here, which is that your frontal cortex is always anticipating what sound is likely to come next.\\nAnd this is very important because one of the key things about music and its ability to evoke our sense of surprise or delight through the release of a neuromodulator called dopamine, we'll get to this a bit more later, is because that prediction machinery is thinking, oh, I heard that set of chords a moment ago, I'm going to hear it again.\\nAnd then when it changes up, your brain goes, oh, whoa, hold on, that wasn't what I expected.\\nAnd it sometimes does that with a sense of delight, like, oh, yes.\\nAnd sometimes it hears that and goes, oh, wait, what's this? I don't really like this that much.\\nI like the opener of that song, but I don't really like the rest.\\nI think of that as, you know, there's certain pastries, muffins in particular, where I really like the top, it's got the little crumbs, it's got the berries and stuff, and then you can like get down past the top and then you get to the middle thing, you're like, oh, well, this thing's not that good.\\nOkay, there's certain songs like that for me.\\nSo I always thought of those as muffin songs because the top of the muffin is always the best, whereas a donut is great the whole way through.\\nAnd now I'm going on a tangent because I'm thinking about muffins and donuts.\\nSo I'm going to take us back to music.\\nBut the point is relevant nonetheless, which is that your frontal cortex is making predictions.\\nAnd when those predictions are broken, that's a sense of novelty.\\nAnd when that novelty is something that you like, okay, so it evokes a sense of, yes, I like that.\\nWell, then dopamine is deployed.\\nAnd when that novelty is something you don't like, typically there's a reduction in the amount of dopamine released in a separate set of brain circuits below whatever level of dopamine happened to be there prior, your so-called baseline level of dopamine, okay? So when you listen to music, there's a strong activation of the prediction machinery in your brain.\\nThere's also activation of the circuits in your brain that register novelty.\\nWhat are those circuits? These are things like the ventral tegmental area and the nucleus accumbens.\\nI've talked about these before on the podcast.\\nAgain, you don't need to know those names.\\nThose are the names given to certain brain areas that control the release of dopamine in time according to whatever you happen to be experiencing in that moment, okay? So the mesolimbic reward pathway could perhaps better be called the mesolimbic reinforcement pathway.\\nSo for those of you out there shouting, wait, the mesolimbic pathway does a bunch of other things.\\nIt's not just dopamine.\\nI agree, it's also serotonin.\\nIt's a bunch of other things.\\nBut for today's discussion, we're thinking about the mesolimbic pathway as deploying dopamine, which it does when we hear something novel, meaning not what we predicted and we like what we hear.\\nAnd then there are a bunch of other brain centers and circuits that listening to music activates.\\nI'll just list off a few.\\nSo again, this isn't intended to confuse anybody or add a lot of useless nomenclature.\\nBut since I am a neuroscientist and this is a science and science informed tools podcast, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that we get strong activation of a brain structure.\\nYou actually have two of them, one on each side of the brain called the amygdala.\\nThis is a brain area that's part of a larger set of circuits that's associated with arousal, okay? Meaning becoming more alert, becoming more aware of our surroundings and the particular sensory stimuli that are coming in at a particular time, such as the notes of the music or a particular set of lyrics.\\nAnd music also activates areas of the brain such as the parahippocampal formation, the cortex and the hippocampus itself, brain areas that encode and store memories.\\nAnd this is something that I think everyone will be familiar with.\\nWhen you hear certain songs or even songs that sound like certain songs or even songs that you swear you've never heard before, it can evoke a sense of nostalgia, of longing for something, of missing somebody, of sadness or of delight and happiness and positive memories of somebody or something.\\nIndeed, I think it's fair to say that hearing particular pieces of music, particular songs more than any other experience can activate a whole library of memory and emotions within us.\\nAnd that's because of its ability to activate the parahippocampal regions of the brain, the cortex and the hippocampus itself.\\nAgain, several different brain areas, all which communicate with one another and other areas of the brain in order to encode our memories, our sense of self, our sense of others, our sense of history with those people and on and on.\\nNow, rather than just make this a catalog of different brain areas that music evokes, what I'm trying to do is spell out how music activating these different brain areas is creating different components of what we are familiar with as our experience of music.\\nSo frontal cortex prediction, mesolimbic reward pathway, novelty, amygdala, a sense of emotion and arousal.\\nParahippocampal cortex and cortex and hippocampus, our memories in particular, our emotional memories and our location memories associated with a particular piece of music, right? Haven't you ever heard a song from, let's say a summer camp that you went to when you were a kid and all of a sudden you're remembering the smell of the grasses at that summer camp.\\nYou're remembering how some of the kids were really great and how some of the kids were really obnoxious.\\nYou're remembering some things that you did.\\nYou're remembering your counselors.\\nI mean, there's just a whole landscape of neural information there, life information stored in your head that hearing a particular song that was sung when you were what, eight years old, 10 years old at camp just flips the lid on and it comes geysering out.\\nRemarkable.\\nNow there are two other sets of brain circuits that are activated by music that deserve specific attention and deserve that specific attention now in the context of discussing motivation and music's ability to motivate us in particular ways.\\nAnd those brain circuits are the basal ganglia, okay? So this is a set of circuits within the brain that are associated with action initiation, so-called go circuits and withholding action, so-called no-go circuits.\\nBut basically the basal ganglia are involved in regulating movement and the cerebellum.\\nThe cerebellum is sometimes referred to as the mini brain.\\nIt looks like a little mini brain in the bottom back of the human brain.\\nIn some species, the cerebellum is much larger relative to the rest of the brain, but in humans, it's like this little piece in the back that looks like a little mini brain, like you're carrying a second brain back there.\\nThat's why I call it mini brain, cerebellum.\\nAnd it's involved in a lot of things, but one of its primary functions is to encode rhythmic timing and processing and along with its outputs to some deeper brainstem areas, things like the vestibular and cochlear nuclei.\\nWe'll talk about this, the parabracial nucleus.\\nAgain, you don't need to know these names.\\nIt, meaning the cerebellum along with the basal ganglia creates patterns of activity in our brain that cascade down to particular circuits in our body.\\nSo these are so-called pre-motor circuits and motor circuits that generate the sense that we not only can move, but that we want to move and that we want to move in particular ways.\\nSo if you internalize nothing from the last five minutes or so in which I've been describing how music impacts different neural circuits in the brain, please do take away this important point, which is that when we listen to music, we think of that as an auditory experience, but now you know that it's also an emotional experience.\\nAnd, and this is a very important and, when we listen to music, it is programming a specific set of motor actions that are more likely to occur.\\nPut differently, when we listen to music, we are more likely to move our body and not just dance, not just move our torso, our limbs, or our limbs and torso together in concert with the music, but rather move our body from its current position to another position.\\nAnd this is one of the most important things to understand about music.\\nMusic, despite being an auditory stimulus coming in through our ears, evokes the activation of neural circuits in our brain that creates a sort of inertia.\\nIt creates a propensity for action across our entire body.\\nSo now that you understand that listening to music activates lots of different brain circuits, of course, the circuits that respond to auditory stimuli, so called primary auditory cortex, is powerfully activated by listening to music, but also circuits associated with novelty, anticipation.\\nWe talked about circuits in the brain associated with memory, but also circuits in the brain that are associated with generating movement and not just movement that is in sync with or corresponds to the music that we're listening to, but all forms of movement.\\nBut when we listen to music that has a relatively fast cadence, and we can actually define what that cadence needs to be, and we'll do that in a moment.\\nWhen we do that, so-called premotor circuitry, the circuitry that's going to initiate that kind of inertia or that pressure for movement within the neural circuits that actually evoke movement are all activated.\\nSo for those of you that like to listen to music while you exercise, you're familiar with the fact that listening to great songs with a great beat, with particular lyrics, or that associate you with a particular time or place in your life can be very motivating.\\nBut there are data showing that when people listen to music that's faster than about 140 to 150 beats per minute, that it creates a heightened state of motivation in the body to move.\\nAnd the way that it does that is by way of shifting the balance between those go circuits and no-go circuits of the basal ganglia.\\nThere's some other ways that it does it as well.\\nFor instance, music can evoke the release of certain neurochemicals called the catecholamines.\\nThese include dopamine, but also norepinephrine and epinephrine from centers in the brain and body glands in the body like the adrenal gland that shift the body toward a predisposition of being more likely to move.\\nSo if we want to distill all this out to a simple, actionable takeaway, simply know this.\\nListening to music, relatively faster music, predisposes you to be more motivated to move.\\nAnd that is independent.\\nThis is what I find so cool.\\nIt's independent of whether or not you're familiar with the song, independent of whether or not the lyrics of the song are motivating lyrics.\\nIf they are, that's just going to layer on top of the faster cadence, which is going to predispose you to move.\\nBut what's remarkable is that just listening to that faster cadence music is creating a neuronal resonance, if you will, a pattern of neuronal firing within you that is going to essentially take your, and here I'm using metaphor, is going to put your state of motivation from either back on your heels to being flat-footed, or let's say you're mildly motivated, so I'll call that flat-footed, to being forward center of mass.\\nSo for any of you that are suffering from lack of motivation, in particular to exercise, but believe it or not, also to do cognitive work where you're going to be still and you're going to sit down and you're going to read or learn or practice something, listening to music for 10 to 15 minutes prior to doing that work, prior to doing that exercise is one of the best ways to get motivated in order to engage in that work or engage in that exercise.\\nThat's been demonstrated in the data very conclusively using a variety of different types of music.\\nAnd again, there are multiple mechanisms that converge to create that heightened state of motivation.\\nSome of those mechanisms are neurochemical, like the release of the so-called catecholamine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.\\nSome of them are strictly neural circuit-based, so activation of premotor circuitry, and those are going to combine with neural circuits that are going to narrow your field of vision.\\nThis is a good thing whenever you want to be motivated, they're going to literally constrict your field of vision to more of a tunnel type of vision, as opposed to more panoramic vision, and that I described it as placing you into a forward center of mass.\\nI don't necessarily mean literally a forward center of mass, unless perhaps you're exercising like running, leaning slightly forward.\\nWhat I'm talking about is using music as a way to deliberately shift your state of mind and body from one that is a-motivated, not motivated to more motivated.\\nAnd it's a very simple protocol extracted from the peer-reviewed literature.\\nYou simply find some faster music, hopefully music that you like, it would be even better if it was music that had lyrics that you find motivating, and listening to that for 10 to 15 minutes prior to engaging in whatever that work may be, physical or cognitive.\\nOn the topic of cognitive work, one of the most common questions I get is, what sorts of sounds or music should I listen to in order to increase my state of productivity, motivation, concentration, et cetera? On previous podcasts related to focus and motivation, I touched on the use of so-called binaural beats, which are different frequencies of beats presented to one or the other ear.\\nThis is best accomplished with headphones, and there are a lot of different frequencies of binaural beats that you can get out there.\\nIf you want to get detailed about this, binaural beats also involve the differential between the frequency of beats between the two, presented to the two ears, and then that difference then is heard by higher order processing centers in the brain.\\nIn any event, we don't have to get too technical about it.\\nWe can simply say that, yes, there are some decent peer-reviewed studies demonstrating that when people listen to so-called 40 hertz, it's a particular frequency of sound, 40 hertz binaural beats, that it can enhance concentration and focus.\\nHowever, this is important, there are some recent studies that show that binaural beats sometimes can impede concentration and focus, and thereby can impede cognitive performance on various tasks.\\nHowever, the studies that show that binaural beats can be detrimental to performance on various cognitive tasks did not use 40 hertz binaural beats specifically.\\nSo we are still awaiting more studies on binaural beats.\\nMeanwhile, I'll just restate what I said before, is that there is some evidence that listening to 40 hertz binaural beats can enhance concentration and focus.\\nThere are also data showing that other frequencies of binaural beats might be detrimental to concentration and cognitive performance.\\nAnd previously, I've also discussed studies showing that for instance, if people listen to white noise in the background, you could do this on your computer or speakers in the room or headphones, or so-called brown noise, which is essentially like white noise, all frequencies of sound or most frequencies of sound combined, but with particular frequencies of sounds that are accentuated and others are notched out as it's called, so-called brown noise.\\nRather than understand all of this at a technical level, because I've covered that before in previous podcasts, suffice to say, if you go to YouTube and you just put in white noise background for cognitive focus or brown noise background for cognitive focus, you can just try those if you like during a session in which you're trying to read or learn or do mathematics or music or any kind of cognitive work.\\nIf you don't like them, if they don't work for you, then there's certainly no obligation to use them.\\nLikewise with 40 Hertz binaural beats.\\nAnd for binaural beats, you can also find those as zero cost YouTube scripts.\\nThere are a number of zero cost apps that will allow you to listen to binaural beats.\\nI've used the app Brainwave for some period of time now.\\nTo be honest, I've never done this strict control experiment on myself of listening to the 40 Hertz binaural beats or not listening to 40 Hertz binaural beats doing the equivalent types of tasks.\\nI can be fairly regimented with my work and behavior, but I haven't run a detailed controlled study on myself around this.\\nRather, if I want to heighten my level of focus or rule out distractions, what I will do is I will listen to either white noise or brown noise while I do work, or I will listen to 40 Hertz binaural beats while I do certain types of work.\\nOr sometimes, frankly, I just work in silence.\\nOther times I will listen to classical music in the background.\\nI'm a big fan of listening to classical piano.\\nI particularly like Glenn Gould, the Bach variations.\\nThose are very pleasant to me.\\nBut, and this is really important, in researching this episode about music and the brain, what I discovered was in the controlled studies that have been carried out as to whether or not people perform better on cognitive tasks that require a lot of focus, especially learning tasks, that compared silence in the background to purely instrumental music in the background, to music with lyrics in the background, to one's favorite music with or without lyrics, the data are very clear.\\nIt's very clear that most people, that means statistically, on average, people perform best on cognitive tasks or tasks that require a lot of focus to perform.\\nAgain, these are mental tasks, not physical tasks, when they are doing those tasks in complete silence.\\nSo that was somewhat surprising to me.\\nSecond best conditions are to do those tasks in the presence of instrumental music only.\\nAnd in that case, there was a lot of variation as to whether or not people preferred faster cadence music.\\nSo 140 to 150 beats per minute or faster, or slower music, 60 beats per minute or slower.\\nI'll get back to those specific numbers later because they represent thresholds for inducing different types of emotional states, either happy or sad.\\nBut meanwhile, it's very clear when people work in silence, they perform better than when they work with music instrumentals in the background.\\nAnd they perform even less well when they listen to music with lyrics in the background.\\nWe'll talk about why that is the case in a moment.\\nAnd then people perform especially poorly relative to their performance in silence or any of the other conditions I mentioned when they listen to their favorite music while doing cognitive work.\\nAnd that to me was a bit surprising, especially since I spent a lot of my university years studying while listening to my favorite music in different forms.\\nI'd listen to slower music, then faster music and go back and forth.\\nAnd then sometimes turn it off altogether and work in silence.\\nBut the center of mass of the literature around this issue of whether or not to listen to music while one studies or tries to learn something, the data are pretty clear.\\nThe data show that it's best to study and learn either in silence or with quiet instrumentals in the background.\\nNow, I mentioned before that previous studies compared the effects of working in silence versus working with 40 Hertz binaural beats or white noise or brown noise in the background.\\nAnd in those studies, it was found that the white noise, brown noise and 40 Hertz binaural beats background produced better levels of focus, I should say heightened levels of focus and cognitive performance and learning than working in silence.\\nBut I've not yet seen a study that compared 40 Hertz binaural beats, brown noise, white noise to music directly.\\nPerhaps there's one out there.\\nIf there is, please send it to me.\\nI'd be very curious to learn what the results of those are.\\nNow that might seem like a lot of information, but the takeaways from it are very clear.\\nAnd it's always nice when things are clear, right? It's clear that if we want to focus and learn that working in silence or with white noise or brown noise or 40 Hertz binaural beats is going to be preferable to working while listening to music.\\nBut if you're going to listen to music while you work, that is do cognitive work, then you're going to want to listen to music that is purely instrumental.\\nAnd ideally the music would be somewhat faster than 140 to 150 beats per minute.\\nNow, I do not expect you to go and measure the frequency of beats per minute in the music that you listen to.\\nAnd of course the beats per minute are going to change, right? That's an average 140 to 150 beats per minute.\\nI don't expect you to get super technical, break down the music that you're listening to.\\nThat is not my goal, nor is that really what this podcast is about.\\nI think occasionally people think that, you know, the goal of a science and science-based protocols podcast is to optimize everything.\\nIn fact, I'm not such a fan of the word optimized because optimal really depends on the situation that you happen to be in.\\nThe point here is simply this, that many people out there, including myself, have been listening to some of our favorite music while working, but it's very clear as to why that degrades cognitive performance.\\nWe know, for instance, that when we read, we are creating a semantic narrative in our own head.\\nAnd when we listen to music with lyrics, especially music with lyrics that we recognize, the semantic content of the song, the lyrics, competes with our comprehension of the narrative within our head from the material that we're supposed to be learning.\\nSo now it should be sort of obvious why listening to your favorite music that includes lyrics while trying to learn something else is going to impede learning.\\nIt's because you've got multiple scripts, multiple dialogues happening in your head.\\nAnd in fact, this is an opportunity for me to take a slight tangent, but a relevant one, which is to say, a lot of times people will ask me how I can retain a lot of information.\\nI confess I never use a teleprompter for podcasting.\\nI do have usually a short stack of notes, anywhere from one to six or seven pages of just bullet-pointed notes that cue up things that I want to talk about and that I have researched in the literature.\\nAnd then, of course, I'll refer to papers from time to time.\\nBut one of the things that's been very useful for me, which was taught to me, by the way, by a professor when I was in university, to read and retain information that I've read by memory is that when I read, I'm trying to listen to the words being spoken in my head, typically in my own voice, although sometimes in someone else's voice.\\nIt doesn't really matter, I find.\\nSo when I'm reading, yes, it's a process of visual scanning, but I'm also listening to the words within my head as if they're being spoken.\\nSome of you may be familiar with this because you do it.\\nOthers of you, perhaps, might find this a bit more foreign.\\nI'd be curious to know what your process of reading and retaining that information is, whether or not it includes an internal dialogue.\\nBut nonetheless, it should be very straightforward now to see why if you're listening to words that you're reading on a page, maybe even mumbling them a little bit, moving your lips a little bit while you read, which, by the way, if you heard our episode on language and auditory processing with Dr. Eddie Chang, who's chair of neurosurgery at UCSF, he talked about the fact that when we read any material, that the brain is generating pre-motor activity, you now know what pre-motor activity is, pre-motor activity down to the muscles of the throat, larynx and pharynx, which would speak those words were those signals to get above a certain level, but that when we read, typically, the signals that are getting sent through those pre-motor circuits are just below the threshold of what would have us actually speak those words.\\nPut simply, when we read, we are just shy of saying what we are reading.\\nAnd so when I say that when I read, I'm listening to the words in my head, that's what I'm referring to.\\nSo we're starting to funnel in on some general principles of music and how it impacts the brain and how that can be leveraged toward better learning and better motivation, both in the context of physical and cognitive endeavors.\\nOkay, so if you want to get motivated, listening to music prior to doing something that you're trying to motivate to do is a good idea.\\nThat's what the data say.\\nIf you're trying to learn something that's cognitive, that requires reading, focus, and concentration, silence, 40 Hertz, binaural beats, white noise or brown noise is probably best.\\nAnd if you are going to listen to music, listening to music that includes instrumentals, but not lyrics would be best.\\nAnd listening to music that includes lyrics that you're very familiar with would be the worst condition.\\nNow, with that said, there are nice studies, and by the way, I'm going to link to a number of reviews and primary studies in the show note captions that refer back to this point I'm about to tell you, which is that listening to music while trying to do cognitive tasks can be detrimental toward learning that material.\\nTurns out that if you listen to music in the breaks between trying to learn certain material, you can actually heighten your level of cognition and focus and your ability to learn.\\nSo I find this particularly cool.\\nIt's not that music is bad for focusing cognition and learning.\\nIt's that listening to music, especially music that you're familiar with that includes lyrics at the same time as trying to learn something else is not a good idea.\\nBut listening to music with lyrics, especially music with lyrics that you're familiar with that you find particularly uplifting and motivating is a cognitive and performance enhancer when you go back to doing that work in silence, or perhaps while listening to white noise, brown noise, or 40 Hertz binaural beats.\\nSo like so many things, the answer is not black and white.\\nIt's not that silence is better than music or that music is bad for learning.\\nIt turns out that listening to music, even music with lyrics you're very familiar with can be highly beneficial for learning, but that you want to listen to that music in the breaks between these bouts of cognitive work.\\nNow, I've done previous podcasts that talk about how long a bout of cognitive work can or should be.\\nTypically 90 minutes is going to be the upper limit before you take a break.\\nSome people can't work for 90 minutes without a break.\\nAnd by the way, folks, when I say without a break, I don't mean remaining in a deep trench of focus for 90 minutes.\\nNobody does that.\\nActually, I suppose there are a few folks that with neurochemical assistance, or just by way of training can get themselves into a deep, deep trench of focus for 90 minutes or more, but most people are going to focus on something and then have their attention flit out of focus, and then they're going to have to draw their focus back to whatever it is they're doing.\\nThat's not just typical, that's absolutely normal.\\nAnd you shouldn't be concerned at all if you try and focus for three minutes and find your attention jumping around two or three times during that attempt.\\nBut if you're somebody who is going to do, say a 90 minute or even 60 minute or even 30 minute bout of work, and you are going to get up for a moment and use the restroom, or you're going to take a break in between bouts of work.\\nSo maybe you work for 30 minutes, take 10 minutes or five minutes off, or 90 minutes, take 30 minutes off, listening to music in those breaks, it seems can increase our ability to focus and to learn new material once we return to those bouts of cognitive focus.\\nNow, when it comes to physical exertion, cardiovascular exercise, resistance training of any kind, many people, including myself, like to listen to music while performing that physical exercise or that physical exertion.\\nThe data on whether or not music improve physical performance is a bit mixed.\\nCertainly you can find studies that show that it improves physical output.\\nOther studies will say that it doesn't make a difference.\\nOther studies will say that it reduces physical output.\\nHowever, this is a very important, however, the type of physical exercise is not very well matched between those different studies.\\nSo this is something that I believe is going to be highly individual.\\nIn accordance with the published data, I mix it up.\\nThere are times when I will head out for a run or I will do a resistance training session and I will listen to music, usually an album all the way through or a playlist all the way through, and that's because I don't want to be going onto my phone very often.\\nIn fact, these days I use an older separate phone that doesn't have any text messaging or communication to the outside world, but it has music loaded into it or onto it.\\nThat allows me to just listen to music so that I don't run the risk of getting distracted texting and doing things like that.\\nI just want to focus on my physical exercise.\\nI should say that phone also has audio books, podcasts, things I've downloaded to it.\\nSo it's a place where I can listen to things but not communicate with the outside world, at least while exercising.\\nSome people do very well to listen to music, literally in between and during their sets of resistance training throughout their entire runs.\\nIt's going to be individual.\\nYou have to figure out what's best for you.\\nHowever, one of the most interesting things about the scientific literature on this shows that if people listen to music, in particular music that tends to be faster, more upbeat, typically it's going to be in these studies, rock and roll music as opposed to classical.\\nAlthough there are some studies that have explored classical and other forms of music as it relates to exercise, listening to that music in between bouts of exertion.\\nSo in the rest between sets of resistance training or periodically during say a run or about a cycling can indeed enhance performance in a way that at least by my read of the data exceeds that which is observed when people just listen to music throughout.\\nIn other words, if you find it useful to listen to music before, during and after your workouts, great, be my guest.\\nHowever, what the data say is that switching up between silence and listening to music.\\nAnd in this case, it would be listening to music that you're very familiar with and that can evoke a sense of motivation and desired action in you for whatever reason, the music, the beat, the memories that it draws you to, et cetera.\\nWell, then that's going to be useful.\\nSo there really isn't one protocol for how to get the most out of music for sake of physical exertion.\\nBut if you're interested in playing with some of these variables as they've been examined within the peer reviewed literature, I find it interesting.\\nAnd indeed I found it useful to, for instance, do a workout where I only listen to music in between sets of resistance training or to listen to music prior to going out for a run.\\nAnd then oftentimes when I do that, the song will or songs will be sort of on loop in my head.\\nAlthough I confess that a lot of times nowadays I listen to podcasts while I run or while I hike.\\nAnd when I'm in the gym and I'm doing resistance training I like to listen to music as opposed to content that requires that I really focus very heavily on that content, such as a podcast, such as a book.\\nI'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor InsideTracker.\\nInsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health goals.\\nI'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.\\nHowever, with a lot of blood tests out there you get information back about blood lipids about hormones and so on but you don't know what to do with that information.\\nWith InsideTracker they have a personalized platform that makes it very easy to understand your data.\\nThat is to understand what those lipids what

music to shift our mood and indeed to get us out of states of anxiety.\\nThis is a really interesting scientific literature with some very specific actionable takeaways that I think everyone will find beneficial.\\nI certainly did.\\nHowever, I want to point out that we don't need a scientific study to illustrate for us the way that music can shift our mood.\\nAnd you already know why it is that listening to a sad song can sometimes make us feel sad listening to happy music can make us feel happy.\\nIt's because when we listen to music there are some fundamental components of that music literally the mathematical structure of that music including the frequency of sounds the cadence of those sounds as well as the lyrics but even in the absence of lyrics that are activating brain circuits within us such that the frequencies of sound that we're hearing are evoking firing of neurons in the brain of the same frequency.\\nIn other words, your brain becomes a bit of a piano playing the same song that you're hearing inside your head.\\nNow that's sort of a duh, right? You hear music in your head even if you're listening to it from outside in the room.\\nBut when you understand that neurons speak the language of electrochemical communication what we're talking about here is particular music evoking the release of neurochemicals in your brain at a particular frequency.\\nSo just think about that for a second.\\nWe know that neurochemicals such as dopamine, serotonin some of the so-called endogenous opioids, right? These aren't opioids that people take.\\nThis isn't related to the opioid crisis.\\nWe're talking about endogenous opioids that are released in response to music things like exercise different types of social interactions.\\nThose and other chemicals are released according to the firing of specific neurons.\\nAnd we know that when you listen to music at particular frequencies arranged in particular motifs, et cetera that the neurons that release those neurochemicals are firing at those same frequencies.\\nIn other words, that the sound is causing a sound dependent pharmacologic concert within your brain.\\nSo that fact should make it incredibly clear as to why certain music, even in the absence of lyrics can evoke certain emotional states.\\nCertain sound frequencies are transformed into the neural language within your brain that releases certain neurochemicals that create certain emotional states of brain and body.\\nJust to drill in how incredible that really is a little bit further, if you see a beautiful painting or the picture or presence of somebody's face in real life that evokes a particularly strong positive or negative emotion, you can imagine that of course it creates the release of certain neurochemicals or perhaps in the case of a negative face suppresses the release of certain neurochemicals.\\nBut we can't say that a particular frequency of color say reds against oranges or the presence of a rainbow evokes a sort of rainbow like cascade of neurochemicals whereas with sound, that's exactly what's happening.\\nAnd this isn't to diminish the value of vision in terms of its ability to evoke emotional states within us.\\nAfter all, I'm foremost a neuroscientist but under the umbrella of neuroscientists, I started off as and I continue to be a vision neuroscientist studying the visual system and its ability to evoke emotional states within us.\\nBut I have to acknowledge that the auditory system and in particular the circuits in the brain that respond to music have a remarkably potent ability to evoke these emotional states.\\nWhich is why when surveys have been done asking people why they listen to music, the responses that have come back generally resemble the following statistics.\\nApproximately 90% of people say they listen to music to relax, approximately 82% of people self-report that they listen to music in order to make themselves happy.\\nApproximately 46.5% of people say that they listen to music in order to process particular states of emotion.\\nWe'll get back to what process means in a moment.\\nBut more often than not, when these studies have asked specific questions about what particular types of emotions people are listening to in order to process their emotions better, it is the emotion of sadness.\\nAnd 32.5% of people report that they listen to music in order to increase their sense of concentration.\\nAnd we already talked about the role of music in concentration or its ability in some cases to inhibit concentration a few minutes ago.\\nNow, you might be asking yourself, how can 90% of people listen to music for one thing and 82% of people for another thing and so on and so forth were well over 100% of people? Well, in this survey and other surveys like it, people had the option to give multiple reasons for listening to music because of course, most people have multiple reasons for listening to music.\\nNow, with that said, if we are to examine this one particular category, nearly half of people who report listening to music on a regular basis listen to music in order to process their emotions.\\nWe can ask, what does the scientific literature tell us about how certain types of music evoke certain types of emotions or help us process certain emotions? Again, we'll get back to what we mean by process in a moment.\\nBut a number of studies have been done on this.\\nThere's some meta-analyses that converge on some general themes, what I refer to as the center of mass of data, right? When there are a lot of studies in a given area, the outcomes of some of those studies conflict with one another.\\nGenerally in a good meta-analysis, what happens is different studies are considered more powerful or less powerful than others depending on how many subjects were involved, the different control conditions or lack of control conditions and so on and so forth.\\nThis is one of the great values of meta-analyses is that they don't treat all studies equally.\\nThey separate out studies based on their level of rigor and thoroughness.\\nWell, what we can say with confidence is that music that makes us, quote unquote, happy or tends to shift people's state from less happy to happier, regardless of how they entered the experiment, tends to be faster music, meaning music that on average contains 140 to 150 beats per minute or faster, okay? And there's some other features to, quote unquote, happy music, if you will, that it tends to be in a major key, that if there are lyrics to that music, that the lyrics tend to report things that are happy or, get this, total nonsense.\\nIn fact, when the type of lyrics in this, quote unquote, happy music's, I guess, singing about great events in life and positive things, falling in love, being in love, positive memories, birth of children, connection to friends, great adventures, those lyrics, or I should say that music containing those lyrics was no more effective in creating states of happiness than was music of equivalent cadence.\\nSo again, music that was 140 to 150 beats per minute or faster on average.\\nWell, even if the lyrics were complete nonsense, even if the vocalizations weren't actual words, it still evoked the same increase in the level of happiness in the subjects than when compared to the music containing coherent lyrics around happy events.\\nWhat this means is that the cadence of music is no doubt the critical variable when one is trying to shift one's mood from a state of whatever, could be depressed or sad, to non-depressed, non-sad, or neutral to positive, and so on and so forth.\\nBut what this also explains is one-hit wonders.\\nRarely, if ever, by the way, are one-hit wonders sad and depressing songs? Sometimes, almost always.\\nThese one-hit wonders are songs that are very effective in shifting people's mood from not so happy to happier, or we could just say happier, regardless of where they started out before listening to the song, they feel better while and after listening to the song.\\nAnd indeed, more often than not, the lyrical content of those songs is not particularly meaningful.\\nIt's not addressing a particularly meaningful state or issue.\\nIt's just what some people call a party song, or it's something that's just uplifting, not just to them, but to many other people, which actually brings up an interesting and future-looking point, which is that nowadays, we are seeing the emergence of AI, artificial intelligence, being used to generate new songs by capturing these well-established rules gleaned from neuroscience of how music impacts the brain, such that in the future, artificial intelligence is going to be generating hit songs for us, as opposed to having people generating hit songs.\\nI know this evokes a state of concern and fear in many people.\\nI think that this is a fear that needs to be matched with, I don't know, perhaps a cautious optimism.\\nI mean, who knows? Maybe there are patterns of music, including lyrics, that human beings in their current understanding of themselves and of music have not yet been able to tap into.\\nAnd who knows, maybe AI will be generating the best music that we've ever heard, or perhaps music that can shift our states from more depressed or sad to heightened levels of happiness in ways that humans have just not been able to accomplish.\\nSo I think it's important to balance any pessimism about AI and its ability to generate music based on these rules of how music impacts the brain with an open-mindedness.\\nAfter all, neuroscience, neuroimaging, and neural recordings directly with electrodes in the brain, while people are listening to music, is teaching us how the brain responds to that music and is giving us information that indeed human beings, but also computers, can use in order to generate stimuli, music that can shift our brain into more positive states.\\nAnd if that's the case, wouldn't that be wonderful? Another established feature of happy music is, get this, its ability to get people to relax the furrow of their brow, indeed to raise their eyebrows and to be a bit wide-eyed, and not just through autonomic arousal, but rather through activation of the muscles in the face.\\nConversely, we know that sad music, and here we can define sad music.\\nThis has actually been done in the literature.\\nSad music tends to be slower than average, slower than 60 beats per minute or so, again, on average.\\nAnd this again is independent of the lyrics that might not even be present in the song.\\nSad music tends to activate the corrugator muscles of the forehead, which are the muscles that furrow the brow and that lead to a kind of serious look.\\nIt's a folding in of the face, as opposed to a widening up of the eyes and a relaxation of the brow.\\nNow, given where we are in the course of this discussion, that shouldn't be surprising.\\nWe already talked about how listening to particular sounds evokes the release of particular neurochemicals, but in a more direct fashion, listening to particular sounds activates certain pre-motor and motor circuits within the brain and body, not just the desire to move one's torso, limbs, or both, bob one's head or move a head side to side, but also the micro structures of the face, which, because one of the main roles of the face is to communicate emotion, is going to cause either a relaxation of the brow and a lifting of the eyebrows or a furrowing or a activation of the corrugator muscles of the eyebrow.\\nAnd if that's not obvious and yet interesting enough, well, get this, there seems to be a direct relationship.\\nI'm chuckling because this still just blows my mind because it's a total duh, obvious when you hear it, but it's still just so cool that there's a direct relationship of the frequency of the sound that you hear, either low-pitched or high-pitched, and the cadence of that sound, and here I realize I'm not using technical music theory language, but whether or not that particular tone is played over and over, close in time or more spaced out in time, and facial expressions.\\nAnd indeed, when we listen to bass tones, low-frequency tones set apart from one another with some distance so that they're not overlapping, we get the all too familiar bass face.\\nSo what I'm referring to here is what neuroscientists would call a labeled line, literally a circuit of neurons that goes from the periphery, in this case, our ears, into our brain through several different stations and then wicks out to impact all sorts of things within us, states of emotion, states of motivation, our propensity to move, but also a labeled line circuit coming from hearing low-frequency sounds played spaced apart from one another that evokes a particular facial expression.\\nAnd again, this takes us back to the earlier statement that I made, which is not an original statement, frankly.\\nThere are people within the field of auditory processing and understanding how the brain processes music.\\nIn fact, one of the world experts in this, Dr. Eric Jarvis at the Rockefeller University was a guest on this podcast where we talked about the relationship between music, movement, and singing, and the fact that music, movement, in particular dance and singing likely preceded the evolution of modern spoken language.\\nWell, Eric Jarvis and others have argued quite convincingly that these circuits that I'm calling labeled lines to particular facial expressions and states of emotion are the most fundamental components of communication and the ways that humans have communicated about their emotional state and literally induced that same emotional state in other members of our species dating back tens of thousands, if not more years.\\nOne of the fun things about researching this episode on music and the brain is that there are a lot of quality studies exploring how music impacts the brain, neuroimaging, neural recording data from excellent laboratories, as well as a lot of studies.\\nIn fact, a surprising number of studies exploring how particular types of music impacts mood states.\\nAnd fortunately, that allowed me to glean some very specific recommendations as to the minimum amounts of say happy music that you need to listen to in order to shift your mood into a happier state.\\nAnd indeed the numbers exist in the literature and it has been shown that the threshold for significantly shifting one's mood into a happier state by listening to the sorts of music we talked about before, that faster cadence music, even with nonsense lyrics, although it could include other lyrics, instead is nine minutes, not 10, not eight, but nine.\\nAnd I'm sort of joking when I say not 10, not eight, but nine because of course you could listen to music for 10 minutes or 15 minutes or longer.\\nIn fact, earlier we talked about the benefits of doing that.\\nBut when one examines the various studies that looked at how long subjects need to listen to music in order to shift their mood into a happier state, the threshold seems to be nine minutes.\\nSo if you want to feel happier than you currently feel, it seems that listening to happy music for nine minutes or more is going to be the effective approach.\\nOkay, so nine minutes or more to shift one state to happier.\\nWhat about to process somber or sad feelings, feelings of loss? Well, this raises an even bigger question and it's a question that I also get very often.\\nAs you're noticing, I get a lot of questions often.\\nIn any event, one of the common questions that I get is when we are feeling sad or experiencing a loss, grieving the loss of a relationship by death or decision or by somebody moving away or the loss of a pet, et cetera, is it better to go into that state? In other words, to quote unquote, feel one's feelings or to counter those feelings.\\nNow, historically that's been a very difficult question for me to answer because who am I to say whether or not you should feel your feelings or whether or not feeling those feelings will take you down a trench of feeling much worse or much better.\\nIn fact, there's an emerging literature exactly about that issue.\\nThat is whether or not the catharsis model is really best catharsis being the expression and feeling of one's emotions as a way to extrude or get rid of those emotions or whether or not that simply drives us further down the trench of those emotions.\\nThat's really something that we should address in a separate podcast episode.\\nAnd I will have experts from the fields of psychiatry and psychology to help us address that question directly.\\nBut since we're talking about music in the brain and the fact that music has a tremendous capacity to evoke emotional states, including sad states, what has been shown in the peer-reviewed literature is that when people who are feeling sad, for whatever reason, loss of relationship, death, who knows, doesn't really matter why they're feeling sad after all, it's that they're feeling sad, listening to 13 minutes or more of sad music, that music can contain lyrics they are familiar with or no lyrics, regardless of whether or not it contains lyrics, it's going to be on average 50 or 60 beats per minute or less, we established that already.\\nListening to that for 13 minutes or more has been shown to be effective in allowing people to quote unquote process their somber feelings and to some extent to move past their feelings of sadness.\\nSo those studies support the idea that when feeling sad, feeling one's feelings and perhaps even amplifying those feelings of sadness by listening to sad music for 13 minutes or more can help people process those sad feelings.\\nAnd while that point might seem overly reductionist, I actually think it's a real value.\\nI'm certainly familiar with feelings of loss, feelings of grief.\\nAnd I've often struggled with this question of, gosh, do I try and just push it aside or do I deal with those feelings? Again, this is something that you really need to determine for yourself.\\nBut what these studies show pretty conclusively is that when we're feeling sad, matching that sadness or amplifying that sadness by listening to sad music for 13 minutes or more can help us move through that state of sadness.\\nAnd one could argue this is more or less the use of catharsis of amplifying emotional expression or feeling in order to try and move that feeling out is a classic idea originating in Freudian psychology, but probably before then as well.\\nBut in any event, I think these data support the idea that even when feeling sad, perhaps especially when feeling sad, amplifying or matching those feelings through the use of sad music for 13 minutes or more, again, you don't need to set a timer for 13 minutes, but giving yourself a period of time to just listen to that music is one way that can help you move through that state of sadness and then be able to lean back into other areas of life.\\nSo we've talked about the role of music in evoking or shifting states of happiness and sadness.\\nThere are also interesting data that support the use of music for shifting one out of a state of heightened anxiety.\\nAnd I find this especially interesting because my laboratory for a long time has worked on behavioral interventions to reduce anxiety, things like the physiological sigh, which if you're not familiar with, you can put physiological sigh in my last name into YouTube and there's a demonstration of that.\\nIt's a breathing technique of two inhales through the nose and a long exhale through the mouth to lungs empty that at this point in time, we understand to be the fastest and most effective way to reduce one's levels of anxiety in real time.\\nSo it's two inhales through the nose, long to lungs empty, exhale through the mouth.\\nThat's the physiological sigh.\\nEarlier, we talked about the fact that one of the main ways in which listening to music shifts heart rate and increases heart rate variability and thereby positively shifts a number of different health metrics is through shifts in breathing.\\nSo I justify that brief vignette about the physiological sigh as within the general context of what we're talking about today.\\nIn any event, there are data that have explored whether or not specific musical stimuli can be used to significantly reduce anxiety.\\nIn particular, one published out of the University of Pennsylvania and I'll provide a link to this study in the show note captions, which shows that people that listen to a particular song that I'll describe in a moment experience up to 65% reductions in their anxiety.\\nThat's a significant reduction in anxiety.\\nAnd I should point out that 65% reduction in anxiety in this case was accomplished with just three minutes of listening to this one particular song and get this, that particular song was as effective in reducing anxiety as one of the most commonly prescribed benzodiazepines.\\nSo what is this magical anxiety reducing song? The title of the song is Weightless by Marconi Union.\\nI hadn't heard of this song prior to researching this episode.\\nI did indeed look up the song on YouTube and listen to the song.\\nI will provide a link to the song in the show note captions.\\nI confess that it is a very relaxing song.\\nI also confess that I was not experiencing anxiety when I listened to the song, but it was successful in reducing my level of overall autonomic arousal.\\nI found myself more relaxed, et cetera.\\nNow, of course, what I'm describing in terms of my own experience is not a peer-reviewed study.\\nIt's what I would call ANIC data, meaning I'm just describing my experience.\\nBut again, there are peer-reviewed studies exploring how this particular song shifts one's autonomic state.\\nAnd I think this three minutes of listening to this one song should at least be tried by anyone that's trying to reduce their anxiety.\\nBecause unless you're listening to the song in some way that I'm not aware of, like excessively loud or something of that sort, I can't imagine how listening to the song would be detrimental in any way.\\nAnd if you are anything like the subjects in the study that they explored, it could very well be beneficial and help you reduce your anxiety.\\nIt's also something that you could keep queued up in your phone or on any device, such that if you think you may experience anxiety, you just put your headphones in and listen to it.\\nYou might be wondering whether or not Marconi Union's Waitlist is only three minutes long.\\nWell, I don't know the answer to that because when you go on YouTube, what you'll see is that clearly a number of people are benefiting from listening to the song to reduce their anxiety, or at least that a number of people have listened to this song.\\nBecause if you put Marconi Union Waitlist into the search function on YouTube, what you'll quickly discover is that the top video has, get this, 47 million views.\\nAnd it's 10 hours long.\\nNow across today's episode, it's been in the back of my mind that some of you out there perhaps are trained musicians, that you grew up playing an instrument, perhaps sang in choir or at school, perhaps you played multiple instruments, perhaps you even know music theory.\\nWhereas others, such as myself, were encouraged to play an instrument when we were younger, but then abandoned that instrument.\\nIn fact, I'll just tell you a brief story.\\nWhen I was a kid, every kid in school was required to pick an instrument.\\nMy parents, for whatever reason, clearly they didn't ask me what I wanted to do.\\nThey asked me to play the violin in school.\\nAnd I got the violin.\\nI started playing the violin.\\nI took the Suzuki Method lessons.\\nThis is where you don't learn to read music directly.\\nThere's a number assignment to the different notes, and that's initially how you learn.\\nI was also supposed to listen to the songs while I slept, this idea that some of the music and musical learning could be encoded during sleep.\\nAn interesting topic, because there's actually some emerging evidence for that now.\\nBut at the time, as far as I know, there were no peer-reviewed studies, but nonetheless, I thought that this works, and perhaps it does.\\nWell, I can tell you one thing for sure, it did not work for me, because I have one photo, and truly just one, from a concert that I played.\\nI must have been about eight or nine years old.\\nAnd within this photo, what you'll notice is there's a gallery of children, all with violins, all of whom's bows are up, and my bow is down.\\nThat in addition to the fact that my fly was open in the picture, and the fact that every time I played the violin, either by practice or with the teacher present, when we would go to these once a week sessions with an individual teacher, people would cringe, animals would cringe, literally dogs would howl, such that my parents did not encourage me to continue playing.\\nIn fact, they and many others encouraged me to quit playing.\\nSo I quit playing.\\nI confess, I don't know how to play any instrument.\\nI've attempted a few other instruments in my lifetime.\\nYes, I believe in neuroplasticity.\\nIt is a hallmark feature of our brain.\\nOur brain can learn things, even as adults.\\nBut the point I'm trying to make here is that I am not of the category of kids that played an instrument, and understands music theory or how to read music.\\nI simply don't.\\nAnd I realized that those of you that are listening to this or watching this out there are probably in a mixed category of proficiency all the way down to what I would consider my own relationship to music, which is deficiency.\\nAlthough I greatly enjoy listening to music, and I do have a pretty good ability to memorize lyrics.\\nIn any event, the reason I raise this is that there are now dozens, if not hundreds of quality peer-reviewed studies using a variety of technical approaches that show that when children, especially children younger than eight, learn to play an instrument, and even better, learn to play multiple instruments, regardless of whether or not they learn to read music, that it leads to greatly enhanced connectivity within their brain that persists into adulthood, and that it facilitates other forms of neuroplasticity and learning, which is basically to say that my brain very likely does not include these enhanced circuits, which circuits am I referring to? Well, there are a number of different circuits in the brain that have been shown to expand when children learn how to play an instrument as a child, eight or younger.\\nAnd again, eight isn't a strict cutoff, and I always have to highlight this, forgive the tangent, but when we say eight or younger, I don't want people with nine-year-old children or a 10-year-old kid or even 16-year-old kid listening or even adult listening to think, oh, the window is shut for me, because when one designs a study, you have to have some thresholds of who you include and who you don't include, and sometimes that leads to these kind of artificial perceptions about where the cutoffs are, but in any event, it's very clear that if you did learn an instrument when you were young, or ideally even multiple instruments, and even better would be to learn multiple instruments and how to sing along with instrumentals, especially in an improvised manner, well, your brain has expanded connectivity on average relative to children that did not have that experience.\\nNow, the good news is that learning how to play an instrument or even, thankfully for me, listening to novel forms of music, music that you don't typically listen to for 30 to 60 minutes per day, and it doesn't have to be every day, in fact, it can even be just three days a week for 30 to 60 minutes, has been shown to expand brain connectivity in ways that, of course, lends itself to better musical comprehension and even performance, but learning how to play a musical instrument at any age, as well as singing, and singing, especially with others in a group, has been shown to enhance learning and the acquisition of new skills separate from musical learning and singing.\\nIn other words, it seems that learning how to play an instrument and singing are a gateway to neuroplasticity, and this is, again, supported by neuroimaging data.\\nSome of the more striking of those data are that children that learned how to play one to three instruments when they were a kid, or that sang in a choir or a group, or that were taught to sing solo, for that matter, show up to 30% greater connectivity within this particular brain network that links the two hemispheres of the brain.\\nNow, as soon as I say two hemispheres of the brain, it starts drawing up a lot of ideas in people's heads, mainly derived from pop psychology, that there are left-brained people and right-brained people.\\nI've touched on this before, but I want to make this abundantly clear again now.\\nMost of what you've heard about so-called left-brained people or right-brained people is complete and total nonsense.\\nIt's myth.\\nThere are some functions in the brain that are lateralized to the left or the right hemisphere, in particular, prosody.\\nThe sort of lilting and falling of speech and in singing is highly lateralized in the brain.\\nOther aspects of language can be lateralized in the brain, but really, if you hear that certain people are more emotional or certain people are more logical based on right-brain, left-brain stuff, that stuff is completely false.\\nIt's complete garbage, in fact.\\nIt's not based in any real solid data.\\nSo when I say that learning an instrument or learning how to sing young or even as an adult is beneficial for increasing the connectivity between the two sides of the brain, what that increased connectivity between the two sides of the brain, which is, by the way, mediated through a structure called the corpus callosum, is not about enhancing one's emotional capacity or logical capacity.\\nIt's really about increasing the capacity of all brain circuits, or at least the brain circuits that are connected up directly with the corpus callosum, which includes many brain circuits for things like cognition, language learning, speech, mathematics.\\nA lot of people don't realize this, but a lot of musicians are also especially adept at mathematics.\\nAnd for you musicians, you're probably nodding, of course, right, because music is grounded in theory that has basis in math and in physics, something that we will address in a future episode about harmonics, et cetera.\\nWhen children or adults learn how to play a musical instrument or several, or how to sing and play musical instruments, that increased connectivity in the corpus callosum is essentially providing multiple highways of option for learning all sorts of things.\\nSo it's something that I highly encourage, so much so that I intend to finally, finally, learn how to play an instrument.\\nI've got a particular instrument in mind that I've wanted to learn how to play for a very long time, but based on my prior experience with trying to learn an instrument, and because I like to consider myself a considerate person, I intend to do this more or less in isolation from people and indeed from animals as well.\\nAnd for those of you that don't have the time or energy or desire to learn new forms of music, you'll be perhaps delighted to know that just listening to novel forms of music, and in particular, when you listen to novel forms of music and you pay attention to that music, not just letting it play in the background, that too has been demonstrated to expand the brain's capacity for neuroplasticity, its ability to modify itself and make it better at learning other sorts of things, both cognitive and physical.\\nSo I highly encourage you to listen to the music you love.\\nI certainly love to listen to the music that I delight in and have for so many years, but there's also strong scientific support to encourage listening to new forms of music that hopefully you will like, but nonetheless, the mere forging for and listening to novel forms of music itself seems to activate brain circuitry in a way that allows for better learning and comprehension of all sorts of things.\\nSo today we've been talking about music in the brain, and I confess, this is an enormous topic, so much so that I had to discard with entire sets of data and discussion around, for instance, the mathematical structure of music and how that relates to the mathematical structure of firing of neurons.\\nWe touched on this a little bit, however, in the context of certain frequencies of sounds that we hear, creating certain frequencies of neuronal firing and activation in the brain.\\nI mean, just think about that, how amazing that is.\\nIt's literally like the brain playing your neurons like a piano.\\nThis is not what happens when you smell a particular odor or taste a particular taste or see a particular face or visual stimulus.\\nIncredible things happen within those senses as well, but there is something oh so fundamental and incredible about music in its ability to tap into our neural circuitry and our neural chemistry in ways that shift our emotional states and our motivational states.\\nSo we talked about ways that music can be leveraged to shift our emotional and motivational states.\\nAgain, not as a way to reduce music to its reductionist parts, but rather to help us gain understanding into how the brain responds to music and how we can leverage music of all kinds, with and without lyrics, how we can balance the contrast between music and silence to increase motivation and so on and so on.\\nFor those of you that are interested in the more formal structure of music and how it relates to brain function and vice versa, as well as for those of you that are interested in singing and songwriting and more along the lines of lyrical content and how singing in groups and how improvisation of singing and musical playing can impact brain function and plasticity, I promise you there's going to be both an expert guest coming on the podcast to discuss that as well as a solo episode on those topics.\\nAgain, the topic of music and the brain being far too vast to cover in just one conversation.\\nWith that said, I hope that today's discussion allowed for you to think about music differently.\\nHopefully it will lead you to listen to music a bit differently, perhaps even leverage music for different purposes in your life.\\nAnd above all, to think about music and to enjoy music, either listening to it or playing it or both, because as you now know, music isn't just able to activate your brain, but rather your brain contains vast amounts of real estate that are literally there to listen to music.\\nIf you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast, please subscribe to our YouTube channel.\\nThat's a terrific zero cost

       " Document(page_content=\"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.\\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.\\nToday, we are going to discuss the science and practice of flexibility and stretching.\\nFlexibility and stretching are topics that I believe do not receive nearly as much attention as they deserve.\\nFor most people, the topics of flexibility and stretching bring to mind things like yoga, injury prevention, or maybe even contortionism.\\nBut it turns out that flexibility and stretching are features that are built into our basic body plan.\\nYoung children, young animals, and adults, and indeed older children and animals, all stretch and all have some degree of flexibility.\\nIt turns out that having flexibility and our ability to stretch and the interaction between stretching and flexibility are fundamental to how we move, our ability to learn new movements, indeed also to prevent injury or repair injuries, and to offsetting and reducing inflammation throughout the body.\\nIn fact, today, I'm going to share with you a remarkable set of studies that show that stretching can actually adjust things like tumor growth.\\nThis is work that was done by one of the major directors of the National Institutes of Health.\\nSo today's discussion will start with a description of the mechanisms, literally the cells and the connections from your nervous system that mediate flexibility and stretching.\\nAnd I promise that I'll make that information accessible to you, whether or not you have a biology background or not.\\nThen with that information in hand, I'm going to present to you what the scientific literature says about the best times and ways to stretch.\\nEverything right down to the detail of how long to hold a stretch, whether or not to hold a stretch at all, because it turns out there are multiple kinds of stretching.\\nSo you can imagine you have stretches where you hold the stretch for a very long time and use as little momentum as possible.\\nAnd then there's also what's called dynamic and ballistic stretching, where you're literally swinging your limbs, trying to increase the range of motion.\\nI will explain the science and application of flexibility and stretching in the context of sports performance, whether or not you're engaging in cardiovascular exercise or resistance exercise or both, whether or not you're a competitive athlete or simply a recreational exerciser, as I am, whether or not you are trying to increase your range of motion and flexibility for longevity purposes, or whether or not you're trying to do it in order to access different parts of your nervous system, because we'll soon learn today that your ability to improve flexibility and indeed to engage in specific stretching exercises can actually be used to powerfully modulate your ability to tolerate pain, both emotional and physical pain.\\nSo this thing that we call flexibility and stretching is actually a vast landscape.\\nWe're going to simplify and organize all that for you today.\\nAnd by the end of today's episode, you're going to have a number of simple, easy to apply tools that are grounded in the best scientific research that you can apply for your specific goals.\\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.\\nIt is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public.\\nIn keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.\\nOur first sponsor is Thesis.\\nThesis makes custom nootropics that are designed to get your brain and body into the optimal state for the cognitive and physical things that you need to perform at the highest level.\\nI have to confess, in fact, I've said it many times before, I am not a fan of the word nootropics because it means smart drugs.\\nAnd frankly, as a neuroscientist, I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge that there's really no circuit in your brain for being smart.\\nYou have neural circuits in your brain that are designed to get you to focus very well or to task switch very well or to be creative.\\nThesis understands this.\\nAnd as a consequence, they've designed nootropics that are tailored to your specific needs in the cognitive and physical realm.\\nWhat I mean by that is if you go to the Thesis site, you fill out a short quiz, and they'll give you the opportunity to try a small kit of different nootropics with different ingredients.\\nYou have the opportunity to try several different blends over the course of the month and discover which nootropics work best for your unique brain chemistry and genetics.\\nI've been using Thesis for about eight and a half months now, and I can confidently say that their nootropics have been a game changer.\\nTo get your own personalized nootropic starter kit, you can go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman.\\nThere, you'll find that three-minute quiz, and Thesis will send you four different formulas to try in your first month.\\nThat's takethesis.com slash Huberman, and use the code Huberminute at checkout to get 10% off your first box.\\nToday's episode is also brought to us by InsideTracker.\\nInsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals.\\nI've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.\\nOne issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there is that you get information back about hormone levels, metabolic factors, et cetera, but you don't know what to do with that information.\\nInsideTracker has a very easy-to-use personalized platform that lets you look at those numbers, and then you can literally move your cursor over those numbers, and there are little pop-up windows that will tell you the things that you can do in terms of lifestyle, so exercise, and nutrition, supplementation, and so on, to bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you.\\nSo it really takes all the guesswork out of what to do with that blood work and DNA information.\\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can visit InsideTracker.com slash Huberman to get 20%

literally program the temperature of your sleeping environment from the time you go to sleep until the time you wake up in the morning.\\nThis turns out to be immensely powerful because, as I've talked about on the podcast before, in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep throughout the night, your body has to drop by about one to three degrees, and waking up in the morning actually involves a warming up of your body temperature.\\nFor many people, they just can't precisely control their sleep environment well enough in order for all that to go well.\\nI was one such person, so for a long time, I'd fall asleep pretty easily, but then I'd wake up in the middle of the night.\\nI tended to run warm, but then sometimes I'd feel really tired in the morning as if I couldn't wake up.\\nI started sleeping on an eight-sleep mattress cover.\\nI programmed it so that the temperature would be rather cool in the early part of the evening when I would get into bed, and then would drop into the deeper phases of the night when I was entering deep sleep, and then rapid eye movement sleep, and then would warm towards morning.\\nIt would help me wake up quickly.\\nAnd as a consequence, I'm sleeping throughout the night now, and I'm waking up feeling completely refreshed.\\nIf you'd like to try an eight-sleep mattress cover, you can go to eightsleep.com slash Huberman to

your nervous system and into your body that allow you to be flexible.\\nSome of us feel tighter than others, sometimes in specific limbs or areas of our body.\\nSome people feel really loose and limber.\\nSome people even have what's called a hyper-flexibility.\\nI, for instance, have a relative that can take her fingers and bend them back to the point where they touch her wrist, and it always makes me cringe a little bit, but she can do that without any pain.\\nShe seems to have some hyper-flexibility in her joints.\\nI do not have that feature.\\nSome of you may find that you are more flexible than others naturally.\\nAnd some of you might be thinking, you don't need to build in additional flexibility.\\nWell, I think by the end of today's episode, you'll realize that almost all of us can benefit from having some sort of understanding about flexibility and having some stretching protocol that we incorporate into our life, if not just for physical performance reasons and for postural reasons, then also for cognitive and mental reasons.\\nAnd I'll be sure to clarify what all of that means.\\nRight now, I'd like to take a moment and just highlight the flexibility that you already have.\\nFor instance, if you were to move your arm behind your torso a little bit and then sort of let go or stop exerting any effort in doing that, you would find that the limb would return more or less to a position next to your torso, at least I would hope so.\\nWhy is that? Well, it turns out that there are aspects of your nervous system, aspects of your skeletal system, aspects of your muscles and aspects of the connective tissue that binds all of that together, that try and restore a particular order or position to your limbs and your limbs relative to one another.\\nSo that reflects a very specific set of processes that it turns out are the same set of processes that you use when you are trying to enhance flexibility and stretching.\\nSo I'd like to just take a moment and review the basic elements of nervous system, muscle, connective tissue and skeletal tissue, bone, that allow for flexibility and stretching.\\nAnd here we can point to two major mechanisms by which your nervous system, neurons, meaning nerve cells, communicate with muscles and those muscles communicate back to your nervous system to make sure that your limbs don't stretch too far, they don't move too far such that you get injured.\\nAnd in addition to that, mechanisms that ensure that you don't overload your muscles too much with weight or with tension or with effort and damage them that way.\\nBecause it turns out that the second security mechanism of making sure that you don't overload muscles can be leveraged toward increasing your flexibility almost immediately.\\nThat's right.\\nThere are protocols and tools that I'll share with you that are going to allow you to vastly improve your flexibility over time, but there are also mechanisms that allow you to quite significantly increase your degree of flexibility in a very short period of time within just a few seconds.\\nSo let's establish some of the basic biological mechanisms.\\nAnytime we talk about biology or physiology, we're going to talk about structure, meaning the cells and their connections and functions, what they do.\\nThey're just a few names to understand.\\nYou do not have to memorize these names.\\nThe important thing that I'd like you to know is that flexibility and the process of stretching and getting more flexible involves three major components.\\nNeural, meaning of the nervous system, muscular, muscles, and connective tissue.\\nConnective tissue is the stuff that surrounds the neural stuff and the muscular stuff, although it's all kind of weaved together and braided together in complicated ways.\\nSome of you may have heard of fascia.\\nWe're going to talk a little bit about fascia today, although it's such an interesting tissue that's really deserving of its own episode.\\nFacial tissue, we're going to talk about some of the stuff that surrounds muscles that really gives you your shape and holds everything together and allows for flexibility to occur.\\nSo here's a key thing that everyone should know, whether or not you're talking about flexibility or not.\\nYour nervous system controls your muscles.\\nIt's what gets your muscles to contract.\\nSo within your spinal cord, you have a category of neurons, nerve cells, that are called motor neurons.\\nTo be precise, they are lower motor neurons because they're in your spinal cord.\\nWe call them lower to distinguish them from the motor neurons that are in your brain up in your skull.\\nThose lower motor neurons, hereafter I'll just refer to them as motor neurons.\\nIf I want to talk about the other kind of motor neurons, I'll say upper motor neurons.\\nSo if I say motor neurons, I just mean the ones in your spinal cord.\\nThose motor neurons send a little wire or set of wires out to your muscles.\\nAnd that creates what's called a neuromuscular junction, which just means that the neurons meet the muscles at a particular place.\\nThose neurons release a chemical.\\nThat chemical is called acetylcholine.\\nSome of you may have heard about acetylcholine before.\\nAcetylcholine also exists in your brain and does other things in your brain.\\nMainly it's involved in focus and attention.\\nBut at the neuromuscular junction, the release of acetylcholine from these nerve cells, these neurons onto the muscles, causes the muscles to contract.\\nAnd when muscles contract, they are able to move limbs by way of changing the length of the muscle, adjusting the function of connective tissue like tendons and ligaments.\\nAnd for instance, if you're bringing your wrist closer to your shoulder, that biceps muscle is contracting.\\nIt's getting shorter.\\nI mean, in reality, it hasn't gotten shorter overall.\\nIt's just temporarily shorter, of course.\\nAll of that is controlled by neurons.\\nAnd it's those motor neurons from the spinal cord that are really responsible for the major movement of your limbs by way of causing contraction of specific muscles at specific times.\\nSo the key thing to take away is that nerve controls the contraction of muscles.\\nNow, within the muscles themselves, there are nerve connections.\\nAnd these are nerve connections that arise from a different set of neurons in the spinal cord that we call sensory neurons.\\nThe sensory neurons exist in a different part of the spinal cord, and they send a little wire or set of wires into the muscles.\\nAnd there's a particular kind of sensory neuron that comes out of your spinal cord and into your muscles, which are called spindle neurons.\\nThey create or they actually wrap around muscle fibers and corkscrew around them.\\nThey give kind of a spring-like appearance.\\nIf for you aficionados out there, these are intrafusal connections or neurons.\\nIntrafusal means within the muscle, but you really don't need to know that unless you're really curious about it, or you're going to become a neuroscientist or you're in medical school or something.\\nThese spindle connections within the muscle that wrap around the muscle fibers, sense the stretch of those muscle fibers.\\nSo now we have two parts to the system that I've described.\\nYou've got motor neurons that can cause muscles to contract and shorten, and we have these spindles within the muscles themselves that wrap around the muscle fibers.\\nAnd that information is sent from the muscle back to the spinal cord.\\nIt's a form of sensing what's going on in the muscle, much in the same way that you have neurons in your eye that sense light in your external environment.\\nYou have neurons in your ear that sense sound waves in your external environment.\\nYou have neurons in your spinal cord that are sensory neurons that are sensing the amount of stretch in the muscles.\\nWhat happens is if a given muscle is stretching really far, those sensory neurons, those spindles within the muscle will activate and will send a electrical potential, literally a bit of electricity along that wire's length into the spinal cord.\\nAnd then within the spinal cord, that sensory neuron communicates through a series of intermediate steps, but to the motor neuron and make sure that that motor neuron contracts.\\nNow, why would that be useful? Well, what this does is it creates a situation where if a muscle is stretching too much because the range of motion of a limb is increased too much, then the muscle will contract to bring that limb range of motion into a safe range again.\\nNow, what determines whether or not a range of motion is quote unquote safe or not is dictated by a number of things.\\nIt's dictated by things that are happening in this kind of loop of neural connections in the spinal cord and muscle.\\nIt's also determined by what's going on in your head, literally in your mind, cognitively, about whether or not the movement of that limb, its increasing range of motion is good for you, whether or not you're doing it deliberately, whether or not it's bad for you.\\nAnd then there are also some basic safety mechanisms that are put in there that really try and restrict our limb range of motion.\\nOkay, so just to clarify, this whole thing looks like a loop and the essential components of the loop are motor neurons contract muscles, sensory neurons of which there are a bunch of different varieties of in this case, what we're calling the spindles are sensing stretch within the muscles.\\nAnd if a given muscle is elongating because of the increased range of motion of a limb, those sensory neurons send an electrical signal into the spinal cord such that there is an activation of the motor neuron, which by now should make perfect sense as to why that's useful.\\nIt then shortens up the muscle.\\nIt actually doesn't really shorten the muscle, but contracts the muscle that brings the limb back into a safe range of motion.\\nOkay, so this process is very fast.\\nIt was designed to keep your body together and safe.\\nIt's designed to make sure that you don't take your arm and swing it behind your torso and it just goes all the way back to the middle of your back.\\nI mean, unless you're a contortionist, or you've trained that kind of level of flexibility, that would be terrible because it could provide a lot of damage to the muscles and to the connective tissue and so forth.\\nSo that's one basic mechanism that we want to hold in mind.\\nThis idea of a spindle that senses stretch and can activate contraction of the muscles and shorten the muscles.\\nThe next mechanism I want to describe, and once again, there are only two that you need to hold in mind for this episode.\\nThis other mechanism has a lot of the same features as the one I just described, but it has less to do with stretch.\\nIn fact, it doesn't have to do with stretch as much as it has to do with sensing loads.\\nSo at the end of each muscles, you have tendons typically, and there are neurons that are closely associated with those tendons that are called Golgi tendon organs.\\nThese are neurons that are sensory neurons that sense how much load is on a given muscle.\\nSo if you're lifting up something very, very heavy, these neurons are going to fire, meaning they're going to send electrical activity into the spinal cord.\\nAnd then those neurons have the ability to shut down, not activate, but shut down motor neurons and to prevent the contraction of a given muscle.\\nSo for instance, if you were to walk over and try and pick up a weight that is much too heavy for you, meaning you could not do it without injuring yourself and you start to try and heave that weight off the ground, there are a number of reasons why you might not be able to lift it.\\nBut let's say you start to get it a little bit off the ground or you start to get some force generated that would allow it to move.\\nBut the force that you're generating could potentially rip your muscles or your tendons off of the bone, right? That it could disrupt the joints and it could tear ligaments.\\nWell, you have a safety mechanism in place.\\nIt's these Golgi tendon organs, these GTOs as they're called, that get activated and shut down the motor neurons and make it impossible for those muscles to contract.\\nOkay, so on the one hand, we have a mechanism that senses stretch and can figure out when stretch is excessive.\\nAnd when the system detects that stretch is excessive, it activates the contraction of muscles.\\nAnd then we have a second mechanism that senses loads.\\nAnd when tension or loads is deemed excessive by these circuits, and remember these circuits don't have a mind, they don't go, oh, this is excessive.\\nThey just sense loads.\\nAnd when those loads exceed a certain threshold, well, then those GTOs, those Golgi tendon organs send signals into the spinal cord that shut down your motor neurons ability to contract muscles so that you no longer can lift that heavy load.\\nSo both of these are protective mechanisms, but both of these can be leveraged in a very logical way and in a very safe way in order to increase your limb range of motion.\\nSo there are a couple of things I want to point out before going a little bit further into how your nervous system controls flexibility and stretching.\\nAnd those key points are the following.\\nThere are now dozens, if not hundreds of studies that show that a dedicated stretching practice can improve limb range of motion.\\nNow, for many of you listening, you're probably saying duh, but I think it's important to point that out, that a dedicated stretching practice can increase limb range of motion.\\nAnd as you'll soon learn, there are specific mechanisms that can explain that effect.\\nThe second point is one of longevity.\\nAnd when I say longevity, I don't necessarily mean late stage aging.\\nWe all undergo a decrease in limb range of motion unless we do something to offset that decrease.\\nAnd the current numbers vary from study to study, but if you look en masse, you look at all of those studies, and what you basically find is that we start to experience a decrease in flexibility from about age 20 until about age 49, that's pretty dramatic.\\nAnd then of course it will continue after age 49.\\nBut basically it's a 10% decrease every 10 years.\\nSo we could say it's a 1% decrease per year, although it's not necessarily linear.\\nWhat do I mean by that? Well, it's not necessarily that on your 21st birthday, you are 1% less flexible than you were on your 20th birthday and it decreases by 1% per year.\\nSome of these changes can be non-linear.\\nSo you can imagine the person who's doing just fine in terms of flexibility between 20 and 30, and then, you know, they get to 32 and suddenly they've lost 5% of their flexibility.\\nNow, of course there will be a ton of lifestyle factors.\\nIf you're a regular practitioner of yoga, if you have a dedicated stretching practice, if you're doing other things to improve your muscle contractibility, so you're doing resistance training, it turns out, can actually indirectly improve flexibility.\\nThere are a number of different factors.\\nBut the key point is that maintaining some degree of flexibility and maybe even enhancing range of motion and flexibility is of immense benefit for offsetting injury provided it's not pushed too far.\\nThere are a number of people who have pushed their limb range of motion so far that they experience all sorts of injuries, both acute and chronic injuries.\\nToday, we'll also talk about how to avoid those scenarios.\\nOkay, so we've established that there are mechanisms within the spinal cord, muscles, and connective tissue.\\nRemember, it's the motor neurons, the spindles, the GTOs, and of course the muscles themselves, and connective tissue, tendons, but also other forms of connective tissue, that establish whether or not a limb is going to stay within a particular range of motion or not, and whether or not a limb is going to be allowed by the nervous system to pursue or handle a given load, a given tension.\\nThere are also mechanisms that arrive to the neuromuscular system from higher up in the nervous system, from the brain.\\nAnd those mechanisms involve a couple of different facets that are really interesting, and I think that we should all know about.\\nIn fact, today I'm going to teach you about a set of neurons that I'm guessing 99.9% of you have never heard of, including all you neuroscientists out there, if you're out there, and I know you're out there, that seem uniquely enriched in humans and probably perform essential roles in our ability to regulate our physiology and our emotional state.\\nSo within the brain, we have the ability to sense things in the external world, something we called exteroception, and we have the ability to sense things in our internal world within our body called interoception.\\nInteroception can be the volume of food in your gut, whether or not you're experiencing any organ pain or discomfort, whether or not you feel good in your gut and in your organs, that's actually kind of feeling, I feel great, I feel sated, I feel relaxed.\\nThose are all different forms of interoception.\\nThe main brain area that's associated with interpreting what's going on in our body is called the insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.\\nIt's a very interesting brain region.\\nIt's got two major parts.\\nThe front of it is mainly concerned with things like smell and to some extent, vision, and to some extent, other things that are arriving from the external world and combining with what's going on internally and making sense of all that, or at least routing that information elsewhere in your nervous system to make decision, like if you smell something good to approach it or if you smell something bad to avoid it.\\nThe front of the insula is really doing all of that kind of stuff, along with other brain areas.\\nThe posterior insula, the back of the insula, that is, has a very interesting and distinct set of functions.\\nThe posterior insula is mainly concerned with what's going on with your somatic experience.\\nHow do you feel internally? And how is the movement that you happen to be doing combining with your internal state to allow you to feel, as I like to say, the nervous system mainly batches things into yum, like, oh, this is really good for me, yuck, this is really bad for me, and I need to stop, or meh, this is kind of neutral, okay? So this isn't about food, but we could say for most stimuli, most senses, whether or not they're senses of things internally or externally, our nervous system is trying to make decisions about what to do with that information, and so it mainly batches information into yum, I want to keep doing this or approach this thing, or continue down some path of movement or eating or staying in a temperature environment, et cetera, or yuck, I need to get out of here, I don't want any more of this, I don't want to keep doing this, this is painful or aversive or stressful, and then meh, sorry if it doesn't really matter, I can just kind of stay right here or not, yum, yuck, and meh.\\nWell, in your posterior insula, you have a very interesting population of very large neurons, these are exceptionally large neurons, called van-economo neurons, these are neurons that are, again, unbeknownst to most neuroscientists, and they seem uniquely enriched in humans.\\nChimpanzees have them, and some other large animals have them, so they're found in whales, chimpanzees, elephants, and in humans, but even though we are much smaller than most whales, and even though we are much smaller than most elephants, I mean, remember there are baby elephants, as far as I know they haven't bred up like mini elephants yet, they seem to have a teacup version of pretty much every dog breed, you can look that up, I certainly have mixed feelings about this notion of trying to downsize everything to the point where you could kind of like, the pocket-sized bulldog I think someday will arrive, I'm not a fan of that kind of downsizing of different breeds, but because there aren't teacup elephants, and teacup gorillas, and teacup chimpanzees, and so forth, most all of those other species are larger than us, they have these van-economo neurons, and we have these van-economo neurons, but we have in upwards of 80,000 of these things in our posterior insula, these other species tend to have somewhere in the range of a thousand to maybe 10,000 or so, why is that interesting? Well, these van-economo neurons have the unique property of integrating our knowledge about our body movements, our sense of pain and discomfort, and can drive motivational processes that allow us to lean into discomfort, and indeed to overcome any discomfort, if we decide that the discomfort that we are experiencing is good for us or directed toward a specific goal.\\nThis knowledge turns out to be very important to keep in mind, because as we migrate this conversation toward the things that we can do to enhance flexibility in stretching, you'll soon learn that there are moments within a stretching protocol where you have the opportunity to either override pain and discomfort, to kind of relax through it or push through it, right? There's a decision fork in the road there, and I'll tell you which fork in the road to take, or to say, uh-uh, I'm not going to do that.\\nI'm going to allow these natural reflexes of the spindle to kick in and just essentially stop me from stretching if a given limb isn't designed or shouldn't be stretched that far.\\nSo I'd like you to keep these van-economo neurons in mind.\\nI should mention they're named van-economo because the guy, Constantine van-economo, that discovered them at the end of the 1800s, early 1900s, decided to name them after himself, as many scientists do, or certainly the neurologists and physicians are famous for naming things after themselves.\\nThese van-economo neurons turn out to be very important to keep in mind as we embark on our exploration of what sorts of stretching practices can be best applied to increase flexibility, because whether or not you undertake a mild, moderate, or intense flexibility training, you will no doubt encounter a scenario at some point where you will have to ask yourself, do I quote unquote, relax into this stretch, or do I try and push through just a little bit of discomfort? And I'll explain how to gauge that decision in a very specific and ideally safe way.\\nAnd I'll give you some tools that will allow you to make that decision in the way that best preserves the integrity of those neural circuits that I described earlier and can keep you safe.\\nThese van-economo neurons sit in the exact position that one would want to be able to evaluate what's going on in the body, in particular, what's going on in terms of limb movements, how that relates to our feelings of discomfort.\\nAnd then there's the other aspect of these van-economo neurons, which is that these van-economo neurons are connected to a number of different brain areas that can shift our internal state from one of so-called sympathetic activation.\\nSo this is a pattern of alertness and even stress, sometimes even panic, but typically alertness and stress, to one of so-called parasympathetic activation, to one of relaxation.\\nOftentimes you'll hear that stretching should be done by relaxing into the stretch.\\nWell, what does it actually mean to relax into the stretch? Well, these van-economo neurons sit at this junction where they're able to evaluate what's going on inside our body and allow us to access neural circuitries by which we can shift our relative level of alertness down a bit, or our relative level of stress down a bit, and thereby to increase so-called parasympathetic activation and to literally override some of those spindle mechanisms, even the GTO mechanisms, but especially the spindle mechanisms at the neuromuscular and muscular spinal junction.\\nAnd in that way, gently, subtly override the reflex that would otherwise cause us to contract those muscles back.\\nThe reason that's possible is because your brain has those other kinds of motor neurons, the upper motor neurons that can both direct, meaning control, and can override lower motor neurons.\\nI'll give you a brief example of this that you've already done in your life and that we all have the capacity for.\\nWhat I'm referring to is the monosynaptic stretch reflex.\\nThis is something that every first year neuroscience graduate student learns, which is that if you were to step on a sharp object with a bare foot, you would not need to make the decision to retract your foot.\\nYou would automatically do that, provided you have a healthy nervous system.\\nThere are mechanisms in place that cause the retraction of that limb by way of ensuring that the proper muscles contract and other muscles do not contract, in fact, that they fully relax, okay? So in the case of stepping on a sharp object, like a piece of glass or a nail or a tack, you would essentially activate the hip flexor to lift up your foot as quickly as possible.\\nIn doing so, that same neural circuit would activate a contralateral, meaning opposite side of the body circuit, to ensure that the leg, the foot, that's not stepping on the sharp object would do exactly the opposite and would extend to make sure that you don't fall over.\\nAll of that happens reflexively.\\nIt does not require any thought or decision-making.\\nIn fact, humans without any neocortex, literally who are decerebrate or an animal that doesn't have, and when I say decerebrate, I mean lack of cerebral cortex, they can perform that because it's all controlled by circuits that are basically below the brain and in the spinal cord.\\nThere's a little bit of activation of circuits in the kind of deeper parts of the brain, but basically you don't need to think or decide in order to do that.\\nHowever, if your life depended on walking across some sharp objects, let's say, let's make it a little less dramatic, so it's not like the Die Hard movie or something where he has to run barefoot across the glass, although that's a pretty good example of what I'm describing here, but let's say you had to walk across some very hot stones to get away from something that you wanted to avoid.\\nYou could override that stretch reflex by way of a decision made with your upper motor neurons, your insula and your cognition and almost certainly those van economy neurons, which would be screaming, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, could shuttle that information to brain areas that would allow you to override the reflex and essentially push through the pain.\\nAnd maybe even, in fact, even, not experience the pain to the same degree or even at all.\\nSo these van economy neurons sit at a very important junction within the brain.\\nThey pay attention to what's going on in your body, pain, pleasure, et cetera, and that includes what's going on with your limbs and your limb range of motion.\\nThey also are paying attention and can control the amount of activation, kind of alertness or calmness that you are able to create within your body in response to a given sensory experience.\\nAnd as I mentioned before, they seem to be uniquely enriched in humans.\\nThey seem to be related to the aspects of our evolution that allow us to make decisions about what to do with our body in ways that other animals just simply can't.\\nBefore we go any further, I want to give you a practical tool that you can of course use, but that will also give you insight and experience into your muscle spindle spinal cord circuit mechanisms.\\nSo what I'd like you to do is if you're in a proper place to do this, you're going to stand with legs straight, meaning knees not bent, and you're going to try and touch your toes, or for some of you, that's going to be very easy and you might even be able to put your hands flat on the floor.\\nI don't have that kind of flexibility.\\nIt's pretty easy for me to touch my toes.\\nI don't care if you round your back or not, although ideally I would say don't round your back, not because it's bad to do so necessarily, but just to try and keep this the same from trial to trial, as it were.\\nSo try and get a sense of what your range of motion is in terms of bending over at the waist while maintaining a flat back and trying to touch your toes or even touch the floor.\\nMaybe again, you can even go hands flat to the floor, maybe even far out in front of you.\\nOkay, now what I'd like you to do is stand back up and I'd like you to contract your quadriceps as hard as you possibly can for about five to 15 seconds, let's say 10 seconds, just to keep things more or less normalized.\\nThis obviously is not a super controlled experiment.\\nSo to contract your quadriceps, for those of you that don't know, you're going to extend your lower limb out.\\nSo this would be like kicking, although don't do it too quickly.\\nYou're going to kick out your foot.\\nYou should feel your quadriceps contract on the top of your thighs, and you're going to try and consciously contract them as hard as you can.\\nTypically, if you want to point your toe back towards your knee or shin, that's also going to help somewhat to contract even harder and harder.\\nSo do that for about 10 seconds.\\nA lot of you will do this just while standing, contract, contract, contract.\\nOkay, then release it.\\nAnd then now go ahead and repeat that stretch where you're trying to touch your toes or touch the floor.\\nSo this is again, relying more or less on hamstring flexibility among other things.\\nWhat most of you will find is that you have an immediate increase in hamstring flexibility or your range of motion has increased.\\nIf you didn't experience that, then I would encourage you to try and contract your quadriceps harder and longer.\\nSo maybe 20 or 30 seconds, and then try this so-called experiment again.\\nWhy would contracting your quadriceps allow your hamstring flexibility to suddenly increase? Well, the way that our muscles are organized is such that we have muscles that are antagonistic to one another.\\nSo our quadriceps and our hamstrings work in sort of a push-pull fashion, if you will.\\nThey can antagonize one another.\\nSo when you move your heel towards your glutes, you are using your hamstring.\\nThe hamstring obviously also does other things related to hip movement.\\nAnd when you lift your knee or when you extend your foot and contract your quadriceps, you are essentially relaxing the hamstrings.\\nNow, of course, most movements involve both the quadricep and hamstring in synchrony.\\nAnd that synchrony is really an elegant one.\\nBut here we're more or less isolating the quadriceps from the hamstrings, at least to the extent that it can leverage these spindle stretch mechanisms.\\nSo what happens is when you contract your quadriceps hard, you are relaxing or releasing some of the stretch that's occurring in those intrafusal spindle sensory fibers going into your spinal cord.\\nAnd as a consequence, you're able then to stretch your hamstrings further, or we can be more accurate and say that your range of motion about the hamstring and its related joints is greater when you aren't engaging that spindle reflex, which would cause the hamstrings to contract.\\nOkay, so if you are somebody who has tight hamstrings, there could be a variety of reasons for that.\\nBut part of the reason is likely to be neural, and you can release that neural spindle reflex by contracting the opposite antagonistic muscle, which in this case is the quadriceps.\\nThe same thing is true and can be leveraged for stretching other muscles.\\nSo for instance, if you're going to do a tricep stretch, the typical kind of overhead where you grab your elbow and move it toward the midline of your body with the other hand, using your opposite hand, well, you can do that.\\nAnd then I would suggest trying to flex your bicep, contract your bicep, that is, while doing that.\\nAnd for most people, you'll notice a increase in the tricep range of motion or ability to kind of lean into or to relax into or to push that stretch a little bit further.\\nNow, for you physios out there and for those of you that have backgrounds in kinesiology, I want to acknowledge, of course, there are other mechanisms that are coming into play.\\nThere are actually neural connections within the joints themselves that are providing proprioceptive feedback, et cetera, et cetera.\\nBut this is simply to illustrate that part of our range of motion is determined by the spindle mechanisms that I spent some time focusing on earlier.\\nAnd indeed, this approach can be leveraged toward creating increased limb range of motion, not just for the hamstrings, but for your quadriceps.\\nSo for instance, if you have tight quadriceps, you can do the opposite.\\nYou can contract your hamstring very intensely for let's say 10 seconds or 20 seconds or 30 seconds.\\nSo that would take some conscious effort of bringing your heel up towards your glutes.\\nYou could do that in a way that you're really trying to contract those muscles hard.\\nYou'd have to use some deliberate hamstring activation there, meaning you have to use those upper motor neurons and the other aspects of your upper brain power, as it were, to try and really contract your hamstrings as intensely as possible.\\nThen you would relax that, and then you would do your quadriceps stretch again.\\nAnd if you did a pre hamstring contraction measurement of your quadricep flexibility, and then you did a post hamstring contraction measure of your quadricep flexibility, almost certainly you would find that that flexibility had increased.\\nNow, of course, the muscle really didn't change much.\\nThe tendons didn't change much.\\nWhat changed was the patterns of neural activation that were restricting you from, in the first case, stretching your hamstring, or having a, to be more accurate, we should say, to having a certain range of motion about the hamstring and its related joints.\\nAnd those break mechanisms were removed.\\nAnd of course, then when you contract your hamstring, you're removing some of the neural breaks, the spindle acting as a break, and inhibiting that quadricep range of motion.\\nOkay, so you can imagine this, and in fact, you can apply this for any number of different muscles.\\nThe larger muscles and the sort of biceps, triceps, and hamstrings, quadriceps are sort of the simplest place to think about this and to apply it.\\nBut in theory, and indeed in practice, it really works for all the various muscle groups.\\nIt's just sometimes harder to access these so-called antagonistic muscle groups.\\nNow, we should take a moment and just discuss what actually happens as we get more flexible in the short-term and long-term.\\nI just mentioned what happens in the short-term.\\nClearly, those don't involve lengthening of the muscles.\\nIt's not like the muscles slide along the bones or that the tendons really stretch out that much more than they had prior to that kind of exercise.\\nBut it is the case that if people stretch consistently over a given period of several weeks or more, that there are changes in the muscles.\\nThis gets a little bit tricky in terms of nomenclature, and I just want to highlight that because I think that a number of people get frustrated and confused, in fact, when we talk about muscles getting longer.\\nThe whole concept of a muscle getting longer isn't really in keeping with reality, but there are elements within the muscles that can change their conformation.\\nSo to get a little bit detailed here, and we won't spend too much time on this, but I just want to acknowledge this for those of you that are interested in neuromuscular physiology and how it relates to flexibility.\\nYou have your muscle fibers, and then you have your so-called myofibrils.\\nSo you can imagine kind of a single fiber.\\nThat fiber, of course, will get input from those motor neurons.\\nAnd then within those fibers, you have what are called sarcomeres.\\nAnd you can kind of think about sarcomeres as little segments, kind of like the segments of bamboo.\\nIf you ever look at bamboo, it's not just one big stalk.\\nIt's got those little out pouchings along the way that kind of break up what would be just one big stalk of bamboo into different segments.\\nBut they're all connected.\\nThe sarcomeres are somewhat like that.\\nAnd within the sarcomeres, you have a couple of different components.\\nOne thing is called myosin, which is like a thick layer, and then the other is actin.\\nAnd those are interdigitated, as we say.\\nThey're kind of connected to one another, kind of like if you were to put your fingers together from your two hands, if you were going to put your fingers in between one another, that's interdigitated, literally interdigitated in this case, so pun intended.\\nAnd that myosin and actin kind of move relative to one another, and they have a lot to do with your ability to contract muscles.\\nWhen we stretch muscles, when we go through a stretching practice, there are a number of things that change, some neural, some related directly to connective tissue, but also it appears from really nice work, mainly done from McGill University.\\nI'll provide a link to a couple of these studies if you want to dig in there more deeply, that change the confirmation, the relative size and spacing of some of these things like sarcomeres and the way that myosin and actin kind of work together.\\nBut we don't want to think of muscles as lengthening.\\nWe can, however, think about the resting state of a muscle being slightly different, or indeed very different, than the resting state of a muscle of somebody or of a limb that has not undergone regular flexibility training.\\nSo that's as much time as I want to spend on that, because we could spend an entire hour getting right down into the details.\\nBut I do want to emphasize, however, that muscles have different parts.\\nThey have fibers, they have sarcomeres, they have myosin, they have actin.\\nBut the idea of making our muscles longer, that reflects a number of processes that occur basically within an existing muscle length.\\nThe length of our muscle bellies and where our insertions are relative to our connective tissue in our limbs is genetically determined, right? Some people have, for instance, a bicep that goes all the way from the crook of their elbow up to their shoulder, right? And some people can, you know, if they were to put their arm at a 90 degree angle, could put two or three fingers between their bicep and their elbow.\\nThey have a, we can say, a shorter bicep, relatively shorter.\\nNow, the reason I mention these highly detailed cellular mechanisms is because as we start to embark on different protocols for using stretching to increase flexibility and range of motion, we need to ask ourselves, what is preventing our ability to extend range of motion? Is it the spindle, right? Is it because the muscle is stretching too much? Oftentimes it can be because of that and or because of a sense of pain or simply a sense that the muscle is not in a position that it's been in before, that's unrelated to pain or to spindle activation.\\nAnd oftentimes it can be related directly to these changes in the confirmation of myosin and actin and within the context of the sarcomeres.\\nNow, of course, you can't peer into or sense your individual sarcomeres.\\nHowever, you do have neurons that innervate these areas and that send that sensory information back into the spinal cord and up to your brain to interpret.\\nSo you'll find that as we move along, there are specific adjustments that you can make at both the macro level, meaning how much movement to insert into your stretching, right, is it going to be a static or dynamic or even a ballistic stretch? Or for instance, at the micro level, that even just a slight sub-millimeter or millimeter increase in the stretching of a given muscle and it related tissues can translate into an increased range of motion performance.\\nAs a quick but relevant aside, I thought I'd share with you something useful that's also grounded in this notion of antagonistic muscles.\\nSo for those of you that do resistance training, whether or not it's with body weight or with physical weights or machines, what have you, you may have found that if you, let's say we're to do three sets of a pushing exercise.\\nSo this could be push-ups, this could be bench presses, this could be shoulder presses, something of that sort.\\nAnd then later in the workout, you were to do, let's say machine pull-downs or pull-ups or chin-ups of some sort, so a pulling exercise.\\nTypically what you would find is if you were to do what's often called straight sets, so you would do three sets of push-ups, let's say with two minutes of rest in between, that you might be able to get a certain number of repetitions on the first set.\\nJust for sake of example, let's say you can get 10 repetitions on the first set and then you get eight repetitions on the second set and then you get six repetitions on the third set with two minutes in between.\\nAnd then you would move on at some point to your pulling exercises and similarly, let's say you were doing chin-ups or pull-downs and you would get 10 repetitions, rest two minutes, eight repetitions, rest two minutes and six repetitions.\\nOkay, fine.\\nWell, typically what people discover is that if they interleave their pushing and pulling exercises, provided they do that for muscles that are antagonistic to one another.\\nSo in this case, pushing with the chest, shoulders and triceps for the pushing exercises and pulling with the back and biceps and of course there are other muscles involved as well.\\nBut because those muscle groups are at least in part antagonistic to one another, what people often find is that if they were to say, do their pushing set, get 10 repetitions, then move to a pulling set after just say 60 seconds and perform that pulling set, then go back to the pushing set, then go back to a pulling set, push, pull, push, pull.\\nIn other words, interleaving their sets, even if they were to maintain the same amount of rest between sets of pushing and sets of pulling, what they discover often is that the drop in the number of repetitions that they get is somewhat offset.\\nSo rather than get 10, eight, six, as it were with the straight sets, it will be 10, nine, eight.\\nSo what this means is not that you're increasing the total rest time to four minutes between sets because then of course it wouldn't be equivalent, but rather that while maintaining the same amount of rest between sets for this same muscle group, by going from push, pull, push, pull of antagonistic muscles, you're able to have improved performance.\\nAnd the reason for that has everything to do with what we were describing before, which is that typically if you were to do push, set, rest, push, set, rest, push, set, rest, well, in between those sets and in fact, actually during those sets of pushing, the pulling muscles that would be involved in the chin ups or pull downs, et cetera, are actually relaxing or at least are being released of some tension, including the activation of the spindles among other things.\\nSo that's a long-winded way of saying the interleaving push and pull of antagonistic sets can leverage some of the same neural circuits that we're talking about leveraging for sake of increasing flexibility.\\nNow, I offer this to you as a tool that you can try.\\nOne of the challenges with using this tool, however, is that you often have to occupy multiple sites within the gym.\\nIf you're doing this at home and you have your own gym, that's one thing.\\nIf you're doing this in a gym where you have multiple pieces of equipment, well, then you become that person who has essentially taken over some small corner or multiple corners or machines within the gym.\\nAnd oftentimes you'll find that you'll walk back to a machine or you'll walk back to a given resistance exercise and someone has now taken it over and the whole thing can be thrown off.\\nSo it takes a little bit of orchestrating in order to do properly, but in general, what people find is that this can allow you to enhance performance overall of these individual movements, again, while maintaining the same amount of rest.\\nAnd even if you choose not to do this, I encourage you to pay attention to this as a concept because again, it's leveraging this idea of antagonistic muscles, flexors and extensors, antagonistic neural relationships between the spinal cord mechanisms that control one set of muscles and activating those muscles, allowing the opposite antagonistic muscle to relax and therefore to perform better on its next set.\\nSo now I'd like to shift to the question of what types of stretching can and should we do to increase limb range of motion? If our goal is to do that in the most efficient way possible because I realized that most people don't have endless amounts of time to dedicate to a stretching practice and even for those of us that do, I'm sure that you want to get the most outcome for a given effort.\\nAnd what are the modes of stretching that are going to allow us to increase our flexibility and limb range of motion most safely? Now, there are a number of different types of stretching or methods of stretching.\\nBroadly defined, we can describe these as dynamic, ballistic, static, and what's called PNF stretching.\\nPNF stands for proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation and it involves and leverages many of the mechanisms that I described to you earlier.\\nThe first two that I mentioned, dynamic and ballistic stretching, both involve some degree of momentum and can be distinguished from static and PNF type stretching.\\nNow, to distinguish dynamic stretching from ballistic stretching, like to focus on this element of momentum.\\nBoth involve moving a limb through a given range of motion.\\nIn dynamic stretching, however, it tends to be more controlled, less use of momentum, especially towards the end range of motion.\\nWhereas in ballistic stretching, there tends to be a bit more swinging of the limb or use of momentum.\\nSo I invite you to visualize what dynamic and ballistic stretching might look like in your mind.\\nYou can even try it if it's safe for you to try it.\\nYou could imagine swinging your arm up overhead as much as possible and bringing it down.\\nI'm doing this because I'm seated.\\nIt's kind of ridiculous movement to do while seated or perhaps at all.\\nBut for instance, you can see dynamic and ballistic stretching anytime someone, for instance, is holding onto something with one arm or maybe not holding on and swinging out their foot.\\nSo essentially getting movement about the hip joint.\\nAnd you'll notice that some people raise it up and pause it and bring it down.\\nThat's one form of dynamic stretching.\\nWhereas others will swing it up and sort of let it carry itself a bit further, do the momentum at the top of the movement and then just let it drop back down or maybe even control the descent.\\nThere is an enormous range of parameter space here or variables that one could imagine.\\nAnd there's just simply no way that we could subdivide all those.\\nBut again, dynamic and ballistic stretching both involve movement.\\nSo we have to generate some force in order to create that movement.\\nBallistic stretching involving a bit more momentum or sometimes a lot more momentum, especially at the end range of motion.\\nNow, both of those are highly distinct from static stretching, which involves holding the end range of motion.\\nSo minimizing the amount of momentum that's used.\\nSo to stay with a simple example that we are all now familiar with from our earlier discussion, slowly bending over at the waist and trying to touch your toes or putting your hands to the floor and then holding that end position before coming up in a slow and controlled way such that you reduce the amount of momentum to near zero would be one example of static stretching.\\nStatic stretching can be further subdivided into active or passive, right? There are different names for these kinds of approaches.\\nYou can hear about the Anderson approach or the Janda approach.\\nYou can look these sorts of things up online.\\nAnd again, people tend to name things after themselves.\\nSo some of these are proprietary related to specific programs.\\nI'm not focusing on those.\\nOthers come to be named after the physiologists or the practitioners that initially popularize them.\\nAs is always the case, there's always a naming and renaming and claiming of territory with these things.\\nFor the time being, I'd like to just emphasize that static stretching can be both active where there's a dedicated effort on the part of the stretcher, you, to put force behind the hold to kind of extend or literally to extend the range of motion.\\nAnd then there's also passive static stretching in which it's more of a relaxation into a further range of motion.\\nAnd that can be a subtle distinction.\\nAnd there are other ways in which we can further distinguish active and passive static stretching.\\nBut nonetheless, static stretching involves both those types of elements, active and passive, but is really about eliminating momentum.\\nAnd then there's the PNF, the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation.\\nAnd proprioception has several different meanings in the context of neuroscience and physiology to just keep it really simple for today.\\nProprioception involves both a knowledge and understanding of where our limbs are in space and relative to our body, typically relative to the midline.\\nSo the brain is often trying to figure out where are our limbs relative to our midline down the center of our body.\\nAnd we know where our limbs are based on so-called proprioceptive feedback.\\nSo that's feedback that comes from sensory neurons, right? Now you know what sensory neurons that are essentially monitoring or responding to events within the joints, the connective tissue and the muscles, and within the deep components of the muscles, like the spindle reflex and within the tendons like the GTO, the Golgi tendon organ.\\nSo PNF type stretching leverages these sorts of mechanisms, these neural circuits by way of, for instance, you would lie on your back.\\nAnd if your goal is to increase your hamstring flexibility and the flexibility and range of motion of other related muscle systems, you might put a strap around your ankle and pull that muscle, or I should say, excuse me, that limb towards you.\\nYou're not going to pull the muscle towards you.\\nYou're going to pull that limb, your ankle, towards you to try and get it sort of back over your head and then progressively relaxing into that, or maybe even putting some additional force to push the end range of motion and then relaxing it, and then actually trying to stretch that same limb or increase the limb range of motion without the strap, right? Sometimes these are assisted by other people.\\nSo people will even use loads.\\nSometimes they'll even use machines.\\nThere are a number of different apparatus that have been designed for this.\\nSometimes it'll involve a training partner.\\nThere's a huge range of PNF protocols and those protocols can be done both by oneself with or without straps, with machines, with actual weights or with training partners.\\nIf you're interested in the variation of exercises to say target your hamstrings versus your quadriceps versus your shoulders versus your chest muscles, et cetera, your neck muscles and so on, there is an enormous range of information on dynamic, ballistic, static, and PNF stretches for all the various muscle groups.\\nAnd I should say there are some excellent books on those topics.\\nThere are also some excellent videos on YouTube and elsewhere.\\nNowadays, it's pretty easy to find exercises that allow you to target specific muscle groups and I encourage you to be safe in how you approach this and I would encourage you also to pay attention to the information that soon follows as to what sorts of protocols one would use to apply those exercises.\\nBut the number of exercises and the availability of those exercises for targeting different muscle groups with these four different kinds of stretching is both immense and fortunately, thankfully, immediately accessible to all of us, often at zero cost.\\nSo specific exercises to target specific muscle groups aside, we've now established that there are four major categories of stretching or at least those are the four major categories I'm defining today.\\nAnd we can further divide those categories into which are the ones that are going to be most effective for increasing range of motion in the long-term, not just in one individual session.\\nAnd there've been a number of studies exploring this.\\nI can list out at least four and we'll put those four as a kind of a cluster under one heading in the show note captions that arrive at essentially the same answer, which is that for increasing limb range of motion, it does appear that static type, including PNF, but static type stretching is going to be more effective than dynamic and ballistic stretching.\\nSo at least to my mind, this is good news.\\nWhy is it good news to me? Well, while dynamic and ballistic stretching can be immensely useful for improving performance of specific movements, in particular in the context of particular sports like tennis or in sprinting or frankly for any sport, they do carry with them a certain amount of risk because of the use of momentum.\\nSo you don't need to be highly trained in order to perform them.\\nIn fact, there is a place and we will describe when one would want to apply dynamic or ballistic stretching.\\nI'll just give away for now.\\nI think that most physios out there and certainly the ones that I spoke to, Dr. Andy Galpin, Dr. Kelly Starrett and a few others point to the fact that doing some safe dynamic and ballistic stretching prior to say a resistance training session or maybe even prior to a cardiovascular training session can be useful, both in terms of range of motion effects and in terms of neural activation effects.\\nI don't want to use the words warm up because warming up is typically associated with increasing core body temperature as it should be, but for engaging the neural circuits and becoming familiarized with the neural circuits that you're about to use in other movements while also increasing the range of motion of the joints involved in those movements so that you can perform them more safely and more confidently.\\nSo I'm certainly not saying, I want to repeat, I'm certainly not saying that dynamic and ballistic stretching are not useful.\\nThey absolutely are.\\nBut in terms of increasing limb range of motion in the longterm of truly becoming more flexible as opposed to transiently more flexible, static stretching, which includes PNF appears to be the best route to go.\\nSo if your goal is to increase your limb range of motion for a given muscle group or perhaps for all muscle groups, although you can imagine that'd be pretty tough.\\nI mean, you're not going to spend time, I could imagine working on your tongue muscle control or neck muscle control and every muscle control, but most of us want to reduce so-called tightness in air quotes and increase limb range of motion for certain muscle groups.\\nAnd it appears that the best way to do that is going to be static stretching of some kind, which raises the question of how often to do that static stretching and how long to hold those static stretches.\\nAnd we can also ask the question, we should ask the question, where to hold those static stretches? Is it always a good idea to hold those static stretches at the end or the point of maximal range of motion? We're going to address that now.\\nThere's some terrific science around this.\\nA slightly older study, but nonetheless, a powerful one, because it provided a foundation for a lot of subsequent work, which basically served to just confirm the answer they got here, is a study from Bandy et al.\\nAnd the title of this study is the effect of time and frequency of static stretching on the flexibility of the hamstring muscles.\\nIt was a study involving 93 subjects.\\nSo 61 men, 32 women, ranging in age from 21 to 39 years.\\nSo a pretty broad demographic who had limited hamstring muscle flexibility, here I'm paraphrasing, and randomly assigned to one of five groups.\\nSo the four stretching groups stretched five days per week for six weeks.\\nThe fifth group, which served as a control, did not stretch.\\nThe results clearly show that, quote, the change in flexibility appeared to be dependent on the duration and frequency of stretching.\\nThis is great.\\nThis tells us that stretching for a given amount of time scales with the amount of limb range of motion improvement that one will see.\\nThere were many interesting findings within this study, but the one that I'd like to highlight most is, quote, the results of this study suggest that a 30-second duration is an effective amount of time to sustain a hamstring muscle stretch in order to increase range of motion.\\nNo increase in flexibility occurred when the duration of stretching was increased from 30 seconds to 60 seconds, or when the frequency of stretching was increased from one to three times per day.\\nOkay, so now we're starting to lay down some parameters.\\nWhat this study reveals and what subsequent studies tell us, and we will get into those subsequent studies, is that ideally one would do static stretches that are held for 30 seconds, perhaps more in certain instances, and I'll explain when that can be useful, but here, holding those stretches for more than 30 seconds did not turn out to be additionally useful.\\nSo if you're going to stretch your quadricep, for instance, and you're going to hold that stretch in static fashion, remember, not using momentum, and you can use the mental tricks of either trying to push through the pain, which I don't recommend necessarily.\\nI think that makes us prone to injury, or to relax into the stretch, but nonetheless, providing some force, typically with a hand in order to pull your ankle back.\\nIf you're doing a quadricep stretch, some people might do this on the edge of a sofa.\\nRemember, there are a lot of different exercises and ways to do this that you can explore elsewhere.\\nWell, holding that static stretch for 30 seconds appears to be sufficient to stimulate an increase in limb range of motion over time.\\nAgain, these are protocols that were used repeatedly over time, and we'll talk about how often to repeat them in order to get maximal effect.\\nBut 30 second holds for static stretches is the number that I think we want to focus on, and that most of us are going to want to utilize.\\nSo now let's explore how many sets of static stretching one ought to do in order to get a maximum range of motion improvement while not placing us into a system that's going to create injury, nor a situation where we have to be constantly stretching throughout the day, because again, most of us don't have time to do that.\\nThis issue of sets is an important one.\\nIn the context of cardiovascular exercise, we've talked about the data that support the fact that doing at least 150, and ideally as much as 200 minutes per week of zone two cardiovascular exercise is very useful for cardiovascular health and for other aspects of health.\\nAnd of course, there are other aspects of cardiovascular exercise that can be layered onto and into that that can be useful, like 90 second maximal sprints, et cetera.\\nDiscussed this a lot in the episode with Dr. Andy Galpin and on our episode about endurance.\\nAnd we also talked about sets in the context of strength and hypertrophy building, building muscle size and or strength in the episode about that, and in particular in the episode with Dr. Andy Galpin.\\nAnd there we could also arrive at some specific parameters and it's going to vary, of course, between individuals, depending on how hard you train, whether or not you take sets to failure, your repetition range, et cetera.\\nBut in the context of strength and hypertrophy building, we arrived at a approximately six, maybe as many as 10 sets per week per muscle group.\\nSome of that work is done as direct work to a given muscle group.\\nSome of that work is indirect.\\nSo doing certain pulling exercise, of course, will target the latissimus dorsi muscles, but also the biceps.\\nSo if you, that doesn't necessarily mean you have to do 10 sets for the biceps and for the lats.\\nSometimes you're getting some indirect work, et cetera.\\nAll of that was delineated in the episode with Dr. Andy Galpin.\\nAnd we arrived at those numbers of sets according to the same criteria that we will apply here.\\nWhat is the minimum number of sets both to maintain and to improve a given mode of performance? Strength and hypertrophy or cardiovascular health.\\nAgain, to either maintain or improve.\\nAnd we can do the same thing for improving or maintaining range of motion.\\nBecause as I mentioned earlier, the data point to the fact that if we don't do some dedicated work to improve range of motion over time, we will lose our flexibility and limb range of motion over time.\\nJust by virtue of the fact that we're not doing anything to offset that.\\nSo whether or not you want to maintain, reestablish or gain limb range of motion, static stretching of holds of 30 seconds appear to be best.\\nNow the question is, how long should you do that? And how many sets should you do that? And how many times a week should you do that? To answer those questions, I'm going to turn to what I think is a really spectacular review.\\nThis was a review that was published in the year 2018.\\nSo it's fairly recent.\\nFirst author, Thomas Erwin Thomas, last author, Palma.\\nWe will put a link to this in the show note caption.\\nThe title of the paper is the relation between stretching typology and stretching duration, the effects on range of motion.\\nIt's a very straightforward title.\\nThis is a review article that explored a number of different studies.\\nHad criteria for whether or not those studies could be evaluated in the context of the questions here, had some quality standards and some other standards that they applied.\\nAnd basically, windowed down a large collection of studies to a remaining 23 articles that were able to be considered quote, eligible and included in the quantitative synthesis done here.\\nSo key points from that quantification and synthesis done in this paper.\\nFirst of all, and I quote, all stretching typologies showed range of motion improvements over a long-term period.\\nHowever, the static protocols showed significant gains with a P value less than 0.05, which means a probability that cannot be explained by chance alone when compared to ballistic or PNF protocols.\\nSo again, what we're hearing is that static stretching is the preferred mode for increasing limb range of motion.\\nAlthough here they make the additional point that static stretching might even be superior, not just to ballistic stretching, but also to PNF protocols.\\nBecause before, as you may recall, there was a distinction between ballistic and dynamic and static and PNF.\\nAnd so here it appears again that static stretching is sort of rising to the top of the list as the optimal approach relative to all other stretching approaches, at least in the context of increasing limb range of motion.\\nThe authors go on to say, time spent stretching per week seems fundamental to elicit range of movement improvements when stretches are applied for at least or more than five minutes per week.\\nOkay, this is critical.\\nThis is not five minutes per stretch.\\nRemember, 30 seconds per static stretch, but at least five minutes per week.\\nWhereas the time spent stretching within a single session does not seem to have a significant effects for range of motion gains.\\nIf this is getting confusing, I'll make sure that you soon understand exactly what we can export from these conclusions.\\nThe data indicate that performing stretching at least five days a week.\\nNow, some of you may already be groaning for at least five minutes per week.\\nOkay, so five days per week, that's a lot, but at least five minutes per week, five minutes per week is not that much.\\nUsing static stretching may be beneficial to promote range of motion improvements.\\nOkay, I've read this study in detail now.\\nThey highlight, again, the reduction in flexibility that occurs from 20 to 49 years of age and so on, how acute bouts of short-term stretching up to three weeks can improve stretch tolerance.\\nI think that's a key point that in the short term, the first three weeks of embarking on a stretching and flexibility program, much of the improvements come from the short-term neural improvements that we talked about before of inhibiting the spindle reflex and so on, and also a stretch tolerance, a comfort with doing the movements, and maybe even a comfort in overriding some of the pain mechanisms.\\nI'll talk a little bit more about that in just a bit, and the particular utility of yoga, something that I don't often practice, but that after reading this article that I'll mention in a little bit, I'm considering perhaps taking up some form of yoga protocol.\\nNow, I've already highlighted some of the key takeaways from the study, namely that we need to get at least five minutes per week of static stretching per muscle group, and based on the previous paper that we talked about, we need to divide that five minutes into sets of 30 seconds each.\\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, it doesn't seem to be the case that you can do all of that in one day, unfortunately.\\nIt does seem important that the frequency of stretching practice distributed throughout the week is important.\\nSo let's talk protocols.\\nWe are now talking about doing static stretching, so holding, so limiting momentum, and holding a stretch for 30 seconds per set.\\nWe're talking about trying to achieve five minutes per week of those static holds, but that we can't do it all in one session because the frequency of sessions distributed throughout the week correlates with the improvements in limb range of motion.\\nSo what this means is that we should probably be doing anywhere from two to four sets of 30 second static hold stretches five days a week, or some variant thereof.\\nAnd I do say some variant thereof because it turns out that even though there was that earlier study that we talked about, that holding a stretch for more than 30 seconds, in that case, 60 seconds, didn't turn out to be additionally beneficial.\\nIt appears that if you do hold those stretches for 60 seconds per static stretching set, for instance, you can get away with stretching fewer days per week overall.\\nSo in order to make this as clear as possible, because I do realize there are a lot of parameters, and you might be asking, why didn't you just make me a list of the exact things I should do? Well, it doesn't work that way because once you understand the mechanisms and once you understand your particular goals, this information is designed for you to be able to construct a stretching program that is tailored to your specific goals.\\nIf I just gave you the stretching program that I'm doing, or I should say that I'm soon to be doing, because I'm soon to be doing one based on the research for this particular episode, well, that wouldn't be beneficial for you.\\nBecause for instance, if you have very flexible hamstrings, but not very flexible quadriceps, or you are somebody who is engaged in sport or not engaged in sport, what you need to do is going to vary somewhat.\\nSo what would effective stretching protocol look like? We're all trying to improve limb range of motion for different limbs and different muscle groups.\\nBut just by way of example, and that's because the one we've been using, let's talk about hamstrings for the time being.\\nThis could of course be applied to other muscle groups.\\nLet's say you want to improve hamstring flexibility and limb range of motion about and around the hamstring and involving the hamstring.\\nYou would want to do three sets of static stretching for the hamstring.\\nAgain, easy to find such exercises on the internet.\\nYou would do that by holding the stretch for 30 seconds, resting some period of time, then doing it again, holding for 30 seconds, resting some period of time, and then holding it for 30 seconds.\\nThat would be one training session for the hamstrings.\\nI have to imagine that you'd probably want to stretch other muscle groups as well in that same session.\\nAlthough at least as far as I could tell, there were no data pointing to the fact that you couldn't do your hamstring stretching one part of the day and your quadriceps stretching another part of the day.\\nBut presumably you're going to want to combine your flexibility training into one single session.\\nSo three sets of 30 seconds each get 90 seconds.\\nAnd you would do that ideally five times a week or maybe even more, because it does seem like frequency distributed throughout the week is an important parameter.\\nNow, one thing that we have not highlighted or at least described is how long to rest between stretching sets.\\nAnd despite my efforts, I could not find research back information that pointed to whether or not 30 seconds of rest for every 30 second stretching or 60 seconds rest for every 30 second stretching was ideal.\\nI think it's reasonable to assume that doubling the amount of time for the interleaving rest would be appropriate or at least doable.\\nIf anyone out there has knowledge about rest between stretching sets and has some physiology or some biology or some experiential information as to why a given ratio of duration of static stretch to rest in between static stretch sets ought to be used.\\nPlease put it in the comments on YouTube.\\nThat'd be a terrific way for us to get that information.\\nI'd love to do any follow-up to links that you provide and so on.\\nBut now we're starting to build into a protocol that is backed by the scientific data.\\nThree sets of 30 seconds of holds done five times or maybe even six times per week.\\nOne thing that did show up in my exploration of the peer-reviewed research is this notion of warming up for all this.\\nWe haven't talked about that yet.\\nIn general, to avoid injury, it's a good idea to raise your core body temperature a bit before doing these kinds of stretches, even these static stretches, which we can sort of ease into and don't involve ballistic movement by definition.\\nAnd the basic takeaway that I was able to find was that if we are already warm from running or from weight training or from some other activity, that doing the static stretching practice at the end of that weight training or cardiovascular or other physical session would allow us to go immediately into the stretching session because we're already warm, so to speak.\\nOtherwise raising one's core body temperature by a bit by doing five to seven, maybe even 10 minutes of easy cardiovascular exercise or calisthenic movements provided you can do those without getting injured.\\nSeems to be an ideal way to warm up the body for stretching.\\nWe should be warm or warm up to stretch, although those warmups don't have to be extremely extensive.\\nAnd then just by way of logic, doing the static stretching after resistance training or cardiovascular training seems to be most beneficial.\\nIn fact, and unfortunately we don't have time to go into this in too much detail today.\\nI was able to find a number of papers that make the argument that static stretching prior to cardiovascular training and maybe even prior to resistance training can limit our performance in running and resistance training.\\nI realize that's a controversial area.\\nYou have those who say, no, it's immensely beneficial.\\nYou have those who say, no, it inhibits performance.\\nAnd those that say, no, it's a matter of how exactly you perform that static stretching and which muscle groups and how you're doing this and how much time in between static stretching and performance.\\nBut to leave all that aside, doing static stretching after some other form of exercise.\\nAnd if not after some form of exercise, after a brief warmup to raise your core body temperature, definitely seems like the right way to go.\\nNow for some of you out there, and I confess for me as well, doing something five days a week seems like a big commitment, even if that commitment is one to only do three sets of 30 second static stretches.\\nI say this because you've got the warmup.\\nI generally like to bring a kind of a focus and dedication to a practice.\\nAnd of course, because when doing these kinds of protocols, it's likely that you're not just stretching your hamstrings.\\nSo it's not just 90 seconds of work with a minute of rest in between, but very likely that we're also doing quadriceps stretching and also doing stretching for the shoulders and stretching for the back and the neck and so on.\\nAnd so that entire session is going to take some time.\\nAnd five days a week is a pretty serious commitment for most, especially for those of us that don't exercise or do athletics for a living, which I don't.\\nSo there is some evidence from the literature that one can get away with, or I don't even know that we should think about it as getting away with, but that one can do longer hold static stretches of up to say 60 seconds, but do fewer total sessions per week.\\nSo rather than three 30 second static holds, doing three 60 second static holds and doing those every other day.\\nAnd there really hasn't been a systematic exploration of this, the article that I was referring to just a few moments ago, this analysis of the 23 articles was combined into this enormous set of tables and some really quite nice graphs that you're welcome to look at since we're going to provide a link to the study.\\nThere are a couple of key takeaways that I want to mention that are separate from this issue of how long to stretch and how often.\\nFirst of all, they describe in their discussion that there were improvements in range of motion independent of whether or not people did static stretching, active stretching, passive stretching, ballistic stretching, or PNF stretching.\\nSo all of those forms of stretching will improve limb range of motion.\\nThis is essential to point out, and I want to emphasize this.\\nStatic stretching, however, gave the greatest degree of gains in limb range of motion.\\nAnd on average, they saw a 20.9% increase, but some of the other increases they observed were also quite substantial.\\nSo ballistic stretching can also provide some pretty impressive limb range of motion improvements.\\nHowever, they tended to be in the range of, here they point out 11.65% increase, or in the case of PNF, a 15% increase.\\nSo it appears that the greatest improvements in limb range of motion for your time spent and effort spent is going to be this minimum of five minutes per week to elicit a significant response with five days being the minimum weekly recommended frequency to achieve significant range of motion improvements.\\nI confess this was pretty surprising to me when I compare flexibility training to say, resistance training for strength and hypertrophy.\\nI've had the experience, and I know that other people have the experience, and I think Dr. Andy Galpin would probably agree that provided one trains hard enough and appropriately that you don't need to train resistance training five days a week in order to get significant improvements in strength and hypertrophy.\\nSome people might need to, but you can get a lot of positive results in those variables with less frequent training, certainly with three or four days a week of training.\\nAnd for cardiovascular training, I'm not aware of anyone having tested whether or not one very long run each week can actually increase cardiovascular fitness and you're not doing anything else.\\nAlthough I have to imagine you'd probably see some improvement compared to not doing anything.\\nBut most people are doing repeated training sessions of cardiovascular strength training.\\nNot a lot of people are doing five days a week of strength training, at least that I'm aware of.\\nSome people are, but most people I think are not.\\nAnd some people are doing five or more days a week of cardiovascular training.\\nI'm guessing that most people are not doing five days a week of dedicated static stretch, range of motion directed training.\\nBut it does appear that that frequency about the week, getting those repeated sessions, even if they are short for an individual muscle group, turns out to be important.\\nAnd so that points to the, perhaps the reason why so few people are doing dedicated range of motion work.\\nBut it also reminds me that all of the studies that were described, at least in this review, and some of the other ones that were not, really show impressive changes in limb range of motion.\\nI mean, 20 plus percent, or even 15% with PNF.\\nI mean, these are big changes that are going to benefit us.\\nThey're going to offset the age-related losses in flexibility for sure, if one is dedicated about these practices.\\nAnd in many cases, they're going to increase limb range of motion in ways that are going to allow us better performance in certain physical endeavors, certainly better balance, or we haven't really talked about balance and stability, but range of motion can impair balance and stability in some extreme circumstances, but by and large, limb range of motion, lack of tightness, improved posture, improved physical performance, excuse me, and things of that sort is something that I think we can all benefit from, and that are key features of longevity.\\nWe don't often think of them because we so prioritize cardiovascular health and the relationship between the heart and brain health and resistance training and musculoskeletal hypertrophy or strength, et cetera.\\nBut as I delved into this literature, it really highlighted for me the extent to which having really good limb range of motion, at least maintaining limb range of motion as we age from year to year, and maybe even improving limb range of motion can be immensely beneficial for reducing pain, for, again, improving posture, improving our ability to perform, to walk, et cetera.\\nAnd indeed, there's a whole literature that relates our limb range of motion to things like pain management of things related to headache and so on and so forth.\\nSo limb range of motion is not just about becoming a contortionist or being able to complete the yoga class.\\nIt really is about maintaining the integrity and the health of the neuromuscular system, the connective tissue, and the neuromuscular connective network, because those are indeed working as an ecosystem and a network.\\nI'd like to just briefly touch on PNF stretching for a moment.\\nAgain, this is a vast landscape with many parameters and different practitioners, a lot of competing opinions out there, to put it lightly.\\nNonetheless, I do want to emphasize that the PNF training leverages those spindle mechanisms and GTO mechanisms that we talked about earlier.\\nBut I realized that in describing the quadricep contraction hamstring stretch, little mini experiment that hopefully you did, that I didn't really highlight the role of the GTOs, the Golgi tendon organs that much.\\nAnd I just would like to just briefly do that for a moment.\\nThe GTOs have multiple functions.\\nIn fact, I think even though GTOs are in every medical textbook, every physiology textbook, every first year neuroscientist learns about them when learning about the neuromuscular junctions and the mechanisms of interoception, et cetera, they are likely to have other functions as well.\\nAnd one of the reasons why PNF stretching does work, whether or not you're doing that by using a strap to pull back a limb or whether or not you're actively contracting your quadriceps to then release and emphasize stretch range of motion for your hamstrings and related muscle groups is that activation of those GTOs, meaning putting loads and tension into that system can inhibit the spindles in the opposite antagonistic muscle groups.\\nAnd so one of the reasons why flexing or I should say contracting your quadriceps really intensely for some period of time allows your hamstrings to subsequently experience greater range of motion.\\nAnd again, it's not just the hamstrings, but the related connective tissue and neural circuits, et cetera, is because yes, it's quote unquote relaxing the hamstrings and the spindle, but there's also a direct relationship between activation of the GTOs in the quadricep and release of the spindles in the hamstring and related muscles.\\nThis has a name, it's called autogenic inhibition.\\nIt's a fancy name for contraction of one muscle group, providing a relaxation of the other muscle group that's antagonistic to it.\\nAnd it relates back to this idea of interleaving sets in the gym.\\nSo if you think back to that example, now it should make sense as to why, for instance, if you do, let's say a set of bench presses or shoulder presses and you, let's say you get 10 repetitions and you fail on the 11th, that muscle is very, very fatigued.\\nIf you were to rest some period of time and then go back and do another set, well, during the rest, that muscle group has been relaxing.\\nIt's obviously not contracting the same way it was during the resistance set, but by going and doing a pulling exercise that involves the antagonistic muscle group, so strongly contracting the back muscles through a pull like a pull down or a chin up or a row type exercise, you're activating or near activating the GTO system in those pulling muscles in a way that provides autogenic inhibition for the pushing muscles.\\nNow, again, the physios out there are probably either screaming or banging their heads against whatever sound system this happens to be arriving through to them saying, wait, but in many cases, the GTOs aren't activated enough to provide that autogenic inhibition.\\nThat's true, but even the sub-threshold activation of those intraspinal circuits, so the place where the GTO circuit and the spindle circuit interact, can provide an additional replenishment of, say, the pushing muscles while you're activating those pulling muscles.\\nAnd this is at least one, not the only, but at least one mechanisms by which interleaving push and pull, push and pull, for both strength and hypertrophy training, but also for range of motion stretching type training, can allow you to achieve better results in a shorter period of time.\\nAnd I raise this because I want to keep in mind the efficiency of any training program.\\nWe just a moment ago established that doing, for example, three sets of 30 second static holds can be very useful for the hamstrings with, let's just say for sake of simplicity and practicality, a minute's rest in between.\\nBut during that minute's rest, you can stretch the opposite antagonistic muscle group, such as the quadriceps.\\nOr if you want to use PNF training, you could do loading of the quadriceps in between.\\nSo there are a number of different ways in which you can start to interleave static stretching with PNF stretching.\\nYou can start to interleave even PNF type protocols with resistance training, although that gets a bit more complicated.\\nYou can really start to construct and build protocols that are ideal for you.\\nWhat we will do is for an upcoming neural network newsletter.\\nSo for those of you that aren't familiar, the Huberman Lab podcast has a so-called neural network newsletter.\\nThese are monthly newsletters where we put distilled points from the podcast and oftentimes protocols in a downloadable PDF form.\\nYou can access it by giving us your email.\\nWe don't share your email with anybody.\\nIf you want to see examples of these, you can go to hubermanlab.com and go to the menu and see newsletter.\\nYou don't have to sign up for anything to see examples of what these are like.\\nI'll provide a couple of different protocols.\\nOne that is pure static stretching, one that involves PNF type stretching, and I'll also put down a protocol that involves the antagonistic interleaved muscle training of the sort that I've been describing a few times throughout this episode.\\nAnd then you can try and apply those either separately or maybe combine them in some way that's useful for your goals.\\nThere are a couple of key elements that are essential for building a safe and effective range of motion increasing program that arrived to us both through the peer reviewed research and admittedly from people that have been involved in teaching and training range of motion for a very long period of time.\\nSome of you may be familiar with the so-called Anderson method.\\nIt's been around for a long time.\\nActually, I've never met Anderson.\\nI should know this.\\nI don't even know if he's still alive.\\nI hope he's still alive.\\nBut in any event, there are a lot of different features to the Anderson and other protocols.\\nBut one of the aspects of the Anderson protocol that I think is highly relevant, in fact, I know is relevant to the peer reviewed research that we're going to talk about in a few moments is this notion of pushing through pain and how active or how passive to be about static stretching.\\nNow, this is somewhat subjective, right? If you think about getting into a stretch, again, we'll just use the hamstrings, for example.\\nSo you're either reaching for your toes while seated or maybe you're using a strap and you're raising your foot overhead while lying down or maybe you're doing a toe touch type exercise.\\nHow far should you reach? Where is the end range of motion? Should you bounce? Should you not bounce? We're going to talk a little bit more about that in a moment.\\nBut Anderson has an interesting idea and principle which is thread through a lot of his teachings that I think are very much in keeping with the study that I'm about to describe next, where he emphasizes to, yes, to stretch to the end of the range of motion, but not to focus so much on where that range of motion happens to be that day.\\nSo for instance, not thinking, oh, I can always touch my toes, for instance.\\nAnd therefore that's the starting place for my flexibility training today.\\nBut rather to take the entirety of your system into account each day and understand that, okay, provided you're warmed up appropriately, that you're now going to stretch your hamstrings, for instance, and you're going to reach down for your toes, but that your range of motion might be adjusted that day by way of tension and stress or by way of ambient temperature in the room.\\nAnd to basically define the end range of motion as the place where you can feel the stretch in the relevant muscle groups.\\nI think this is important because unlike resistance training or cardiovascular training, where we can measure distance traveled over time in the case of cardiovascular training or how much weight is on the bar and count repetitions, et cetera, with range of motion training, of course, range of motion is the feature that we're interested in, but there is likely to be a lot of variation from day to day based on a number of different internal and external factors.\\nAnd so the Anderson method is really about getting into static and other forms of stretching.\\nI think today we've mainly been focusing on static stretching and holding the end range of motion, but really paying attention to the feel of the stretch and the muscles involved.\\nAnd there are parallels in resistance and cardiovascular training too, I realize, right? In the case of trying to build hypertrophy, or I should say improve hypertrophy muscle size, oftentimes the best advice that one can give is to don't try to lift weights, but rather to challenge muscles.\\nNow, of course, you need to provide adequate loads in order to get hypertrophy, but when you're training purely for strength, it's about moving weights.\\nWhen you're training purely for hypertrophy or mainly for hypertrophy, it's really about challenging muscles using weights or other forms of resistance.\\nAnd similarly, and in keeping with this Anderson method, when trying to build limb range of motion, doing static stretching at a place where it's difficult, but that you can experience the stretch of the muscle cognitively, consciously, being able to focus on the muscles and their stretch is at least as useful as is evaluating the current range of motion you're able to achieve.\\nSo what does this mean? This means feel the muscles as you stretch them, don't just go through the motions.\\nAnd this means don't get so attached to being able to always achieve, for instance, a stretch of a given distance within a given session.\\nYou might actually find that by just finding the place where you can't get much further and holding the static stretch there, that on the second and third set that you happen to be doing that day, that your range of motion will be increased considerably.\\nMaybe not, but very likely, yes, you will.\\nAnd of course, evaluating range of motion over time is the key parameter because that's the goal of all this type of work.\\nNow, along these lines, there is this variable that we've mentioned a few times of passive versus active stretching.\\nAnd there's this even more nebulous variable, this even more kind of subjective thing of how much effort to put into it.\\nShould you push into the stretch? Do you even want to bounce a tiny bit? Would you want to reach into that endpoint and try and extend it within a given set and session? And for that reason, I was excited to find this paper entitled, A Comparison of Two Stretching Modalities on Lower Limb Range of Motion Measurements in Recreational Dancers.\\nHappens to be done in recreational dancers.\\nIt's a six-week intervention program that compared low-intensity stretching, which they call micro-stretching.\\nThey used a capital M, so I don't know if that means that it's proprietary, although I didn't see evidence of conflict of interest.\\nBut they call it micro-stretching.\\nBut to be very clear, micro-stretching in the case of this manuscript is low-intensity stretching.\\nAnd they compared that with moderate-intensity static stretching on an active and passive ranges of motion.\\nOkay, so there are a lot of different variables are here, but I'll just highlight a few things that are really most relevant to us.\\nAnd I'll give you the takeaway at the outset and then return to it at the end, so that if I lose any of your attention in the next couple of minutes, at least you have that key takeaway.\\nBasically, what they found was that a six-week training program using very low-intensity stretching had a greater positive effect on lower limb range of motion than did moderate-intensity static stretching.\\nI find that incredibly interesting.\\nSo very low-intensity, and we'll define what that means in a moment.\\nHere I'm quoting them.\\nThe most interesting aspect of the study was the greater increase in active range of motion compared to passive range of motion by the micro-stretching group.\\nSo this relates to what we were just talking about a few moments ago as it relates to the Anderson method, which is that very low-intensity stretching, meaning effort that feels not painful, and in fact might even feel easy or at least not straining to exceed a given range of motion, turns out to not just be as effective, but more effective than moderate-intensity stretching.\\nSo what is low-intensity static stretching? Well, they define this as the stretches were completed at an intensity of 30 to 40%, where 100% equals the point of pain, right? So 30 to 40% in these individuals, and again, I'm paraphrasing, induced a relaxed state within the individual and the specific muscle, and here they were holding these static stretches, I should mention, for one minute, not 30 seconds.\\nNow the control group was doing the exact same overall protocol, so daily stretching for six weeks, the same exercises, holding each set for 60 seconds, but we're using an intensity of stretch of 80%, where again, 100 represents the point of pain, the point where the person would want to stop stretching.\\nI find these data incredibly interesting for I think what ought to be obvious reasons.\\nIf you're going to embark on a flexibility and stretching training program, you don't need to push to the point of pain.\\nIn fact, it seems that even just approaching the point of pain is going to be less effective than operating at this 30 to 40% of intensity prior to reaching that pain threshold, the pain threshold being 100%.\\nNow, of course, this is pretty subjective, but I think all of us should be able to register within ourselves, so whether a given range of motion or extending a given range of motion brings us to that threshold of pain or near pain, and according to this study at least, operating or performing stretching at an intensity that's quite low, that's very relaxing, turns out to be more beneficial in increasing range of motion than is doing exercises aimed at increasing range of motion at a higher intensity.\\nOkay, so lower intensity stretching, I should say lower intensity static stretching appears to be the most beneficial way to approach stretching, and I think that's a relief, probably to many of us, because it also suggests that the injury risk is going to be lower than if one were pushing into the pain zone, so to speak.\\nThe authors offer a number of different explanations as to why this approach, this micro-stretching approach might be more effective.\\nHere, I'm paraphrasing from their discussion where they mentioned that it could be hypothesized that they had improved reciprocal inhibition within the hamstring muscle group, so this gets right back to the sorts of neural mechanisms that we talked about before, that somehow by doing this low intensity stretching that they were able to access some of those spindle and GTO type mechanisms that we were referring to earlier and the inhibition of hamstring and quadricep stretches.\\nThey also offer a number of different ideas about how this could shift the activation of the so-called sympathetic, remember the kind of stress division of our nervous system, and to reduce that relative to activation of the parasympathetic arm of the nervous system.\\nI confess they have a couple of arguments around sympathetic, parasympathetic that are somewhat convoluted.\\nI will just, in fairness to the neuroscience on those systems, I wouldn't suggest putting too much weight on their arguments about sympathetic and parasympathetic.\\nTo my mind, they didn't really hold much water, but here I'm not trying to be disparaging of the overall work, which I think is really quite sound, which is that low intensity, so-called micro stretching, is going to be the most effective way to increase limb range of movement over time.\\nI want to just briefly return to this idea of whether or not to do ballistic or static stretching before some sort of skill training or weight training or any kind of sport or even cardiovascular exercise like running.\\nAgain, the data are really split out there.\\nThere are even folks who suggest that doing any kind of stretching prior to running is going to lower running efficiency.\\nIt's going to require essentially more work and more oxygen uptake at a given speed for a variety of reasons, and runners and that community argue about this endlessly.\\nThere are papers in both sides, in both directions.\\nI'm sure I'll hear about some of this in the comments.\\nI'm not really going to take a stance on this as a consequence because the data are all over the place.\\nHowever, I think there's a general logic that we can apply, and here I'm borrowing from some conversations and some information put out there by Dr. Andy Galpin, who I think is, of course, both an expert and thinks about these things in a really sound and flexible way, no pun intended.\\nThere are instances, for example, where an individual might want to do some static stretching to increase limb range of motion prior to doing weight training, even if it's going to inhibit that person's ability to lift as much weight.\\nWhy would you want to do that? Well, for instance, if somebody has a tightness or a limitation in their neuromuscular connective tissue system, someplace in their body and system that prevents them from using proper form that they can overcome by doing some static stretching, well, that would be a great idea, as Dr. Galpin points out.\\nOr for instance, if proper stability within the movement requires increasing limb range of motion in some way, well, then compromising the use of greater loads could be greatly offset by doing some static stretching to improve, say, hamstring flexibility or another muscle group flexibility.\\nSo we can't always think about just what's going to allow us or inhibit us from using the maximal amount of weight or from running as far as we want to run, as fast as we want to run.\\nThere are instances where people are trying to overcome injuries, where they're trying to come back from a reparative surgery or something of that sort, coming back from a layoff, where some additional static stretching prior to cardiovascular weight training or skill training or sport of some kind is going to be useful because it's going to put us in a position of greater safety and confidence and performance overall, even if it's adjusting down our speed or the total amount of loads that we use.\\nSo it's you that needs to consider whether or not for you and within a given training session, you want to do static training, I should say static stretching range of motion training prior to or after that training session.\\nAnd similarly, there are a lot of data pointing to the fact that doing some dynamic or even ballistic stretching prior to skill training or cardiovascular weight training can be beneficial in part to warm up the relevant neural circuits, joints and connective tissue and muscles, and as well to perhaps improve range of motion or ability to perform those movements more accurately with more stability and therefore with more confidence.\\nAnd while Dr. Andy Galpin would never name any protocol after himself, he's far too humble to do that, I've named a couple of protocols after him, particularly the Galpin equation for hydration because he was willing to stick his neck out there and put down some specific numbers that people could follow in order to ensure proper hydration during training.\\nYou can look up the Galpin equation elsewhere, you can just Google it or look elsewhere, you'll find it.\\nAnd Dr. Galpin has also been very thoughtful and generous and I think very accurate in offering a kind of a general organizational logic for how to think about the goals of a particular training session and thereby to decide whether or not you're going to do ballistic or static stretching and so on and so forth.\\nSo we can refer to this general approach as Galpinian, Galpinian, is that right? Galpinian logic, Galpinian logic.\\nThus far we've been talking about stretching for sake of increasing limb flexibility and range of motion, but there are other reasons perhaps to embark on a stretching protocol that include both our ability to relax and access deep relaxation quickly, as well as even to reduce inflammation and perhaps even combat certain forms of cancer.\\nAnd if that sounds really far-fetched, I want to emphasize that the study I'm about to share with you in a moment was actually carried out by one of the directors of a division of the National Institutes of Health.\\nAnd this was the work of Helene Langevin, who's a medical doctor, has done really important work on the mechanisms underlying things like acupuncture and has approached all that from a very mechanistic viewpoint, right? So not looking just at the effects of acupuncture, but really trying to understand what sorts of cytokines, inflammatory molecules and pathways are activated, what sorts of neural mechanisms get engaged by things like acupuncture that impinges on the fascial tissues and so forth.\\nAnd Dr. Langevin is currently a director of the National Institutes of Complementary Health and Medicine at the National Institutes of Health.\\nSo this is a major division supported by tax dollars that support systematic mechanistic exploration of things like respiration, meditation, yoga, acupuncture.\\nSo this is serious science applied to protocols and approaches that have been used for some period of time, but really aimed at trying to understand what would the best protocols be to evolve new protocols.\\nSo there's a really interesting study done in animal models, but I think it's a powerful enough result that I think we all should pay attention to it.\\nThe title of this paper, and again, the last author is Dr. Langevin herself, is stretching reduces tumor growth in a mouse breast cancer model.\\nAnd yes, you can get mice to stretch.\\nIt turns out that if you gently lift up mice by their tail and they'll hold onto their cage, there's a way in which you can mechanically stretch them in a way that doesn't harm them.\\nFirst, I should mention that Dr. Langevin and others have shown that just a brief whole body stretch of that sort induces an increase in activation of the parasympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system.\\nAgain, not arm, limb, arm, but the aspect of the autonomic nervous system that creates a whole body, whole nervous system shift toward more relaxation.\\nSo yes, indeed, stretching induces relaxation at a systemic level, not just at a local level.\\nAnd I think that's important, probably not surprising to those of you that use stretching regularly, but yes, it does indeed relax us.\\nYes, you can do this in mice and see that in mice as well.\\nHere's what they did for this current study.\\nOr I should say this was a study published in 2018 in Scientific Reports.\\nThey write, recent studies have shown that gentle daily stretching for 10 minutes can reduce local connective tissue inflammation and fibrosis.\\nNow that's local tissue inflammation and fibrosis.\\nAs well, we now know as systemic inflammation and can induce relaxation systemically.\\nIn this case, they focused on mice, not humans.\\nAnd mice were randomized to a stretch versus no stretch condition and were treated for 10 minutes once a day for four weeks.\\nSo it's 10 minutes of this passive whole body stretching a day for four weeks.\\nWhat's remarkable, I mean, just I have to say is just striking is that tumor volume in these mice, they were able to induce tumors in these mice and the tumor volume at the end point was 52% smaller in the stretch group compared to the no stretch group.\\nThis is a highly significant effect.\\nAnd they point out in the absence of any other treatment.\\nAnd they explored whether or not cytotoxic immune responses were activated and a number of other features.\\nThey weren't able to get too deeply into the underlying mechanisms, but this is pretty remarkable.\\nEven three weeks into this stretching protocol, this daily stretching protocol for these mice, tumor volume was reduced.\\nI mean, by, you know, it's almost halved.\\nThis is pretty incredible.\\nSo they have these measures of tumor volume.\\nAnd the only difference in the way these animals were treated and handled was the introduction of this daily stretch.\\nI find this result to be of course, limited to the extent that it's done in an animal model, not in humans, we have to point it out.\\nBut as they point out in their discussion, our results demonstrate a 52% reduction in mammary tumor growth over one month in mice undergoing stretching for 10 minutes a day without any other form of therapy.\\nDo they think that stretching itself is changing the tumor size? No.\\nIn fact, they raised the possibility that stretching because of its impact on the fascia might even create micro environments that are more permissive for tumor growth in certain instances.\\nSo they're careful to emphasize what I also believe to be the case, which is that it's unlikely that the stretching itself was directly acting to reduce tumor size, but rather that there's this possible link between inflammation and immune exhaustion mechanisms that if you can periodically relax a nervous system here through stretching, that it can affect certain pathways related to the immune system that would allow the immune system to combat tumor growth to a significant degree.\\nSo again, even though this is a study in mice, it argues that relaxation induced by stretching can have a powerful influence on mammary tumor growth.\\nAgain, a huge effect carried out by one of the premier labs and individuals who do this sort of work and think about this sort of thing.\\nAnd of course, I want to point out it wasn't just Dr. Langevin that did this study.\\nThere are a number of co-authors on the study.\\nWe will provide a link to the co-authors.\\nExcuse me, we will provide a link to the study so that you can peruse it in more detail if you like.\\nNow, as a related and somewhat final point, I'd like to return to this idea and this place, this real estate within our brain that we call the insular cortex, the insula.\\nAs you recall, way back at the beginning of this episode, we were talking about the von Economo neurons that Constantine von Economo, the Austrian scientist discovered.\\nAnd the fact that we are able to make and perform interpretations of our internal landscape, pain, our dedication to a practice, for instance, whether or not we are in pain because it's a practice that we are doing intentionally and want to improve ourselves, or whether or not it's pain that's arriving through some externally imposed demands or situations.\\nWell, the insula is handling all that.\\nAnd fortunately, there's a wonderful paper that was published a few years ago now in the journal Cerebral Cortex, which is a fine journal.\\nThis is the year 2014, entitled Insular Cortex Mediates Increased Pain Tolerance in Yoga Practitioners.\\nI'll tell you why I like this study.\\nI'm personally not a practitioner of yoga.\\nI've taken a few yoga classes over the years.\\nI've done some of the hot yoga classes.\\nThose rooms can get really, really warm, I confess.\\nAnd I've done the kind of standard yoga every now and again.\\nIt's not something that I've kept up regularly.\\nThis study explored the effects on brain structure volume in yoga practitioners.\\nAnd for those of you out there that are aficionados in yoga, they pulled subjects from having backgrounds in the, here, I'm probably going to mispronounce these different things.\\nAnd forgive me, the vinyasa yogas, the ashtanga yogas, the yongar yogas, the sunanda yogas.\\nOkay, so some people were new to these practices.\\nSome were experienced.\\nThe important takeaways were that they took these yoga practitioners and they didn't explore their brain structure in the context of yoga itself.\\nThey looked at things like pain tolerance.\\nSo they used thermal stimulation.\\nBasically, they put people into conditions where they gave them very hot or very cold stimuli and compared those yoga practitioners of varying levels of yoga experience to those that had no experience with yoga, so-called controls.\\nAnd they found some really interesting things.\\nThere are a lot of data on this paper, but here's something I'd like to highlight.\\nThe pain tolerance of yoga practitioners was double or more to that of non-yoga practitioners, even for those that weren't doing the so-called hot yoga, right? They also found that pain tolerance was significantly greater, both for heat pain and for cold pain.\\nThey also found significant increases in insular, again, the insula, this brain region, gray matter volume.\\nTypically, when we talk about gray matter, we're talking about the so-called cell bodies, the location in neurons where the genome is housed and where all the housekeeping stuff is there.\\nAnd then white matter volume tends to be the axons, the wires, because they're in sheaths with this stuff that appears white in MRIs and indeed is white under the microscope, and indeed is white, it's actually lipid, which is myelin.\\nSo increased gray matter volume of the insula is a significant finding because what it suggests is that people that are doing yoga have an increased volume of these areas of the brain that are associated with interceptive awareness and for being able to make judgments about pain and why one is experiencing pain, not just to lean away from pain, but to utilize or leverage or even overcome pain.\\nSo there are many studies of yoga and meditation out there, few that have as much mechanistic detail as this one.\\nAnd in fact, there's a beautiful figure, figure three in this paper, that shows that the gray matter volume of this particular brain region scales in an almost linear way with the duration of yoga practice that somebody has been taking on in years.\\nSo people that had, they had a few subjects that have up to 15 or 16 years of yoga practice had much larger left insular gray matter volume, bigger brain areas associated with these abilities.\\nAnd I find this interesting because there are a lot of activities out there that don't create these kinds of changes in brain volume, especially within the insula.\\nSo it appears that it's not just the performance of the yogic movements, but the overcoming or the kind of pushing into the end ranges of motion and to push through discomfort to some extent.\\nOf course, we want people doing that in a healthy, safe way, but that's allows yoga practitioners to build up the structure and function of these brain areas that allow them to cope with pain better than other individuals and to cope with other kinds of interceptive challenges, if you will, not just pain, but cold, not just pain, but discomfort of being in a particular position to do that.\\nAnd again, we wouldn't want people placing themselves into a compromised position literally that would harm them, especially given that earlier we heard that micro stretching of the kind of non-painful sword, low intensity sword is actually going to be more effective for increasing end range of motion.\\nBut this study really emphasizes the extent to which practitioners of yoga don't just learn movements, they learn how to control their nervous system in ways that really reshapes their relationship to pain, to flexibility and to the kinds of things that the neuromuscular system was designed to do.\\nAnd as a final point, there's a beautiful graph in this paper, beautiful I think because it explores some of the more subjective dimensions of yoga and insular function, which is a, here I'll read it out in the nerdy form and then I'll explain what it means.\\nThis is a frequency histogram of categories of mental strategies used by yogis versus controls during the cold pain tolerance task.\\nWhat they're describing here and showing is quantitatively how people are conceptualizing cold pain in order to get through it.\\nAnd the different categories are for instance, distraction, right? Some people just choose to distract themselves from pain or to attempt to, other people will try to ignore it.\\nIt's a lot like distraction, but nonetheless, to engage in a negative emotion, sort of like, like I'm going to dig, I'm going to be in resistance to this.\\nControl subjects tended to use those approaches, whereas practitioners of yoga tended to use other sorts of subjective approaches like positive imagery to some extent, the ability to relax despite the extreme cold, the ability to quote unquote accept, like this is just happening despite the extreme cold, to observe, to third person themselves and the greatest effect of course was to breathe, to focus on their respiration as a way to deal with this challenge, this cold challenge.\\nNow, all of that is our subjective data, but I want to remind you that the practitioners of yoga are not just using entirely different mental strategies, but they are far more effective at dealing with pain.\\nTheir pain tolerance is much higher as evidenced by the other data in the previous graphs in the paper.\\nSo while this podcast episode is most certainly not about yoga per se, it's about flexibility and stretching.\\nFlexibility and stretching are elements within yogic practices.\\nAnd of course, yogic practices involve breathing and mental work and a lot of other things, balance, et cetera.\\nIt's a vast landscape as many of you know.\\nBut I think that if ever there was a manuscript that pointed to the utility of something like yoga for sake of tapping into a particular set of brain circuits and mechanisms that could wick out into multiple dimensions of life.\\nSo day-to-day life, stress, challenges in dealing with all sorts of external stressors, career-related, family-related, relationally, et cetera, excuse me, but as well for increasing range of motion, for increasing flexibility.\\nSo if ever there was a practice that one could embark on that would not only increase flexibility and limb range of motion, but would also allow one to cultivate some improved mental functioning as it relates to pain tolerance and other features of stress management that no doubt wick out into other areas of life.\\nIt appears that yoga is a quite useful practice.\\nAnd so for those of you that are interested in increasing limb range of motion, and you're already a practitioner of yoga, great.\\nI can imagine that someday there'll be another study like this one and you'll be in that 10 or 15 to 16 year practitioner graph.\\nYou'll be that dot way out on the far end of the graph that shows that your insula is that much bigger than the rest of ours.\\nAnd therefore your internal awareness and pain thresholds and stress management will be that much better.\\nBut of course, yoga isn't the only way to increase limb range of motion and flexibility.\\nUp until now, we've described a number of different ways to do that.\\nAnd we've arrived at some general themes and protocols.\\nAgain, those themes and protocols will be distilled into some specific and precise list in our neural network newsletter, but we can revisit a couple of them now just in summary and synthesis.\\nStatic stretching appears to be at least among the more useful forms of stretching.\\nSo low or zero momentum stretching, typically at end range of motion.\\nI love this concept of micro stretching, even though it's just a couple of studies that have addressed whether or not high intensity or low intensity static stretch holds are more beneficial.\\nThe idea and indeed the data that low intensity, so 30 to 40% of what one would consider painful appears to be more effective than 80% of that threshold.\\nI find that incredibly interesting.\\nAnd then there's this idea of frequency.\\nIt really does appear that getting at least five minutes per week total of stretching for a given muscle group is important for creating meaningful lasting changes in limb range of motion.\\nAnd that is best achieved by five day a week or six day a week or even seven day a week protocols, but those can be very short protocols limited to say three sets of 30, maybe even 45 or 60 seconds of static hold.\\nAlthough 30 seconds seems to be a key threshold there that can get you maximum benefit.\\nThere is no need to do full 60 second holds unless you're doing fewer total sessions per week.\\nAnd of course, to always warm up or to arrive at the stretching session warm.\\nAnd then of course, there are the other forms of stretching that we touched upon a bit, things like PNF.\\nAnd we talked about why PNF works, things like the spindle and the Golgi tendon organ reflexes that are built into all of us that we arrive in this world with.\\nAnd of course, the other forms of stretching that are known to be effective and important such as dynamic and ballistic stretching.\\nAgain, stretching protocols that involve a lot of momentum in order to improve range of motion for performance of particular types of work that one is about to embark on.\\nTypically that would be physical work, but a whole interesting and unexplored landscape is the extent to which changing limb range of motion and different types of body movement actually shape our cognitive abilities.\\nAnd that will be the topic of a future episode of this podcast.\\nIf you're learning from and are enjoying this podcast, please subscribe to our YouTube

       " Document(page_content=\"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.\\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.\\nToday is an Ask Me Anything or AMA episode, which is part of our premium subscriber content.\\nOur premium channel was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast channel, which still comes out once a week, every Monday, and of course is zero cost to consumer.\\nThe premium channel is also designed to support exciting research being done at major universities like Stanford and elsewhere, research that's done on humans that should lead to protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance in the near future.\\nIf you'd like to check out the premium channel subscription model, you can go to hubermanlab.com slash premium, and there you can subscribe for $10 a month or $100 a year.\\nWe also have a lifetime subscriber option.\\nFor those of you that are already Huberman Lab Podcast premium subscribers and you're watching and or hearing this, please go to hubermanlab.com slash premium and download the premium podcast feed.\\nAnd for those of you that are not already Huberman Lab premium podcast subscribers, you will be able to hear the first 15 minutes or so of this episode, and hopefully that will allow you to discern whether or not you would like to become a premium subscriber.\\nWithout further ado, let's get to answering your questions.\\nAnd as always, I will strive to be as accurate as possible, as thorough as possible, and yet as concise as possible.\\nThe first question is about how to improve sleep, in particular, how to improve deep sleep that is sometimes called slow wave sleep.\\nThis was a question that was asked by Jack Pritchard, and they got a lot of upvotes.\\nNow, we've done multiple full length episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast on sleep and tools to improve sleep, including the master your sleep episode and perfect your sleep episode, as well as a toolkit that is available completely zero cost at hubermanlab.com.\\nIt's a downloadable PDF that lists out the behavioral tools and other tools that you can implement to improve your sleep.\\nNow, Jack's question is specifically about how to improve deep sleep.\\nHe asks, I have a sleep analyzer, and I typically observe that I get a lot of REM sleep, that is rapid eye movement sleep.\\nFor him, he says it's 30% of his total sleep is rapid eye movement sleep.\\nBut he asks, my deep sleep is often low, around 10%.\\nAnd I would like to know if there are any science back protocols I can use to specifically increase my deep sleep.\\nOkay, so for those of you that may not know, what is deep sleep? Now, deep sleep is sometimes referred to as slow wave sleep.\\nThat is slow wave sleep and deep sleep are sometimes used interchangeably to describe the same thing.\\nThey aren't necessarily the same thing, but they fall under the same mechanistic umbrella.\\nWhat is that mechanistic umbrella? Well, when you go to sleep at night, you cycle through a number of different stages of sleep.\\nAnd in the early part of the night, let's say in the first half of your night or so, most of your sleep is going to be slow wave deep sleep.\\nBut then as you transition into the second half of your night, more of your sleep will be rapid eye movement sleep.\\nNow, that's the typical pattern that is observed when you're not disrupting your sleep architecture with things like caffeine and alcohol.\\nWe'll talk about caffeine and alcohol in a few minutes.\\nDeep sleep, AKA slow wave sleep, at least for sake of this conversation, is vitally important in particular for repair of bodily tissues.\\nDuring deep sleep, you secrete growth hormone.\\nAnd in fact, you secrete growth hormone every night when you go to sleep.\\nBut most of that growth hormone release is restricted to the first half of your sleep night.\\nThe other feature of deep sleep is that the dreams that occur during deep sleep tend to be of a less emotional nature than the sorts of dreams that one experiences in rapid eye movement sleep.\\nSo just to give a broad top contour of what deep sleep, AKA slow wave sleep, is really about, it tends to occur in the first half of the night.\\nIt also occurs in the second half of the night.\\nBut in the first half of the night, most of your sleep is going to be occupied by deep sleep, AKA slow wave sleep.\\nIt is the time when your bodily tissues are repaired in part by release of growth hormone, which is involved in metabolism, but also protein synthesis, muscle repair, repair of all cell types and tissues.\\nAnd during deep sleep, your dreams tend to be somewhat mundane, sometimes a little bizarre, but typically not very emotionally loaded.\\nThat can change if you're dealing with a lot of emotionally laden circumstances in your waking life.\\nBut in general, the sleep and dreams that occur in the first part of the night is deep and it's not terribly emotionally ridden.\\nYour body also goes through specific patterns of metabolism.\\nThis relates to recent findings just this last year in which researchers monitored the output of people's breath and the various metabolic factors present in the breath, as well as through blood draws.\\nSo basically doing all this while people are asleep in a laboratory.\\nAnd they observed that during the first half of the night, while people are in deep sleep, their body is actually metabolizing energy very differently than it does in the second half of the night.\\nI'll come back to this in a little while, but this turns out to be very important for establishing your metabolism and the way you regulate insulin and blood glucose during the daytime.\\nSo all of this is to say that getting sufficient deep sleep, slow wave sleep is vitally important.\\nAnd Jack's asking how he can increase the amount of deep sleep that he's getting because by his sleep tracking method, he's observing far less deep sleep than rapid eye movement sleep.\\nNow that raises the question of how much deep sleep one should be getting overall.\\nIn general, the goal should be to balance the total amount of slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep across the night.\\nHowever, I would not want people to obsess over getting exactly 30% rapid eye movement sleep and exactly 30% slow wave sleep.\\nYour body is much more resilient than that.\\nBut the closer those two numbers are to one another, the better overall architecture of your sleep.\\nAnd he doesn't list out exactly how he's measuring his sleep.\\nSo I do want to put an asterisk on both the question and the answer I provide by stating that a lot of sleep trackers, whether or not they are whoop trackers or auras, or whether or not you're using a mattress-based or mattress cover-based sleep tracker like eight sleep or other, is using heart rate and heart rate variability and body movement to estimate or to kind of predict whether or not you're in slow wave sleep or rapid eye movement sleep.\\nAnd that's because during rapid eye movement sleep, you tend to be in what's called atonia.\\nYou tend to be paralyzed.\\nYou can't move.\\nAnd during slow wave sleep, that's not the case.\\nBut no matter what the sleep tracking method is, if it's a standard commercial sleep tracking method, whoop, aura, eight sleep, et cetera, it is an estimate or a best guess at what stage of sleep you're in.\\nWhereas when you go into a sleep laboratory like the sleep laboratory at Stanford, at University of Pennsylvania, or others of the great sleep laboratories that are out there, they're going to use other methods, including EEG and EMG.\\nThese are just acronyms that refer to ways to record brain waves.\\nThey actually are going to try and observe for rapid eye movements beneath the eyelids, et cetera.\\nSo sleep trackers give you a best guess as to what stage of sleep you're in.\\nThey are not perfectly accurate.\\nAt least none of the commercially available sleep trackers are perfectly accurate.\\nSo we do want to highlight that.\\nOkay, so now let's answer Jack's question directly, which is how to increase the total amount of slow wave sleep.\\nWell, there are a couple of ways.\\nFirst of all are the don'ts, and then we'll talk about the dos.\\nTwo things that you can do to really disrupt your slow wave sleep are to drink alcohol within eight hours prior to bedtime or even at all.\\nSome people will find that even if they have a glass of wine or a beer with lunch, that the amount of slow wave sleep and sometimes even the rapid eye movement sleep that they get at night is reduced and that their overall sleep architecture is disrupted.\\nThis has been shown again and again.\\nLikewise, avoiding caffeine within eight and ideally within 12 hours of bedtime would be preferable.\\nAnd if you're not a caffeine drinker, obviously you don't have to worry about this at all, but avoiding caffeine intake within that eight to 12 hours of bedtime will greatly assist in you getting more slow wave sleep and higher quality rapid eye movement sleep.\\nThis has been shown again and again.\\nAnd as well avoiding cannabis use and maybe even CBD use within eight to 12 hours of sleep can be very beneficial if your goal is to improve the quality of your sleep.\\nNow I know a lot of people rely on alcohol, cannabis and CBD in order to get into sleep.\\nHowever, it's been shown many times in human studies and this was discussed in the podcast episode that we did with the great Matt Walker, who's a professor of neuroscience and psychology at University of California, Berkeley and a world expert in sleep and sleep science.\\nMatt and I discussed the research showing that even though alcohol helps you fall asleep, even though cannabis can help you fall asleep and even though CBD can help people fall asleep, that it does disrupt and in many ways, reduce the quality of sleep that one gets.\\nSo that's disappointing news.\\nI know for a number of the people that rely on cannabis, CBD or alcohol to fall asleep, but I would encourage you to check out the episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast that we did about alcohol and about cannabis, including some of the health benefits of cannabis in certain situations, but also some of the detrimental effects of both alcohol and cannabis in other situations in particular for improving slow wave sleep.\\nSo that's actually three major don'ts.\\nAvoid caffeine, alcohol and cannabis and let's put under the umbrella of cannabis, THC and CBD in the eight and ideally within the 12 hours prior to sleep.\\nIf your goal is to improve the total amount of slow wave sleep that you're getting and your overall sleep architecture.\\nIn addition, it's well known that avoiding food intake in the two hours prior to sleep is going to greatly assist in the amount of growth hormone output that you achieve during the early stages of the night and the depth and duration of slow wave sleep.\\nNow, I want to place an asterisk on that statement by saying, if you go to sleep too hungry, it can also disrupt your sleep.\\nSo you're going to have to arrange your eating schedule and your sleeping schedule such that you're not eating too close to bedtime but you're also not going to bed so hungry that you can't fall asleep or that you don't get into deep sleep and stay asleep.\\nI can personally attest to the fact that if I'm too hungry, I can't fall asleep.\\nNow for me, most nights I'm going to eat dinner sometime between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.\\ndepending on time of year, schedules, what's going on, traffic, et cetera.\\nAnd I tend to go to sleep somewhere between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m., plus or minus an hour.\\nAgain, depending on time of year and what else is going on in life.\\nSo I normally have that buffer of two hours or so before going to sleep.\\nHowever, there are some nights where even if I eat dinner around 7 p.m., I'm quite hungry at 9 p.m. and I want to go to sleep.\\nIn that case, eating a small amount of food ought not to disrupt your slow wave sleep too much, but you do want to avoid eating large meals right before going to sleep unless, okay, unless completely fasting and not eating something late at night will prevent you from getting into any sleep at all.\\nIn other words, it's better to make sure that you're getting to sleep than it is to avoid food just so that you get increased growth hormone output and into slow wave sleep.\\nI hope that's clear.\\nYou know, I have had times in my life where I'm working very, very hard and I miss dinner or something comes up.\\nAnd I know some people can fall asleep quite easily on an empty stomach.\\nI've been able to do that.\\nAnd in particular, if I'm very exhausted, I also rely on a handful of supplements to fall asleep each night.\\nAlthough I'm not dependent on them.\\nThere've been times when I haven't been able to access those supplements and I can still fall asleep.\\nBut the point is that you don't want to be so hungry that you can't fall asleep.\\nAnd yet in an ideal circumstance, especially if you're trying to increase the amount of slow wave sleep, you would avoid food in the two hours or so before going to sleep.\\nIf you can avoid food for the three or four hours prior to sleep and still fall and stay asleep easily, that's even better for sake of increasing slow wave sleep and growth hormone output.\\nNow, there are some additional tools for improving slow wave sleep.\\nIn particular, the transitions between slow wave sleep and the other sleep stages.\\nBecause even though, as I mentioned earlier, the early part of your night is occupied primarily by slow wave sleep, all night long, you're transitioning from slow wave sleep into an intermediate stage of sleep and then into rapid eye movement sleep and then back again.\\nIt's just that in the early part of the night, more of that time is going to be occupied by slow wave sleep.\\nThe two ways to improve slow wave sleep that are well documented in the literature, and here we can point to some really nice papers that I'll reference in case you want to read further, is the first one is entitled, exercise improves the quality of slow wave sleep by increasing slow wave stability.\\nSlow wave stability has to do with, as researchers call it, the amount of power present in the different aspects of slow wave sleep.\\nSo this gets a little bit technical, but this is an instance in which they brought subjects into the laboratory.\\nThey measured brain waves by EEG.\\nThey had some other measurements as well, including subjective measures of sleep, and they looked at whether or not people were doing exercise or not prior to sleep.\\nNow, when I say prior to sleep, I mean, not within six hours prior to bedtime.\\nIn fact, exercising intensely in the six hours prior to bedtime for many people, not all, but for many people, can disrupt the total amount of slow wave sleep that they get and can also disrupt rapid eye movement sleep.\\nSo the conditions of the study were pretty straightforward.\\nIt was a randomized crossover trial.\\nBasically, they had people either sleeping and monitoring their sleep, or they had people doing an hour of exercise at 60% of their so-called VO2 max.\\nYou can look this up for 60 minutes, okay? 60% of their VO2 max, that was the intensity.\\nIt's breathing pretty hard, but not extremely hard.\\nIf we were going to map that to the so-called zone, zone two cardio being the kind of cardio you can do steady state while holding a conversation, this would be somewhere in the probably zone three or zone four, although that's not exactly what 60% of VO2 max is going to map to every time.\\nThink about relatively challenging cardiovascular output for 60 minutes, and they had them do that at least six hours prior to bedtime.\\nAnd this is an important end, they did have the subjects in this study in all conditions abstain from caffeine and alcohol.\\nSo that's very important.\\nAnd what they observed was an enhancement of slow wave sleep.\\nSo exercise of this sort turns out to be a very potent form of improving slow wave sleep.\\nNow I do not know, because the study as far as I know has not been done, whether or not doing resistance training or some other type of exercise would have led to the same effect.\\nAlthough I have to imagine that if it's moderately intense to intense resistance training, provided it's done far enough away from going to sleep, prior to six hours before sleep, that one ought to see the same effect.\\nSo that was not a condition in this study, but it's a very nice study.\\nThey looked at everything from changes in core body temperature to caloric expenditure.\\nThey didn't see huge changes in core body temperature changes.\\nSo that couldn't explain the effect.\\nIt really appears that the major effect of improving slow wave sleep was due to something in changing the fine structure of the brain waves that occur during slow wave sleep.\\nIn fact, and this is an important point, the subjects in this study did not report subjectively feeling that much better from their sleep.\\nSo you might say, well then why would I even want to bother? However, it's well known that getting sufficient slow wave sleep is important, not just for repair, excuse me, for repair of bodily tissues, but also for repair of brain tissues and repair and wash out of debris in the brain.\\nAnd that debris is known to lead to things like dementia.\\nSo getting the best quality slow wave sleep is extremely important for body and for brain and getting an hour of exercise that's moderately intense and making sure that you're not doing that exercise within the six hours prior to bedtime and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, certainly within the six hours prior to bedtime, but I would say in the eight to 12 hours prior to bedtime would be even better or not drinking alcohol at all.\\nOr I know there are people out there that don't drink caffeine at all.\\nI'm not one of those people, but we're sticking that caffeine intake to the very early part of the day.\\nThat has been shown to improve the quality and the overall architecture of sleep and slow wave sleep in particular.\\nThat's really what this study points to.\\nThere's another tool that can improve the amount and quality of slow wave sleep that you achieve at night.\\nThis is actually a tool that I've started using over the last six to eight months or so.\\nAs many of you know, I believe in getting behaviors right before embracing changes in supplementation or prescription drugs.\\nBehavioral tools consist of do's and don'ts.\\nAnd the do's and don'ts for sleep are well-documented in the master sleep episode and the perfect your sleep episode and the toolkit for sleep.\\nThey include getting morning sunlight in your eyes or bright light of other kinds, avoiding bright light from 10 PM to 4 AM, et cetera, et cetera.\\nAll that information is in the toolkit for sleep and those other full length episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast.\\nNow, there are supplements that can greatly improve the depth of your sleep and that can shorten the latency to fall asleep.\\nAnd here I'm not referring to melatonin.\\nAs many of you perhaps already know, I'm not a fan of melatonin for a variety of reasons, mainly the fact that most melatonin supplements out there don't actually contain the exact amount of melatonin that's listed on the bottle.\\nThey contain either much, much more or much, much less and that melatonin is a potent hormone that has impacts on not just sleep but on other hormone systems as well.\\nThe supplements that I've suggested and that I personally take in order to improve my sleep are magnesium threonate spelled T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E.\\nAnd interchangeably with that, one could use magnesium bisglycinate.\\nI do consider those interchangeable because both cross into cells and across the blood brain barrier in much the same way that makes them better candidates for improving sleep than some of the other forms of magnesium.\\nSo magnesium threonate, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine and something called apigenin, which is essentially what you find in chamomile that is the reason why chamomile can make you sleepy.\\nA-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin.\\nThe dosages for those, et cetera, are described in the toolkit for sleep and why some people might want to avoid theanine.\\nI'll just tell you, for those of you that have very intense dreams or that might sleepwalk or have night terrors, you might want to avoid theanine because it can enhance the kind of emotional and elaborate nature of dreams.\\nOther people like that.\\nSo I'll take magnesium threonate, theanine and apigenin as a so-called sleep stack about 30 to 60 minutes prior to sleep.\\nI do not take them during the day.\\nThere is, however, another supplement that used in combination with the sleep stack that I just described or alone can greatly enhance the quality of your sleep.\\nAnd in particular, people who are following a low carbohydrate diet who have trouble falling and staying asleep seem to benefit from it.\\nAnd that is so-called inositol.\\nNow, inositol comes in different forms, but the form that I'm referring to here in terms of enhancing slow-wave sleep is myoinositol.\\nThere are an enormous number of studies on inositol for sake of mental health and for sake of enhancing various aspects of cellular function and for sake of improving sleep.\\nI'd like to just highlight one paper.\\nThe title of this paper will make it clear what it's about.\\nThe title of the paper is The Impact of Myoinositol Supplementation on Sleep Quality in Pregnant Women, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study.\\nNow, as I just told you, the study was carried out on pregnant women but there have been other studies of inositol on other populations.\\nAnd the major takeaway from these studies is that inositol can improve the quality of sleep and can adjust the architecture of sleep in ways that make it a great candidate for improving the structure and maybe also the duration of slow-wave sleep in particular.\\nI find that if I'm following a lower carbohydrate diet, which I do from time to time, I sometimes have trouble falling asleep.\\nOr if I eat four to six hours prior to bedtime, then I tend to be pretty hungry around bedtime.\\nAnd sometimes if I'm exercising very hard or if I'm working a lot, even if I eat dinner around seven and I go to sleep around 10 p.m., I might be a little bit hungry still at 10 p.m.\\nIn that case, I find that taking 900 milligrams of myoinositol in addition to the other sleep stack that I just described greatly enhances my ability to fall asleep and to get terrific quality sleep.\\nI do monitor my sleep.\\nI do that two ways.\\nI do that these days with my eight sleep sleep tracker.\\nAnd I use a whoop sleep tracker when I sleep.\\nThe combination of those two taps into different aspects of sleep tracking, heart rate variability, movement, et cetera.\\nIn a future episode, we'll talk about what are the best devices for monitoring sleep, which have certain advantages and others have disadvantages.\\nBut I certainly see it in the objective data that is from the sleep tracking data.\\nAnd I also observed subjectively that taking 900 milligrams of inositol prior to sleep, again, 30 to 60 minutes prior to sleep can greatly enhance the ability to fall asleep and for me to stay asleep throughout the night.\\nI also noticed another effect, which is that if I wake up in the middle of the night to use the restroom, which I often do, I find it much easier to fall back asleep.\\nI don't tend to get into kind of looping thought and things of that sort in the middle of the night.\\nAnd that may relate to the fact that myoinositol has been studied in many cases for its role in controlling anxiety, that is for reducing anxiety.\\nAnd that's one of the reasons, in fact, one of many reasons why people take myoinositol during the daytime.\\nThere's studies of myoinositol for dealing with anxiety, for sleep, as we're discussing now, and even for improving fertility and things of that sort in particular in women.\\nSo again, 900 milligrams of inositol can be a useful tool.\\n60 minutes of exercise as described previously can be a tool.\\nAnd certainly avoiding caffeine and alcohol is an excellent tool for enhancing the total amount of slow wave sleep.\\nJack had a second part to his question.\\nHe asked, is having a high level of rapid eye movement sleep and a lower level of deep sleep likely to cause any health issues? And to be honest, it's not really clear that it would cause any specific health issues.\\nAlthough if we think about what the specific roles of slow wave sleep versus rapid eye movement sleep are, again, rapid eye movement sleep being laden with highly emotional dreams, it's thought to act as a sort of trauma release where people are paralyzed in body, and that's a healthy paralysis, the so-called sleep atonia, but undergoing some pretty emotional stuff within their dreams.\\nAnd there is a lack of ability for the body to secrete adrenaline during rapid eye movement sleep.\\nThat's thought to be important for emotional repair, if you will, during the night.\\nCertainly studies where people have been deprived of rapid eye movement sleep have shown that their ability to manage emotionally during the daytime is reduced.\\nCertainly if you have reduced rapid eye movement sleep for multiple nights, that's going to be the case.\\nThe only caveat to that is that there are certain forms of treating depression that involves specifically depriving people of rapid eye movement sleep.\\nThat's a whole other story that was covered in the podcast episode with Dr. Nolan Williams.\\nSo if you want to learn more as to why that's the case, check out that episode.\\nBut because slow wave sleep, which occurs again during the early part of the night, is when growth hormone is released, and when there's this periodic washout of debris within the brain, and to some extent, within certain tissues of the body, you could imagine that reduced slow wave sleep would lead to reduced ability to recover from exercise, from injury, maybe even relate to the immune system.\\nHowever, I am personally not aware of any studies that specifically looked at the ratio of slow wave sleep to rapid eye movement sleep, and that focused in particular on reduced slow wave sleep for bodily repair.\\nThose studies might be out there.\\nI was not able to find them.\\nIf you are able to find them, please put them in the comment section, and I would love to check out those studies.\\nSo I don't think that one needs to be overly concerned if you're not getting a balance of slow wave sleep to rapid eye movement sleep that's perfect.\\nHowever, and as I mentioned earlier, it would be good to strive to try and balance the amount of slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep across the entire night.\\nIf you think about it, that will also tell you whether or not you're getting sufficient total sleep.\\nAnd I don't want to open up another set of questions here as I'm about to close out an answer to this question, but I do often get asked the question whether or not four hours is enough, or six hours is enough, or eight hours is enough.\\nWell, it's impossible to know exactly how much sleep each individual person needs.\\nAnd of course, each individual person will need a different amount of total sleep depending on the amount of stress and physical strain and various other things they're dealing with in their daily waking life.\\nHowever, it's generally the case that kids and people that are undergoing puberty and certainly in early infancy need more sleep than adults do.\\nSo as you age, you do in fact need less sleep.\\nOne good metric of whether or not you are getting enough sleep is whether or not you're sleepy during the daytime or not.\\nIf you're falling asleep a lot during the daytime, you're probably not getting enough sleep at night.\\nThat's sort of a duh, but it's an important duh to pay attention to.\\nAnd for those of us like myself that need a 20 or 30 minute nap in the afternoon, great, that doesn't necessarily mean you're not getting enough sleep at night.\\nOkay, so if you get sleepy enough to want to nap in the afternoon, that's not an indication necessarily that you are not getting enough sleep at night.\\nHowever, if you're only sleeping four or five hours per night, it's very hard to imagine that you're getting a balance of slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.\\nOnce you get into the range of sleeping six to eight hours and certainly eight to 10 hours per night, the probability that you're getting a balance of slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep greatly increases.\\nSo if I were to throw out a number, I would say for most people, that is for 95% of people out there, getting at least six hours of sleep per night, at least, and ideally more like seven or eight is going to be the goal.\\nHowever, I've noticed, for instance, for myself, unless I'm exercising extremely intensely or I'm going through a lot of emotional or physical stress in my daily life, getting six and a half to seven hours of sleep per night allows me to feel really good and refreshed throughout the day.\\nAnd that's especially the case if I get that 20 or 30 minute nap in the afternoon or use an SDR, non-sleep deep rest.\\nSo I hope that answers your question, Jack.\\nAnd there, of course, I'm extending the answer to all others who upvoted that question or who might be interested in improving their slow wave sleep.\\nThere are some dos, there are some don'ts that I just described.\\nI suggest trying various things one by one to see what works best for you.\\nSo you don't necessarily need to leap to doing the 60 minutes of exercise plus the inositol, et cetera.\\nHowever, I do encourage everyone to avoid alcohol and caffeine within the eight to 12 hours prior to sleep.\\nAnd again, if you're not using either of those, that would be even better, at least in terms of sleep architecture.\\nThank

       " Document(page_content=\"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.\\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.\\nToday, we're discussing alcohol, one of the most commonly consumed substances on the planet Earth.\\nShe mentioned that both humans and non-human animals consume alcohol, either for recreational purposes, because they like the feeling that it gives them, or for medicinal purposes, or for other purposes that we'll discuss.\\nWe are, of course, going to discuss the effects of alcohol on our biology, ranging from its effects on individual cells, on organs and organ systems in our brain and body.\\nWe are also going to discuss the effects of the effects of alcohol.\\nThat is what being inebriated really does to our thinking and our behavior and how it does it.\\nAnd we are going to address what seems to be one of the more common questions out there, which is whether or not low to moderate amounts of drinking are better for our health than zero alcohol consumption at all.\\nAnd of course, we will talk about severe alcohol intake, binge drinking.\\nWe will also talk about hangover and what science says about ways to reduce the effects of hangover, either by doing things that are inoculatory, meaning before you drink or while you drink, as well as things to do if you happen to have a hangover.\\nWe will discuss some of the genetic differences for alcohol and alcoholism.\\nAnd we will discuss alcohol consumption in young people and how that can be especially detrimental for reasons that I think are going to be quite surprising to most of you.\\nMy goal is that by the end of today's episode, you will have a thorough understanding of what alcohol does to your brain and body, and that you will be able to make informed decisions as to whether or not you should be consuming zero, absolutely no alcohol, small to moderate amounts of alcohol.\\nAnd again, we'll define exactly what that means, small to moderate amounts.\\nAnd if you or somebody else that you know is consuming excessive amounts of alcohol that are clearly detrimental to your health, some of the better routes and resources that you can use in order to remove that dependence and or consumption.\\nI'd like to preface all of that by saying that today's discussion is really geared toward giving you information.\\nIt is not about judging alcohol intake or lack of alcohol intake.\\nI just want you to be able to make the most informed decision about alcohol possible.\\nI'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab podcast is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.\\nWe partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.\\nFirst of all, they ship internationally because we know that many of you are located outside of the United States.\\nSecond of all, and perhaps most important, the quality of their supplements is second to none, both in terms of purity and precision of the amounts of the ingredients.\\nThird, we've really emphasized supplements that are single ingredient supplements and that are supplied in dosages that allow you to build a supplementation protocol that's optimized for cost, that's optimized for effectiveness, and that you can add things and remove things from your protocol in a way that's really systematic and scientific.\\nIf you'd like to see the supplements that we partnered with Momentus on, you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.\\nThere you'll see those supplements, and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding the library of supplements available through Momentus on a regular basis.\\nAgain, that's livemomentus.com slash Huberman.\\nBefore we get into today's content in detail, I just want to answer a commonly asked question about alcohol consumption and the brain.\\nAnd the question that so often comes up is whether or not low to moderate amounts of alcohol, so maybe one drink a day or one or two drinks a day kind of thing, whether or not that is bad for your brain, in particular, whether or not it causes degeneration of neurons or nerve cells.\\nNow, the reason that question comes up so often is because for many years, it's been known that high levels of alcohol consumption, so 12 to 24 drinks per week or more, is certainly causing neurodegeneration, in particular of the so-called neocortex, the outer layers of the brain that house associative memories, that house our ability to think and plan, that house our ability to regulate our more primitive drives according to context, et cetera.\\nSo to make very clear, drinking a lot, so having three or four drinks per night every night of the week is clearly bad for the brain.\\nA recent study, however, finally addressed the question of whether or not low to moderate amounts of alcohol consumption can cause brain degeneration.\\nThe title of the study is Associations Between Alcohol Consumption and Gray and White Matter Volumes in the UK Biobank, the United Kingdom Biobank.\\nFirst of all, gray matter are the neurons, it's the so-called cell bodies that house the genome of the cells, et cetera, and white matter is the connections, the fibers, the so-called axons of neurons, and it's called white matter because that tissue is surrounded by a fatty tissue called myelin, which allows nerve cells to communicate with each other very quickly.\\nSo what this study did is it looked at the brains, both the gray matter and the white matter, of more than 30,000, indeed more than 35,000, generally healthy middle-aged and older adults in the United Kingdom who were drinking various amounts of alcohol.\\nWhat they found was that even for people that were drinking low to moderate amounts of alcohol, so one or two drinks per day, there was evidence of thinning of the neocortex, so loss of neurons in the neocortex and other brain regions.\\nAnd I don't say this in order to cause alarm, I tell you this because they are important data because they reveal and indeed answer the question that has been burning for so long whether or not chronic alcohol intake can disrupt the brain, even if the chronic intake is very low.\\nNow we should talk about what the word chronic means because many people, when they hear the word chronic, think high levels of whatever intake, okay? So they think five drinks a night or 10 drinks a night or people drinking every night.\\nNow in this study, they looked at people who on average were drinking one or two drinks per night.\\nSo that could be 14 drinks on the weekend, it could be one drink per night, it could be seven drinks on Friday.\\nIn other words, on average, one or two drinks per night.\\nAnd I think many people out there are drinking somewhere between one and two drinks per night or day of the week on average.\\nSo that would be seven to 14 drinks per week.\\nSo this is an important study because it says that if you're consuming even just seven glasses of wine across the week, it's likely that there is going to be some degeneration of your brain in response to that alcohol intake.\\nAlthough, as mentioned earlier, we will talk about some of the things that can inoculate against some of that neuronal loss.\\nFor those of you that are interested in reading the study in more detail, we've put a link to it in the show note captions.\\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.\\nIt is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public.\\nIn keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.\\nOur first sponsor is Levels.\\nLevels is a program that lets you see how different foods affect your health by giving you real-time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor.\\nOne of the most important features of our immediate feelings of wellbeing and our ability to focus and think and move and have energy as well as our long-term health are our blood glucose levels.\\nThat is our blood sugar levels.\\nAnd that's because all the cells and tissues of our body and especially neurons, nerve cells, rely on glucose for fuel.\\nI realize some of you out there are ketogenic and yes, you can use ketones for fuel, but the vast majority of people are using glucose for fuel in their cells.\\nIf you want to maintain energy and focus throughout the day, you want to keep that blood glucose steady and you don't want it ever to spike or to drop too much.\\nSo you need to understand how different foods and indeed how different activities impact your blood glucose.\\nI started using Levels about a year ago as a way to understand how different foods and exercise and supplements and combinations of food and exercise and even sequencing, like when I do what, how that affects my blood glucose levels.\\nIt's been tremendously informative.\\nIt's completely reshaped when I exercise, how I exercise, when I eat relative to exercise, et cetera.\\nSo if you're interested in learning more about Levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself, go to levels.link slash Huberman.\\nAgain, that's levels.link slash Huberman.\\nToday's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.\\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating and sleep tracking capacity.\\nI've talked many times on the podcast about the fact that getting a great night's sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health and all forms of performance.\\nAnd one of the key variables in getting a great night's sleep is making sure that your sleeping environment is the right temperature.\\nIndeed, your brain and body have to drop by one to three degrees in order to get into sleep and to stay in deep sleep throughout the night.\\nIf your room is too hot or if you're running too warm, you will wake up.\\nIn fact, that is why you wake up in the morning.\\nWith Eight Sleep, you can adjust the temperature of your mattress and your overall sleeping environment and customize that to you.\\nI started using Eight Sleep some time ago and it's just been a total game changer.\\nI program mine so that there's a subtle drop in the temperature of my mattress at the beginning of the night and then it gets progressively cooler and then it heats up toward morning.\\nEven has this nice little vibrate feature.\\nSo it wakes me up by vibrating the mattress a little bit.\\nAnd of course that mattress is warming and warming is the way that we wake up.\\nIf you'd like to try Eight Sleep, go to eightsleep.com slash Huberman, check out their pro prod cover and save

brought to us by Roca.\\nRoca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality and they also have some unique characteristics.\\nThe company was founded by two all-American swimmers from Stanford and everything about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.\\nRoca eyeglasses and sunglasses can be worn while running or cycling.\\nIf you get sweaty, they won't fall off your face and they're extremely lightweight.\\nIn fact, most of the time, I can't even remember that I'm wearing them.\\nI wear Roca eyeglasses when I read at night, so I wear their readers and I wear sunglasses at various times throughout the day.\\nThe great thing about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses is that even though they were designed for athletic performance, they have a terrific aesthetic.\\nSo unlike a lot of so-called performance glasses that make people look like cyborgs, in my opinion, Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses are the sort that you could wear out to dinner, that you could wear to work.\\nThey have a terrific aesthetic.\\nIf you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses, you can go to roca, that's R-O-K-A.com and enter the code Huberman

consuming alcohol for thousands of years.\\nIf you look at the archeological evidence from Mesopotamia, you'll find that 5,000 years ago, people had wine vessels.\\nOr if you want to know when people first started distilling alcohol, much to people's surprise, that did not first take place in Ireland.\\nAnd that's not a joke about the Irish, that you'll see a lot of claims online that the Irish were the first to distill alcohol, but in fact, they were not.\\nIt was the Chinese that were the first to distill alcohol.\\nAnd that took place in China in the first century.\\nAlcohol has been used for nutritional purposes.\\nSo there are cultures that believe, and indeed still believe, that the calories in alcohol are useful, although later we'll talk about how alcohol calories are indeed empty calories and what an empty calorie really is, why it's called empty.\\nAlcohol has been used for medicinal purposes because indeed it does kill bacteria.\\nAnd as you'll soon find out, the fact that it kills bacteria because that is absolutely true, it also kills the good bacteria in your gut and the destruction of that good bacteria in your gut can lead to things like leaky gut syndrome and has all sorts of issues and there are ways to deal with those issues and we'll talk about those.\\nSo alcohol has been used for medicinal purposes.\\nIt's been used to clean surfaces.\\nIt's used in my laboratory in order to make up so-called reagents to do our experiments.\\nBut most humans have been consuming alcohol in order to change their internal state, in order to feel differently than they would otherwise.\\nThat feeling of being drunk or inebriated or tipsy or lightheaded is something that many, not all, but many humans seem to enjoy and pursue, even though typically it leads to a feeling of being less happy, less motivated, more stressed, et cetera, when the alcohol wears off.\\nThat's pretty incredible, right? I mean, we're talking about a substance that people have been highly motivated to pursue that are still highly motivated to pursue, to create and to consume, that they'll spend money on.\\nAnd that's despite the fact that it makes them feel good and then it makes them feel lousy.\\nNow, some of you might be saying, well, I drink, but I don't drink to excess and therefore I don't feel lousy.\\nI feel good when I drink and then it wears off and it allows me to get through my evening and then the next morning I'm ready to go.\\nOkay, that very well may be true.\\nI believe those people.\\nAnd as I mentioned at the beginning of the episode, I'm not here to demonize alcohol in any way, but I do want to point out what alcohol is and how it creates the effects that it does.\\nAnd then I want to talk about what those effects are when you engage in consuming alcohol, even as often as one or two nights per week, or let's say you're just somebody who has a drink or two on Friday, maybe a few more on Saturday, or maybe you're somebody who consumes all your alcohol one night per week or one night per month.\\nWe'll talk about how that's affecting your biology.\\nSo let's address what alcohol is and how it affects the cells and tissues and organs of your body.\\nThen we'll take a look at some of the epidemiology, that is how many people are consuming alcohol and how much they're drinking.\\nAnd then you'll be able, I think, to get a good sense of how the alcohol that you're drinking, if you're drinking any at all, is impacting your brain and body and the choices you might want to make about how and when to drink alcohol, or even if you want to eliminate alcohol altogether.\\nOkay, so some basic chemistry and biology of alcohol.\\nAnd again, I'll make this very clear.\\nEven if you don't have a chemistry and biology background, because of the structure of alcohol, it is what's called both water-soluble and fat-soluble.\\nTranslated into what's meaningful for you, what that means is when you drink alcohol, it can pass into all the cells and tissues of your body.\\nIt has no trouble just passing right into those cells.\\nSo unlike a lot of substances and drugs that actually attach to the surface of cells, to receptors, as they're called, little parking spots, and then trigger a bunch of downstreams, like domino cascades of effects, alcohol actually has its own direct effects on cells because it can really just pass into those cells.\\nSo it's water and fat-soluble.\\nAnd the fact that it can pass into so many organs and cells so easily is really what explains its damaging effects.\\nI should mention that there are three main types of alcohol.\\nThere's isopropyl, methyl, and ethyl alcohol.\\nAnd only the last one, ethyl alcohol or ethanol, is fit for human consumption.\\nHowever, it is still toxic, okay? It produces substantial stress and damage to cells.\\nI'd love to be able to tell you otherwise, but that's just a fact.\\nEthanol produces substantial damage to cells.\\nAnd it does that because when you ingest ethanol, it has to be converted into something else because it is toxic to the body.\\nAnd there's a molecule inside of all of us called NAD, and you may have heard of NAD because it's quite popular.\\nThere's a lot of discussion about NAD in the longevity literature right now.\\nNAD is present in all our cells from birth until death.\\nThe levels of NAD tend to go down across the lifespan.\\nThere are ideas that increasing levels of NAD may extend lifespan.\\nA lot of that is still controversial, or at least we should say is ongoing in terms of the research.\\nBut nonetheless, when you ingest ethanol, NAD and related biochemical pathways are involved in converting that ethanol into something called acetylaldehyde.\\nIt's broken down into acetylaldehyde.\\nAnd if you thought ethanol was bad, acetylaldehyde is particularly bad.\\nAcetylaldehyde is poison.\\nIt will kill cells.\\nIt damages and kills cells, and it is indiscriminate as to which cells it damages and kills.\\nNow, that's a problem, obviously, and the body deals with that problem by using another component of the NAD biochemical pathway to convert acetylaldehyde into something called acetate.\\nAcetate is actually something that your body can use as fuel.\\nAnd that process of going from ethanol to acetylaldehyde to acetate does involve the production of a toxic molecule, right? Again, acetylaldehyde is really toxic.\\nAnd NAD, and if we want to get technical, it's the NAD to NADH ratio.\\nAnd that chemical step is the rate-limiting step to ethanol's metabolism.\\nWhat does that mean for you? What that means is that if your body can't do this conversion of ethanol to acetylaldehyde to acetate fast enough, well, acetylaldehyde will build up in your body and cause more damage.\\nSo it's important that your body be able to do this conversion very quickly.\\nAnd the place where it does that is within the liver.\\nAnd cells within the liver are very good at this conversion process.\\nBut they are cells, and they are exposed to the acetylaldehyde in the conversion process.\\nAnd so cells within the liver really take a beating in the alcohol metabolism events.\\nSo the key thing to understand here is that when you ingest alcohol, you are, yes, ingesting a poison, and that poison is converted into an even worse poison in your body.\\nAnd some percentage of that worst poison is converted into a form of calories that you can use to generate energy, generate ATP.\\nAnd the reason why alcohol is considered empty calories is because that entire process is very metabolically costly, but there's no real nutritive value of the calories that it creates.\\nYou can use it for immediate energy, but it can't be stored in any kind of meaningful or beneficial way.\\nIt doesn't provide any vitamins.\\nIt doesn't provide any amino acids.\\nIt doesn't provide any fatty acids.\\nIt's truly empty calories.\\nI know some people talk about sugar is empty calories, but sugar actually is a far better fuel source than alcohol or acetate.\\nBut nonetheless, when you ingest alcohol, some percentage is being shuttled into a worse poison and some is being shuttled into a fuel source.\\nNow, the important thing to understand is that it is the poison, the acetal aldehyde itself, that leads to the effect of being inebriated or drunk.\\nI think most people don't realize that, that being drunk is actually a poison-induced disruption in the way that your neural circuits work.\\nAnd so we should ask ourselves which neural circuits, what brain areas, what body areas involved in feeling drunk or inebriated.\\nNow, in thinking about this state of being tipsy or happy or really drunk or a little bit drunk, I want to mention something I think most people aren't aware of.\\nAnd that's the fact that for people that are regular drinkers or that have a genetic predisposition to alcoholism, when they drink, they tend to feel very energized and very good for longer periods of time.\\nAgain, people who have a genetic predisposition to alcohol or people who are chronic drinkers or even just, if you recall, chronic doesn't have to mean a ton of alcohol but they're drinking one or two per night or they're every other night type drinkers or Thursday through Sunday drinkers.\\nThose people typically experience an increase in alertness and mood when they drink, whereas occasional drinkers will have a briefer, meaning less long-lasting period of feeling good when they drink and then more quickly transition into a state in which they're tired or they start losing motor skills, they start slurring their speech.\\nI also want to emphasize this is distinct from tolerance.\\nWe'll talk about tolerance later and exactly what tolerance means.\\nBut I really want to highlight the fact that when people ingest this poison, because indeed it is poison, the range of effects is very different and you can reliably predict who are the people with a predisposition to alcoholism and who are the people who are more regular drinkers by the contour, the timing of the different effects.\\nAnd again, people who tend to feel more alert and excited every time they drink, they tend to get a real lift.\\nThey become kind of the life of the party and that lasts a long while.\\nThose people are the ones that really have to be careful about predisposition for alcoholism.\\nAnd those people also need to be careful about their drinking and the amount of drinking that they're doing, even if they're not full-blown alcoholics.\\nNow, of course, people who are ingesting alcohol, who are not accustomed to drink alcohol have to be concerned about drinking alcohol for other reasons, because it can impair motor function and judgment, et cetera.\\nBut in thinking about the biochemical effects of alcohol and what it's doing to the body, what it's doing in all cases is it's consumed into the gut, goes into the stomach.\\nThe liver immediately starts this conversion that we talked about before of ethanol to acetaldehyde to acetate.\\nAnd some amount of acetaldehyde and acetate are making it into the brain.\\nIt crosses the blood-brain barrier.\\nAgain, the brain has this fence around it that we call the blood-brain barrier or the BBB.\\nMany things, most things, thankfully, can't pass across the blood-brain barrier, but alcohol, because it's water and fat soluble, just cruises right across this fence and into the milieu, the environment of the brain, which is made up of a couple of different major cell types, neurons, nerve cells, and so-called glial cells, which are in between the nerve cells.\\nAnd we'll talk about the effects on each of those soon.\\nSo what happens when alcohol gets into the brain that makes us feel tipsy or drunk, and in some people makes people feel really, especially energized and happy? Well, alcohol is indiscriminate in terms of which brain areas it goes to.\\nAgain, it doesn't bind to particular receptors, but it does seem to have a propensity or an affinity for particular brain areas that are involved in certain kinds of thinking and behavior.\\nSo one of the first things that happens is that there's a slight, at least after the first drink or second drink, there's a slight suppression in the activity of neurons in the prefrontal cortex.\\nThis is an area of your neocortex that's involved in thinking and planning, and perhaps above all, in suppression of impulsive behavior.\\nSo if you go to a party and they're serving alcohol and people are consuming drinks, what you'll notice is that a few minutes into that party, the volume of people's voices will increase.\\nAnd that's because people are simply not paying attention to their voice modulation.\\nAs other people start speaking more loudly, other people are speaking more loudly.\\nWe've all had this experience of going to a party and then you step outside for a moment and you go, oh my goodness, I was shouting.\\nYou come home the next day, you've got a sore throat.\\nIt might be that you picked up some sort of bug, some virus or something, but oftentimes it's just the fact you've been shouting all night just to be heard because as the prefrontal cortex shuts down, people stop modulating their level of speech quite as much.\\nAlso notice that people start gesticulating more.\\nPeople will start standing up and sitting down more.\\nThey'll start walking around more.\\nIf there's music on, people might spontaneously start dancing.\\nAll of this is because these areas of the prefrontal cortex normally are providing what's called top-down inhibition.\\nThey are releasing a neurotransmitter called GABA onto various parts of the brain.\\nThey're involved in impulsive motor behavior and thought patterns.\\nAnd as you shut down the prefrontal cortex, that GABA-ergic suppression of impulses starts to be released.\\nSo people will say things that they want to say without so much forethought about what they're saying.\\nOr they might do things that they want to do without really thinking it through quite as much or they might not even remember thinking it through at all or experience, I should say, thinking it through at all.\\nWe haven't talked about blacking out yet and the effects of alcohol on memory.\\nBut as long as we're there, I'll just tell you that alcohol has a very strong effect in suppressing the neural networks that are involved in memory formation and storage.\\nThis is why oftentimes we forget the events of a night out if we've been drinking.\\nOne of the more important things to know about the effects of alcohol in the brain is this disruption in top-down inhibition, but also that areas of the brain that are involved in flexible behavior, sort of considering different options.\\nLike I could do A or I could do B.\\nI could say this to them or I could say that.\\nI could say it in that way or I could say it in this way.\\nThis might be a little more tactful.\\nThose brain areas basically shut down entirely and people just tend to say what they want to say.\\nSo the key thing to understand is that when people drink, the prefrontal cortex and top-down inhibition is diminished.\\nThat is habitual behavior and impulsive behavior starts to increase.\\nNow, what's interesting is this is true in the short term.\\nSo after people have one or two, maybe three or four drinks, but it's also true that the more often that people drink, there are changes in the very circuits that underlie habitual and impulsive behavior.\\nOkay, this is really important to highlight so much so that I want to drill into it a little bit more deeply.\\nFor the person that drinks say every Thursday night or every Friday night or goes out only on Saturdays, but every Saturday, there's evidence that there are changes in the neural circuits of the brain that control habitual behavior and impulsive behavior.\\nAnd they are modified and strengthened in ways that make those people more habitual and more impulsive outside the times in which they are drinking.\\nAnd when they drink, impulsive and habitual behavior tends to increase even further.\\nThis is something that's not often talked about when discussing the effects of alcohol.\\nAnd we all know the effects of being drunk can be bad, can be bad in terms of judgment, motor coordination, certainly driving drunk is a terrible thing, get you or other people killed and so on.\\nBut rarely do we hear about the changes in neural circuits from just one or two nights of regular drinking.\\nAgain, chronic drinking doesn't necessarily mean every day and every night.\\nIt could be the person that simply drinks every Thursday or every Friday or just once a week has three or four drinks or maybe even a few more.\\nThat person is going to experience a decrease in this top-down inhibition.\\nSo an increase in impulsivity and habitual behavior because the break on those behaviors has been removed while they're drinking, but also changes in the very neural circuits that allow habitual and impulsive behavior to occur more readily even when they're not drinking.\\nAnd if you want to know the actual substrate for that, the seller substrate, I can briefly describe it.\\nIt's really interesting.\\nAgain, you don't need to know any biology to understand this.\\nWhat it does is it increases the number of synapses, the actual points of connection in the neural circuits that control habitual behavior.\\nSo there's literally a growth of the neural circuits in your brain that lead to existing habit execution, right? The performance of things you already know how to do and a reduction in the neural circuits, or I should say a reduction in the number of synapses of the contacts within the neural circuits that are controlling behavior.\\nSo this again is a not often discussed aspect of alcohol intake.\\nFortunately, it is reversible.\\nSo in animals or humans that undertake a period of abstinence of anywhere from two to six months, these neural circuits return to normal, except in cases where people have been chronically drinking large volumes of alcohol for many, many years.\\nAnd in those cases, while there is some recovery of brain circuitry after people get sober, meaning completely sober, they stop drinking entirely, there is evidence of long lasting impact of heavy alcohol usage throughout the lifespan.\\nBut of course, this doesn't mean that anyone that's suffering from alcoholism or that used to should not continue to focus on their health.\\nYou absolutely should, all is not lost.\\nBut for people that have been drinking for a lot of years, maybe you went to college and you drank a lot in those years and your neural circuits change.\\nIf there's a period in which you don't drink alcohol, again, from two to six months and ideally longer, those neural circuits can then be remodified back to their original state.\\nSo let's consider some of the other neurochemical effects of alcohol in the brain and body.\\nAnd again, for right now, we're confining the conversation to people that are drinking on average one or two drinks per night.\\nNow, some people might think that two drinks per night is a lot, and a lot of that will depend on body weight.\\nSo for instance, people who weigh 110 pounds, for them to ingest two alcoholic drinks is going to be substantially different in terms of the biochemical effects than somebody who weighs 220 pounds.\\nOf course, tolerance will also factor into this.\\nGenetic background will also factor into this.\\nAnd indeed, whether or not people have eaten will factor into this.\\nSo there are a lot of factors, and we'll talk about that.\\nFor the time being, if you're curious about how food impacts the effects of alcohol and your feelings of being drunk, you may have heard, for instance, that if somebody's inebriated and they want to sober up, they should eat something.\\nTurns out that does not work.\\nHere's how it does work, however.\\nIf you eat something prior to drinking alcohol or while ingesting alcohol, it will slow the absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream.\\nIn other words, you won't feel as drunk as fast.\\nFor many of you, this probably comes as no surprise.\\nIn particular, if that meal includes carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, okay? The inclusion of all three major macronutrients seems to slow the absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream far more than having any one of those or two of those macronutrients present.\\nNow, if you are already inebriated or you've had a glass of wine or a beer and you eat something, chances are that alcohol has already made it into your bloodstream because it moves into the bloodstream so quickly.\\nAgain, it's fat-soluble and water-soluble.\\nSo within minutes, if you have an empty stomach, within five to 10 minutes, that alcohol is going to be within your bloodstream and distributed throughout your body, maybe even faster depending on the type of alcohol and your metabolism.\\nBut if you're already drunk and you eat something, it's not going to sober you up more quickly, but it certainly will blunt the effects of any additional alcohol that you might consume.\\nAnd if you're somebody who is concerned about getting too drunk too quick, even from a small amount of alcohol, having some food in your gut can certainly be beneficial.\\nNow, that's food and alcohol and the absorption of alcohol, but let's go back to talking about the biochemical and neurochemical effects of alcohol in the brain.\\nWe talked about top-down inhibition and we talked about habitual and impulsive behavior circuitry.\\nThere are also dramatic changes in the activity of neurons that control the release of so-called serotonin.\\nSerotonin is a neuromodulator.\\nIt changes the activity of neural circuits and many neural circuits, in particular those involved in mood and feelings of wellbeing.\\nRecently, there's been a lot of interest in serotonin because of a study that was released that showed pretty conclusively that serotonin levels can't really explain depression and depression-like symptoms.\\nI want to make it very clear that although that study did show that serotonin levels are not necessarily associated with depression, the study was interpreted by many to mean that SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which have the net effect of increasing serotonin.\\nThese are things like Prozac, et cetera, that those drugs are somehow not helpful because they increase serotonin and serotonin isn't involved in depression.\\nThat logic doesn't really hold together so I'm going to use this as an opportunity to just clarify what really occurred there and then we'll talk about how serotonin relates to alcohol consumption in things like feeling good and in depression.\\nThe key thing is this, SSRIs can help alleviate depression.\\nThat's right, SSRIs can help alleviate depression.\\nThey are often not always associated with side effects, dosage is very important, et cetera, but they probably support relief from depression by changing neural circuits, not necessarily by increasing serotonin itself.\\nThat is, increasing serotonin with these drugs likely change the neural circuits involved in mood, allowing people to feel better through so-called neuroplasticity, which is the brain's ability to change itself in response to experience.\\nSo there's a bit of confusion and again, I'm using this episode on alcohol to highlight some of the confusion because I think it's timely because the study just came out and there's a lot of chatter about this out there that when people are depressed, it's not necessarily because serotonin levels are low.\\nHowever, if serotonin levels are increased with things like Prozac, Zoloft and other SSRIs, oftentimes there is, yes, a relief from depression, but that's probably not because of restoring serotonin levels per se, it's probably because serotonin facilitates the changes in neural circuits that need to occur in order for people to feel elevated mood, okay? So again, that's a bit of a tangent and a side, but I do think it's a vital one for people to know about.\\nAgain, if you're thinking about taking SSRIs, you're currently taking them and you've heard this news, definitely talk to your doctor.\\nAgain, there is great utility for some of these SSRIs and also in conditions like OCD, they've been shown to be very beneficial.\\nSo we really don't want to throw SSRIs out as a potentially valuable treatment.\\nGetting back to the effects of alcohol on serotonin, it's very clear beyond any doubt that many of the circuits in the brain that are involved in mood and feelings of wellbeing and also sort of self-image in how we see ourselves employ the neuromodulator serotonin and alcohol when we ingest it and it's converted into acetylalbohyd, it goes and that acetylalbohyd acts as a toxin at the very synapses, the connections between the serotonergic neurons and lots of other neurons.\\nIn other words, when we ingest alcohol, the toxic effects of alcohol disrupt those mood circuitries at first making them hyperactive.\\nThat's right, making them hyperactive.\\nThis is why people become really talkative.\\nPeople start to feel really good after a few sips of alcohol, at least most people do.\\nAnd then as they ingest more alcohol or as that alcohol wears off, serotonin levels and the activity of those circuits really starts to drop.\\nAnd that's why people feel less good.\\nAnd typically what they do, they go and get another drink and they attempt to kind of restore that feeling of wellbeing and mood.\\nNow, typically what happens is that as people ingest the third and fourth, maybe even the fifth drink, there's an absolute zero chance of them recovering that energized mood, right? Most people as they drink more and more will now start to feel more and more suppressed.\\nThe forebrain is now shutting down quite a lot.\\nA lot of the motor cortical areas that control coordinated movement and deliberate movement start to shut down.\\nSo people start to slur their speech.\\nPeople start to shuffle their feet.\\nPeople forget their posture.\\nPeople start to lean on things.\\nPeople start passing out on couches.\\nThere's a great depression, not depression of the psychiatric depression sort, but a depression of alertness and arousal.\\nAnd eventually people will pass out.\\nNow, I said most people because there's a subset of people that have gene variants or who are chronic drinkers or who are chronic drinkers and have gene variants that as they ingest the third and fourth and fifth drink, what happens? They become more alert.\\nThey start talking more.\\nThey feel great.\\nThey have all sorts of ideas about the fun they could have that night.\\nAnd they're the ones that if you've ever fallen asleep at a party for whatever reason, or you're getting tired and you're yawning and you're looking around the room and like these people are still drinking and partying and they're having what seems to be this amazing time, often not always, those are the future alcoholics in the room, or those are the people that have a genetic predisposition for alcoholism, or those are the chronic drinkers, the people who have built up enough of a tolerance or who have the chemical genetic makeup such that increasing amounts of alcohol make them feel better and better and better.\\nAnd of course, they too have a threshold beyond which their nervous system will start to get diminished and they'll pass out and fall over, et cetera.\\nBut that threshold is way, way higher than it is for most people.\\nNow, this is important to understand.\\nAnd it's important to understand because I think everyone should know and recognize their own predisposition and kind of risk in terms of developing alcoholism.\\nIt's also important to understand because it relates to the phenomenon of blackout.\\nMany people think that blacking out is passing out, but blackout drunk is when people drink and they're talking and doing things.\\nSometimes sadly, or tragically, they'll often drive home or walk home or they'll hop on a bicycle and ride home or they'll go swimming in the ocean, all of course, very dangerous activities to do when people are really drunk or even a little bit drunk in some cases.\\nSo these people will do these sorts of things and they do them because they have the energy to do them and they feel good while doing them, but they are doing them while the activity of neurons in the hippocampus, which is involved in memory formation, are completely shut off.\\nAnd this is why the next day you tell them, hey, maybe we should talk about what happened last night.\\nLike, what happened last night? You said, well, do you remember going to the party? Yeah, no, it was great.\\nWe did this, we did this, and then what? And it's very clear all of a sudden that they have no recollection of all the things they were doing despite being awake.\\nNow, I wish I could tell you that there's some sort of blood test or other biomarker, even a fingerprint test that would allow you to determine whether or not you have a propensity to be one of these drinkers that has a predisposition for alcoholism.\\nAnd if you've ever been blackout drunk, and certainly if you've been blackout drunk more than a few times, you should be quite concerned.\\nAnd as we talk more about the more chronic effects and long-lasting effects of alcohol consumption a little bit later in the episode, I think it will become clear as to why you should be concerned.\\nBut in any case, there is something that can tell you whether or not you might be in that category versus likely not in that category.\\nAnd I alluded to this a couple of times already, but I want to be really clear that when people drink, no matter who you are, initially there's that shutting down of those prefrontal cortical circuits.\\nThere's a gradual shutting down of the circuits that control memory, but then people divide into these two bins.\\nAnd these two bins are the people who after more than a couple of drinks start to feel sedated, and the people who after more than a few drinks do not start to feel sedated.\\nNow, of course, there's going to be differences created by how quickly people are drinking, whether or not they're combining different types of alcohol, the types of alcohol, et cetera.\\nBut in general, that can predict whether or not you're somebody who has a predisposition for alcoholism or not.\\nOne also very interesting finding is that alcohol changes the relationship between what's called the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland and the adrenals.\\nNow, the hypothalamus is a small collection of neurons about the size of a large gumball sits above the roof of your mouth, and it houses neurons that are responsible for some incredible aspects of our behavior and our mindset.\\nThings like rage, things like sex drive, things like temperature regulation, very primitive functions, including appetite, thirst, et cetera.\\nAlcohol, because it can go anywhere in the brain, remember it's water and fat-soluble, has effects on the hypothalamus.\\nThe hypothalamus normally provides very specific signals to what's called the pituitary gland.\\nThis is a little gland that actually sticks out of the brain, but it receives instructions from the hypothalamus.\\nAnd then the pituitary releases hormones into the bloodstream that go and talk to your adrenals.\\nYour adrenal glands sit right above your kidneys in your lower back.\\nAnd the adrenals release, as the name suggests, adrenaline, also called epinephrine, and also a molecule called cortisol, which is involved in the kind of longer-term stress response and has some healthy effects too on the immune system.\\nOkay, so the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, I know that's a mouthful, you don't need to remember the names, but the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis maintains your physiological balance of what you perceive as stressful and what you don't perceive as stressful.\\nPeople who drink regularly, so this again could be just one or two drinks per night, or it could be somebody that drinks just on Fridays or just on Saturdays or maybe just on the weekend, two to four drinks.\\nWell, those people experience changes in their hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that result in more cortisol, more of this so-called stress hormone being released at baseline when they are not drinking.\\nThis is really important.\\nPeople who drink a bit, and when I say a bit, I don't mean one or two sips or even a glass of wine every once in a while.\\nI mean, again, people that are maybe having one drink a night with dinner and maybe on the weekend a few more.\\nAgain, I offer a bunch of different patterns to explain how it could also be two or three drinks on Friday or six drinks only on Saturday.\\nWell, all of those groups experience increases in cortisol release from their adrenal glands when they are not drinking.\\nAnd as a consequence, they feel more stressed and more anxiety when they aren't drinking.\\nThis is a seldom talked about effect of alcohol because so often we hear about the immediate effects of alcohol, right? And we've been talking about some of those effects.\\nEffects like reducing the amount of stress.\\nI mean, how many times have we heard somebody say, oh, I need a drink.\\nAnd then they have a drink and they're like, calm down.\\nNow they can shake off the thoughts about the day's work.\\nThey can start to think about things in a maybe more grounded or rational way, or at least they believe that, or they can somehow just relax themselves.\\nWell, while that very well may be true that it can relax them when they are not drinking, that level of cortisol that's released at baseline has increased substantially.\\nAgain, this relates to a defined neural circuit between brain and body.\\nAnd it has to do with the ratio of cortisol to some of the other hormones involved in the stress response.\\nWe'll provide a reference to the study that describes how all of this works for those of you that really want to delve into it.\\nBut let's go back to this issue of those who are prone to alcoholism versus those who are not.\\nRemember, there are people who have genetic variants that meaning genes that they inherited from their parents that make it more likely that they will become alcoholics.\\nBut there are also people who drink often who start to experience this increase in alertness the longer they drink across the night.\\nPart of that effect we think is because of changes in this hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.\\nSo alcohol is kind of a double hit in this sense.\\nIt's causing changes in our brain circuitry and neurochemistry that at the time in which we're inebriated are detrimental.\\nAnd it's causing changes in neural circuitry that persist long past the time in which we're experiencing the feeling of being tipsy or drunk.\\nNow, again, I don't want to demonize alcohol.\\nI'm not saying, oh, you know, if you have a glass of wine now and again, or you drink a beer now and again, or even have, you know, a mixed drink now and again, or a shot, that that's necessarily terrible for you.\\nI certainly do not want that to be the message.\\nWhat I'm saying is that if people are ingesting alcohol chronically, even if it's not every night, there are well-recognized changes in neural circuits, there are well-recognized changes in neurochemistry within the brain, and there are well-recognized changes in the brain-to-body stress system that generally point in three directions, increased stress when people are not drinking, diminished mood and feelings of wellbeing when people are not drinking, and as you'll soon learn, changes in the neural circuitry that cause people to want to drink even more in order to get just back to baseline where the place that they were in terms of their stress modulation and in terms of their feelings of mood before they ever started drinking in the first place.\\nSo again, I don't want to demonize alcohol, but I do want to emphasize that there are long-term plastic changes, meaning changes in neural circuitry and hormone circuitry that across a period of several months and certainly across a period of years of the sorts of drinking patterns I described, which I think for most people are going to sound like pretty typical, right? I mean, nothing that I described so far was about drinking a case a night or about binging on alcohol in the way that we often hear about it in the news.\\nThese are pretty common patterns of alcohol consumption.\\nI mean, all you have to do is board a transatlantic flight or actually go to an airport on a Sunday afternoon in a sunny area of the US, and people are having three, four, five, six beers, et cetera.\\nAgain, personal choice is personal choice.\\nI'm not telling you what to do, but it's very clear that those sorts of drinking patterns are changing neural circuitry and they're changing hormone circuitry.\\nAnd I'd love to be able to tell you that they're changing them for the better, but they simply are not.\\nThey're actually changing them for the worse.\\nAnd worse is defined as making people less resilient to stress, higher levels of baseline stress, and lower mood overall.\\nBefore we continue with today's discussion, I'd like to just briefly acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens, now called AG1.\\nAthletic Greens, AKA AG1, is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also has adaptogens and digestive enzymes.\\nI've been taking Athletic Greens since way back in 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.\\nThe reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still drink Athletic Greens twice a day is that it supplies total foundational coverage of my vitamin mineral needs, and it supplies important nutrients that I need to support my gut microbiome.\\nThe gut microbiome, as many of you know, supports the immune system.\\nIt also supports the so-called gut brain axis, which is vital for mood, for energy levels, for regulating focus, and many other features of our mental health and physical health that impact our daily performance and high performance in any endeavors we might be involved in.\\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman and claim a special offer.\\nThey're giving away five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2 with every order.\\nAnd of course, vitamin D3K2 are vital for all sorts of things like hormone health and metabolic health, and K2 for cardiovascular health and calcium regulation.\\nAgain, you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman to claim that special offer.\\nNow, I've been talking a little bit about genetic predisposition, but there are a couple of important points I'd like to make about that.\\nFirst of all, what sorts of genes are involved in setting someone down the path of alcoholism or not? Well, it should come as no surprise that the genes that chronic alcohol usage modifies, they tend to fall primarily in the pathways related to genetic control over serotonin receptors, GABA receptors, remember that top-down inhibition and the involvement of GABA, and no surprise, the HPA, the hypothalamic pituitary axis.\\nAll of those, of course, combine with environment, they combine with patterns of abuse, right? We know that if you're in a social setting where a lot of people are drinking, the likelihood that you're going to drink is much higher, social pressures, trauma, right? Some people will use alcohol to self-medicate to try and turn off their thinking or to deal with trauma, et cetera.\\nSo they combine with the environment, but the genes that are in the serotonin synthesis and receptor synthesis pathway, GABA and HPA axis, combine with environmental pressures to give rise to alcohol use disorders.\\nSo there's a fairly coherent picture that we have here, right? This is not a case where, for instance, people that have a lot of the enzyme for metabolizing alcohol, which we'll talk about in a minute, alcohol dehydrogenase, it's not like they are necessarily the people that become alcoholics, whereas certainly in certain cultures, certain Asian cultures in particular, there are gene differences that lead them to have low levels of alcohol dehydrogenase.\\nThere are actually people who have so little alcohol dehydrogenase that when they ingest alcohol, they get very red and they just feel sick.\\nSo if you're somebody that has a sip of alcohol and you just feel horrible, it makes you feel nauseous.\\nChances are you have gene variants that create a situation where you're not making very much alcohol dehydrogenase.\\nYou just simply can't metabolize alcohol.\\nSo you just get a rapid buildup of the toxic effects of alcohol, the acetyl aldehyde.\\nYou're not converting it into those empty calories.\\nBut in cultures where you have a lot of genetic variants and genes expressed in people where they have a lot of alcohol dehydrogenase, sure, they can drink more and they're converting more of that alcohol from its toxic form to a non-toxic form.\\nAnd yes, of course, you will observe more alcoholism in those communities because they're drinking more.\\nBut I do want to emphasize that the environmental factors are playing a strong role there too, because if you can drink more, you're likely to drink more.\\nIf you're somebody that feels sick immediately from drinking, it's likely that you're not going to engage in alcohol consumption, especially if these things are genetically related.\\nAnd of course, genes and culture and location in the world tend to run together.\\nSo do you have the gene for alcoholism? Well, there isn't one single gene.\\nChances are if you have an immediate relative who's a chronic abuser of alcohol or several relatives who are chronic abusers of alcohol, well, that's going to predispose you to be an alcoholic.\\nBut since you don't know which genes you express, unless you do genetic testing and those things are available, but most people aren't doing that, this assay, if you will, it's not an assay, as we say, an assay is a test that you run in the lab to determine something.\\nAnd it's not one that I recommend that you go drink in order to do.\\nBut if you've noticed that you or somebody else is somebody who can drink a lot throughout the night and have increased energy, you can just drink and drink and drink.\\nAnd especially if there's blackout episodes, not remembering things the next day, despite being alert throughout the entire night and so on, well, then I would be very concerned that you might actually have a genetic variant predisposing you to alcoholism.\\nThe other thing that predisposes people to abuse of alcohol is age.\\nPeople who start drinking at younger ages are greatly predisposed to developing alcohol dependence, regardless of your family history of alcoholism.\\nOkay, so I'm going to repeat that.\\nPeople who start drinking younger are at great risk for developing alcoholism, even if they don't have alcoholism in their family.\\nNow, of course, you don't have to be an epidemiologist to understand that if you grow up in a family of drinkers and alcohol is everywhere, and especially if there's peer pressure or lack of oversight, then there's going to be a higher tendency or a higher probability, I should say, that you will start drinking at a younger age.\\nHowever, even people that grow up nowhere near their relatives, if they start drinking at a young age, so for instance, at 13 or younger or 14 or 15, there's a much higher probability that they're going to develop a long-lasting dependence on alcohol.\\nPeople who take their first sip of alcohol later, 15, 16, or one would hope even later, I can say one would hope, because I'm now of that age and generation where you think about all the things that young people do and you go, oh gosh, if they only would wait, or if they only would abstain, you know, so it's what happens.\\nI don't know, there's some neural circuit for that that I can't explain yet.\\nBut people who, for instance, drink only once they reach legal age of drinking, which in the US, I believe in every state is 21 years old, if they take their first drink at 21, the probability that they'll go on to develop full-blown alcohol dependence or alcohol use disorder, as it's called, AUD, is very low.\\nNow, a subset of them will because they have such a strong genetic predisposition where maybe life circumstances create a pattern in which they become a chronic drinker.\\nBut I found this very interesting.\\nGenes matter, but also the age in which somebody starts drinking really matters.\\nNow, whether or not that's because there are changes in neural circuitry as a consequence of that drinking, that make people want to seek out more and more alcohol, or whether or not there's some other effect, maybe it's a change in hormones, et cetera, that predisposes those young drinkers to become chronic drinkers or even full-blown alcoholics, certainly developing alcohol use disorder.\\nThere's definition for that.\\nWe can talk about it.\\nIt involves the amount of drinking over a certain period of time, et cetera.\\nSo it's very clear that drinking early in life creates a propensity for the development of alcohol use disorder later in life.\\nAnd while there is a genetic component to developing alcohol use disorder, I find it very interesting that if people who have those gene variants delay their onset of drinking, well, then the probability that they'll develop full-blown alcohol use disorder drops as well.\\nSo again, it's genes and environments, not an either or, and there's no single gene for alcoholism.\\nWell, I promise you I will also talk about some of the documented positive effects of alcohol, although they are very few and far between.\\nThey do exist.\\nBut before I do that, I would be remiss if I didn't emphasize some more of the terrible things that alcohol does and the way that it does it.\\nAnd for those of you that enjoy alcohol, again, I really like to say I feel guilty about telling you this because I know how much some people enjoy a good drink every once in a while.\\nAnd I say a good drink because some people do like the taste of alcohol.\\nI suppose I lucked out in that I don't really like the taste of alcohol and that just puts me to sleep, but I know that people do enjoy it.\\nAnd I do want to point out that there is zero evidence that provided somebody is of drinking age or certainly not in the stage of brain development that having one drink or two drinks every now and again, meaning every three or four weeks or once a month, that is not going to cause major health concerns or major health issues for most people.\\nI suppose if you have zero or very little alcohol dehydrogenates, it might make you feel sick, but then you're probably not the kind of person that's going to be drinking at all.\\nSo again, if you enjoy alcoholic drinks, I'm not trying to take them away from you by any means, but you should know what drinking does if you're consuming it in this kind of typical chronic pattern as we can now refer to it, which is that one or two a night or a few stacked up on Friday and maybe three or four on Saturday, this kind of pattern of drinking, which is quite common.\\nAnd one of the more serious effects that we should think about is the impact on the so-called gut-brain axis, or for sake of today's discussion, the gut-liver-brain axis.\\nI don't think the gut-liver-brain axis has ever been discussed on this podcast, maybe any podcast, although at the moment I say that, I'm going to, you know, the gut-liver-brain axis, people are going to come after me with, I suppose, gut-liver-brain and brains.\\nIn any event, you have a brain, you have a gut, that gut runs from your throat down to the end of your intestine.\\nYour gut and your brain communicate by way of nerve cells, neurons and nerve connections, the vagus nerve in particular, and by way of chemical signaling.\\nYour gut also communicates by way of chemical signaling, and believe it or not, by way of neural signaling to your liver.\\nAnd as we talked about earlier, the liver is the first site in which alcohol is broken down and metabolized into its component parts.\\nThe liver is also communicating with the brain through chemical signaling and neural signaling.\\nSo we have the gut-liver-brain axis.\\nAnd what you find is that people who ingest alcohol at any amount are inducing a disruption in the so-called gut microbiome, the trillions of little micro bacteria that take resident in your gut and that live inside you all the time and that helps support your immune system and that literally signal by way of electrical signals and chemical signals to your brain to increase the release of things like serotonin and dopamine and regulate your mood, generally in positive ways.\\nWell, alcohol really disrupts those bacteria.\\nAnd this should come as no surprise.\\nI mean, earlier we talked about this and it's well known.\\nIf you want to sterilize something, you want to kill the bacteria, you pour alcohol on it.\\nAnd I can remember scraping myself or cutting myself.\\nI was always injuring myself when I was a kid.\\nAnd the moment they take out the peroxide, you're like, oh boy, here it comes.\\nBut if there's no peroxide around and you've got a wound there and you need to clean it out, yeah, they'll use alcohol, which I do not recommend by the way.\\nAnd that's one of the harshest ways to clean a wound.\\nBut for centuries, thousands of years really, alcohol has been used in order to clean things and kill bacteria.\\nSo alcohol kills bacteria and it is indiscriminate with respect to which bacteria it kills.\\nSo when we ingest alcohol and it goes into our gut, it kills a lot of the healthy gut microbiota.\\nAt the same time, the metabolism of alcohol in the liver, which you now understand that pathway involving NAD, acetylaldehyde and acetate, that pathway is pro-inflammatory.\\nSo it's increasing the release of inflammatory cytokines, things like IL-6, et cetera, tumor necrosis factor alpha.\\nIf you'd like to learn more about the immune system, we did an episode all about the immune system.\\nYou can find it at hubermanlab.com.\\nI'll teach you all the basics of what are cytokines, what are mast cells, et cetera.\\nIn any event, all these pro-inflammatory molecules, those are being released.\\nYou've now got disruption of the gut microbiota.\\nAs a consequence, the lining of the gut is disrupted and you develop at least transiently leaky gut.\\nThat is bacteria that exists in the gut, which are bad bacteria, can now pass out of the gut into the bloodstream.\\nSo you've got a two hit kind of model here.\\nIn biology, we talk about two hit models that is kind of a one plus one equals four.\\nAnd it's generally when you hear two hit, it's not a good thing.\\nSo you've got bad bacteria from partially broken down food moving out of the gut.\\nThe good bacteria in the gut have been killed.\\nYou might say, why doesn't the alcohol kill the bad bacteria in the gut? Well, the bad bacteria that are from partially digested food oftentimes escape the gut before the alcohol can disrupt them.\\nAnd so now you've got leaks in the gut wall.\\nYou've got the release of this bad bacteria.\\nYou've got inflammatory cytokines and other things being released from the liver.\\nAnd they are able to get into the brain through what's called a neuroimmune signaling.\\nAnd what's really bizarre in terms of the way that this manifests in the brain.\\nI mean, it's not the way I would have done it, but then again, as I always say, I wasn't consulted at the design phase and anyone who says they did, you should be very skeptical of them.\\nThe net effect of this is actually to disrupt the neural circuits that control regulation of alcohol intake.\\nAnd the net effect of that is increased alcohol consumption.\\nSo this is just terrible, right? I mean, you take in something that disrupts two systems, the gut microbiota, and it disrupts in two ways.\\nIt's killing the good gut microbiota and it's allowing the bad bacteria to move from the gut into the bloodstream.\\nYou've also got pro-inflammatory cytokines coming from the liver and those converge or arrive in the brain and create a system in which the neural circuits cause more drinking.\\nThat's a bad situation.\\nAnd this is why people who drink regularly, even if it's not a ton of alcohol, again, of the sorts of patterns of drinking I talked about before, and certainly for those that are chronic heavy drinkers, what you end up with is a situation in which you have inflammation in multiple places in the brain and body and the desire to drink even more and to further exacerbate that inflammation and the gut leakiness.\\nSo this is basically a terrible scenario for the gut liver brain axis.\\nAnd it's especially prevalent in so-called alcohol use disorder.\\nAgain, people that are ingesting somewhere between 12 and 24 drinks per week.\\nFor those of you that are interested in learning more about the gut liver brain axis and in particular alcohol use disorder, I'll provide a link in the show note captions.\\nNow there's a wonderful review on this that details that.\\nBut on the positive side, it points to the possibility that at least some, again, at least some of the negative effects of alcohol consumption, whether or not you're somebody who's currently ingesting alcohol or who used to ingest alcohol and is trying to so-called repair these systems of the brain and body, whether or not replenishing the gut microbiota is going to be beneficial.\\nAnd we know that there are ways to do that.\\nAnd we know that there's at least some promise for the ability for the system to repair itself.\\nHow does one do that? Well, I've talked before about this on the podcast, but studies done by colleagues of mine at Stanford, Justin Sonnenberg, who's been on this podcast as a guest, an amazing episode all about the gut microbiome and his collaborator, Chris Garner, also at Stanford School of Medicine, have explored not alcoholism, but what are ways to improve the gut microbiota in particular to reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines and to adjust what's called the inflammatory.\\nYou've heard of the genome and the proteome, et cetera.\\nWell, the inflammatory is the total array or at least the near total array of genes and proteins that control inflammation.\\nHow can you reduce inflammation and make that inflammatory healthier? Well, they've shown that two to four servings of fermented foods per day.\\nAnd here I'm not referring to fermented alcohol.\\nI'm talking about low sugar fermented foods.\\nSo things like kimchi, sauerkraut, natto, for those of you that like Japanese food.\\nThere are others, I know things like kefir, things like yogurts that have a lot of active bacteria, again, low sugar varieties of all these things.\\nThose are terrific at reducing inflammatory markers and at improving the gut microbiome.\\nOne could imagine that either inoculating oneself from some of the effects of alcohol, although I'd prefer that people just not drink alcohol chronically, frankly, or if somebody's trying to repair their gut microbiome because they ingested a lot of alcohol or because they had a lot of these inflammatory cytokines for many years or even a short period of time, regular ingestion of two to four servings of these fermented foods can be quite beneficial.\\nI want to make it clear that has not been examined specifically in the context of alcohol use disorder, but because a huge component of the negative effects of alcohol use disorder are based in this gut liver brain access and disruption of the gut microbiome and the inflammatory cytokines, it stands to reason that things that are well established to improve inflammation status, in other words, reduce inflammation, such as ingesting two to four servings of low sugar fermented foods per day, makes sense in terms of trying to repair or replenish the system.\\nOne could also imagine taking probiotics or prebiotics.\\nCertainly that would work as well, although I've sort of favored the discussion around fermented foods and replenishment of the gut microbiome, mostly because there are more studies that have examined that in humans and because of the direct relationship that's been established between doing that and reducing negative markers within the inflammatory.\\nAnd I should mention along the lines of repair and recovery, I put out a question on Twitter the other day.\\nI said, what do you want to know about alcohol? I got more than a thousand questions.\\nI'll take some more of those questions a little later in the episode.\\nBut one of the things I noticed is that many of the questions, hundreds in fact, related to the question of, well, if I drank a lot previously, am I doomed? Can I reverse the negative effects? Or I'm trying to drink less and I'm trying to improve my health as I do that.\\nWhat should I do? Well, certainly focusing a bit on the gut microbiome ought to be useful.\\nThe other thing I should mention is as people wean themselves off alcohol, even if they're not full-blown alcoholics or have alcohol use disorder, they should understand that increase in cortisol that we talked about earlier, that leads to lower stress threshold and greater feelings of anxiety and stress, that's going to be present and it's going to take some time to dissipate.\\nSo for some people, it might even just be helpful to realize that as you try and wean yourself off alcohol or maybe even go cold turkey, that increased anxiety and feelings of stress should be expected.\\nAnd in that case, I would point you to an episode that we did on master stress.\\nYou can find that again at hubermanlab.com.\\nIt's got a ton of behavioral, nutritional, supplementation-based, exercise-based, I suppose exercise is behavioral, but a lot of tools, you can navigate to those easily because we have timestamps, you can go right to the topic of interest.\\nThose tools are going to be very useful in trying to clamp or control your stress.\\nAnd the point here is just that some increase in stress should be expected and it should be expected because of that increase in cortisol that occurs with even low-level consumption yet chronic alcohol consumption.\\nNow I'd like to talk about a fairly common phenomenon, which is post-alcohol consumption malaise, also referred to as hangover.\\nHangover is a constellation of effects ranging from headache to nausea to what's sometimes called anxiety, which is anxiety that follows a day of drinking.\\nAnxiety, I think we can understand physiologically if we think about that process of alcohol intake increasing the amount of cortisol and the ratio of cortisol to some other stress hormones.\\nThat well explains why some people wake up the day after or even the day after a night drinking and feel anxious and not well and stressed for reasons they don't understand.\\nSo if you're somebody who experiences anxiety, then again, I refer you to the master stress episode that we put out some time ago and you can find that at hubermanlab.com.\\nTools to deal with anxiety, tools to deal with stress ranging again from behavioral to nutritional, supplement-based, et cetera.\\nThat of course is not justification for going out and drinking so much that you get anxiety induced hangover.\\nBut for those of you that are experiencing post-alcohol consumption anxiety, as it were, that could be a useful resource because I certainly don't want anyone experiencing uncomfortable amounts of anxiety.\\nAnd there are great tools and resources for that.\\nNow, the other aspects of hangover, such as the stomach ache or headache or feelings of malaise or fogginess, those can be related to a number of different things and probably are related to a number of different things.\\nFirst of all, the sleep that one gets after even just one, yes, even just one glass of wine or a beer is not the same sleep that you get when you don't have alcohol circulating in your system.\\nAnd not trying to be a downer here, but this was discussed in the Huberman Lab podcast episode where I had Dr. Matthew Walker from UC Berkeley on.\\nAnd of course, Dr. Walker is a world expert in sleep, runs one of the preeminent laboratories studying sleep and its effects, wrote the incredible book, Why We Sleep, and so on.\\nDr. Walker told me, and it certainly is supported by lots and lots of quality peer-reviewed studies in animals and in humans, that when alcohol is present in the brain and bloodstream, that the architecture of sleep is disruptive.\\nSlow wave sleep, deep sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep, all of which are essential for getting a restorative night's sleep are all disrupted.\\nSo for those of you that are drinking a glass or two of wine or having a hard liquor drink or a beer in order to fall asleep, the sleep you're getting is simply not high quality sleep or certainly not as high quality as the sleep you'd be getting if you did not have alcohol in your system.\\nOf course, when we're talking about hangover, we're talking generally about the consumption of more than just one or two drinks.\\nOf course, for some people, one or two drinks is probably sufficient to induce hangover, but for most people, it's going to be having three or four, exceeding their typical limit, as it's called.\\nAgain, not the legal limit, that's a whole other business.\\nBut when one ingests too much alcohol for them, one of the reasons they feel terrible the next day is because their sleep isn't really good sleep.\\nIn fact, it's not even sleep, it's often considered pseudo sleep, or at least that's what it's called in the sleep science field, because people are in kind of a low level hypnotic kind of trance, it's not real sleep, there are multiple bouts of waking up, they may not even realize they're waking up multiple times.\\nOkay, so there's the sleep-induced effects.\\nThen there are the disrupted gut microbiome effects, some of which we talked about earlier, so now you understand the mechanism of alcohol destroying good, healthy gut microbiota, which then leads to leaky gut and things of that sort.\\nBut one could imagine, again, could imagine, and there is some evidence starting to support this, that again, ingesting low sugar fermented foods or maybe in prebiotic or probiotics to support the gut microbiome might assist in some of the gut related malaise associated with hangover.\\nIn other words, get those gut microbiota healthy again, as quickly as possible, or maybe even before you drink, have those gut microbiota healthy, I would hope that you would do that.\\nI think everybody should be doing something to support their gut microbiome, whether or not it's the ingestion of low sugar fermented foods daily, or at least on a regular basis, or ingestion of probiotic or prebiotic.\\nThe gut microbiome is so important for so many different things.\\nIn terms of hangover and headache, we know that that's caused by vasoconstriction, the constriction of blood vessels that tends to occur as a rebound after a night of drinking.\\nAlcohol can act as a vasodilator, it can dilate the blood vessels.\\nPart of that is associated with the increase in so-called parasympathetic tone.\\nWe have an autonomic nervous system, it's got a sympathetic component.\\nThese are neurons that make us more alert, and if they're very active, they make us very stressed.\\nThere's also the parasympathetic aspect of the autonomic nervous system.\\nThis is all just fancy geek speak for the parts of your brain and body, the nerve cells that make you very relaxed.\\nWhen you're very relaxed, there tends to be vasodilation.\\nIt allows for more movement of blood and other things through the bloodstream, and alcohol tends to induce some vasodilation, at least in some of the capillary beds.\\nAnd then when the alcohol wears off, there's vasoconstriction, and people get brutal headaches.\\nThat's why some people will take aspirin or Tylenol, or Advil, or things like that, the sort of non-steroid anti-inflammatories.\\nI should mention, there's a lot of literature coming out that some of these non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs are not good for us for a number of different reasons, the way they impact the liver, the way they impact the immune system, and, no surprise, the way they impact the gut microbiome.\\nSo I'm not one to tell you what medications to take or not take, but you certainly would want to do a quick web search of effects of non-steroid anti-inflammatories and aspirin before you start taking those, or stop taking those for that matter.\\nGenerally, they will alleviate headache, but they can often have other issues, including liver issues.\\nAnd keep in mind, the night after drinking, your liver has already taken a beating because of the need of the liver to convert alcohol from acetylaldehyde into acetate, which is now a pathway that you well understand.\\nSo I'm not certain, and in fact, I believe it's not the greatest idea to burden your liver further through the use of things that are going to cause it to have to work harder and metabolize things if the goal is simply to alleviate a headache.\\nThere's a lot of kind of lore, old school lore about how to relieve a hangover.\\nWe already talked about how eating food won't do that, but eating food will prevent the rapid absorption of even more alcohol into the bloodstream.\\nThere's the lore that one should simply ingest more alcohol.\\nWhat terrible advice that is.\\nThat's just going to delay an even worse hangover.\\nHowever, I'd be remiss if I didn't say that the reason that that myth came to be, or that I should say that truth came to be, because indeed ingesting more alcohol will alleviate a hangover, but then a worse hangover will show up.\\nThe reason that came to be is because ingestion more alcohol will cause those constricted vessels that are giving the headache to dilate again.\\nBut of course, ingesting more alcohol to relieve a hangover is simply a bad idea.\\nJust don't do it.\\nI think this is called the hair of the dog approach.\\nMaybe someone can put in the show note captions on YouTube, why it's called the hair of the dog.\\nI can come up with a few ideas, but they're not going to be very good ones.\\nAnd some of them would probably even be outright ridiculous.\\nSo do not ingest more alcohol simply to try and recover from a hangover.\\nI know many people have tried that one before, but that's a terrible idea.\\nNow, one thing that you'll also hear out there is that deliberate cold exposure, for instance, taking a cold shower might relieve hangover.\\nI find this one particularly interesting because we've done episodes on the benefits of deliberate cold exposure.\\nWe have an entire episode about that.\\nYou can find it again, hubermanlab.com.\\nThere are direct links to some of the tools related to deliberate cold exposure.\\nAnd we have an entire newsletter on deliberate cold exposure protocols.\\nYou can find on hubermanlab.com, go to our neural network newsletter.\\nSo those of you that are interested in ice baths and cold showers and ways to leverage those, you can find that there.\\nWhat you won't find there is a description of how to use deliberate cold exposure for sake of treating hangover.\\nBut here I went into the literature and I found something kind of interesting.\\nThere is some evidence that increasing levels of epinephrine in the bloodstream can actually help with alcohol clearance.\\nThat was very surprising to me.\\nAnd I want to point out this is not a large and robust literature, but there's some evidence pointing to the fact that when levels of epinephrine, adrenaline are raised in the brain and bloodstream, that some of the components of alcohol metabolism can be accelerated and some of the inebriating effects of alcohol can be reduced.\\nSo maybe this old school lore of taking a cold shower actually has something to it.\\nSo in thinking about the use of deliberate cold exposure in order to reduce the effects of hangover or to more rapidly clear alcohol from the brain and bloodstream, I want to be very clear and I want to emphasize your safety.\\nThe way to do that is to understand that alcohol lowers core body temperature, okay? It can make people slightly hypothermic.\\nIt's going to drop core body temperature.\\nSo if you were inebriated and you went and got into a body of water, right? A pool or a lake or something, first of all, that's extremely dangerous to do while you're inebriated, right? People drown all the time.\\nPeople drown, they die as a consequence of doing that.\\nSo please don't do that.\\nBut also if it's a very cold water, your core body temperature is going to drop even further.\\nNow, if you've heard the episodes that I've done on deliberate cold exposure, previously I've talked about how normally when people are not ingesting alcohol, they get into an ice bath or a cold shower and their body temperature initially dips, but then it rebounds and increases.\\nThat's a process that's going to occur when people do not have alcohol in their system.\\nWhen you have alcohol in your system, one of the reasons that you become hypothermic is because there's a disruption in those hypothalamic brain areas, in particular the brain area called the medial preoptic area that regulates core body temperature.\\nSo it's not so much that alcohol makes you cold, it's that alcohol disrupts the central command centers of the brain that control temperature regulation and that leads you to be slightly hypothermic.\\nSo if you then go get into a very cold lake or you get into even a cold shower or an ice bath, there's the possibility of you going very, very far down the ladder into very hypothermic territory and that can be very dangerous.\\nNow, in terms of dealing with hangover when the alcohol has been largely cleared from your system, well, that's where some of this kind of old lore combines with some of the modern science and says, well, if you can spike adrenaline and certainly getting into an ice bath or getting into a cold shower or any kind of cold body of water, provided you can do that safely, that will sharply increase your adrenaline and I should say your dopamine, that's been shown and we've talked about this on the podcast before, you get these long extended increases, several hours of increases in dopamine from deliberate cold exposure.\\nIt's well documented in humans, by the way.\\nSo one could imagine using deliberate cold exposure as a way to accelerate the recovery from hangover.\\nProvided that's done safely, I think there's no reason to not explore that and if you wonder what safely is and what temperatures to use, please check out the episode on deliberate cold exposure.\\nCold showers therefore might actually be one way to at least partially relieve hangover.\\nCertainly the science from various places in the literature converge to say that, but again, be careful, please, please, please be careful not to get into cold water when you are inebriated.\\nIt's absolutely dangerous for all the obvious reasons and it's dangerous also for the non-obvious reasons, not the least of which is the dramatic decreases in core body temperature that can make you dangerously hypothermic.\\nNow, how would you go about using deliberate cold exposure to accelerate recovery from hangover? Well, there I would look to the kind of standard protocols of one to three minutes or maybe even six minutes if you can tolerate or if you're really cold adapted, if you do seven or 10 minutes in a cold shower, although that could be a lot.\\nMost people are going to experience a sharp increase in epinephrine and adrenaline and a long lasting increase in dopamine from one to three minutes of deliberate cold exposure, ideally done immersion up to the neck.\\nAgain, do this safely, please, please, please or a cold shower where you're getting under the shower as much as possible.\\nHow cold? That's going to vary person to person.\\nI suggest making it as cold as is uncomfortable such that you really want to get out, but then you know you can stay in safely without for instance, giving yourself a heart attack because if the water is really, really cold, of course you can give yourself a heart attack.\\nMost showers won't go that cold, although probably some will.\\nAgain, please use caution, spike your adrenaline, spike your dopamine with deliberate cold exposure safely.\\nOther components of hangover that could be good targets for trying to alleviate hangover, and here I hope you are getting the picture because it is accurate to say that hangover is a multifaceted phenomenon.\\nIt's not like one molecule in one receptor.\\nIt's a bunch of things happening in the brain and body, but is the dehydration associated with alcohol.\\nAlcohol is a diuretic for multiple reasons.\\nIt causes people to excrete not only water, but also sodium.\\nSodium is an electrolyte critical for the function of neurons.\\nSo making sure that you have enough sodium, potassium and magnesium, so-called electrolytes is going to be important for proper brain function, bodily organ function.\\nEven for people that have just had one or two drinks the night before, it's likely that your electrolyte balance and your fluid balance is going to be disrupted, and that's because alcohol also disrupts the so-called vasopressin pathway.\\nI talked a lot about vasopressin and the way that it interacts with and controls different aspects of water retention and water release from the body in the form of urine in the episode on salt.\\nSo again, I'm referring to hubermanlab.com as the site where you can find that episode on salt balance and ways to restore electrolyte balance.\\nHaving your electrolytes at the proper levels before you drink is ideal.\\nSome people will say for every glass of alcohol that you drink, you should drink one glass of water.\\nI would say better would be two glasses of water, given the dehydrating effects of alcohol, and even better would be water with electrolytes.\\nThat certainly would set you up for a better day the next day.\\nIf you don't manage to do that, because I suppose it's kind of geeky walking around with electrolyte packets out at the bar or whatnot, although geeky in my book is a good thing, the next day you could take some electrolytes upon waking, maybe even some before you go to sleep at the night of drinking.\\nSo hangovers made worse by disturbed sleep, made worse by disrupted gut microbiome, made worse by disrupted electrolytes, made worse by the depletion of epinephrine and dopamine.\\nThat's why replenishing the microbiome with fermented foods, low-sugar fermented foods, that is.\\nThat's why using safe deliberate cold exposure for spiking adrenaline and for increasing dopamine.\\nAnd that's why consuming electrolytes are all going to be beneficial.\\nThe folks over at examine.com, a website that I really like because it just has so much useful information, have assembled a list of things that have been proposed, purported to improve, or I should say to remove the effects of hangover.\\nAnd as they point out, and I would like to point out over there, there isn't a lot of quality science to support the idea that any one compound can eliminate hangover.\\nAnd that's probably because hangover, again, arises from multiple organs and tissues and systems in both the brain and body.\\nNonetheless, they have a terrific list over there of things, everything from Japanese pear fruit juice has been proposed to do this to some other really esoteric things, even things like yohimbine.\\nFrankly, when I look at the literature there and elsewhere, one simply cannot find the magic substance, the one herb, the one potion that can wipe away hangover.\\nGetting rid of hangover is going to be best solved by doing a collection of a small number of very powerful things, of which I've already listed off a few.\\nHowever, there are some additional things that one can do for relieving hangover.\\nAnd one of them is to be very thoughtful about what sorts of alcohol one consumes.\\nSo I find this interesting.\\nThere have actually been studies of which types of alcohol lead to the greatest hangovers.\\nThere's actually a lot of legend and lore about this as well.\\nSome people have said, for instance, that drinks that have a high sugar content lead to greater hangovers.\\nTurns out that's not the case, or at least that's not what the science points to.\\nIf you look at the expected hangover severity, what you find is that at the bottom end of the scale, there's a drink that I'm not going to tell you for the moment, but what you find is that near it is, for instance, beer.\\nThe consumption of beer, provided it is not over consumption, right? It's not far beyond the tolerance of the individual.\\nSo there's one or two beers is less likely to cause a hangover than say whiskey.\\nAnd a glass of whiskey or I should, not as much whiskey as beer, of course, but a glass of whiskey, for instance, is more likely to cause hangover than gin, as it turns out.\\nAgain, this is what's fallen out of the data.\\nAnd yet a glass of rum or red wine is more likely to cause a hangover than any of the other things I've mentioned.\\nAt the top, top, top of the list of drinks that induce hangover is brandy.\\nAnd one could then say, well, doesn't brandy have a lot of sugar? Maybe it's the sugar that's causing hangovers.\\nAnd this is something that's been, again, discussed over and over that people say, oh, it's the high sugar drinks that cause hangover.\\nIt turns out, however, that when one looks at drinks, alcoholic drinks and sugar content and hangover, at the very bottom of the list is, gosh, this makes me cringe just to think about, is ethanol diluted in orange juice.\\nI can't believe people actually drink this.\\nBut ethanol diluted in orange juice.\\nSo this is not vodka in orange juice, okay? Vodka was third on the list from the bottom of drinks that induce hangover.\\nAgain, this is within amounts that are comfortable for the person to drink, that they have enough experience with or that they have the body weight to tolerate without getting very, very drunk.\\nSo the point is that if it were sugar that's causing hangover, well, then the ethanol diluted in orange juice would probably be at the top of the list in terms of inducing hangover, but it's not, it's at the bottom of the list.\\nAnd brandy is at the top of the list.\\nSo what you find is that what scales from ethanol diluted in orange juice to beer, to vodka, to gin, here I'm ascending the hierarchy of things that cause hangover.\\nGin, white wine, whiskey, rum, red wine, and then brandy at the peak, it's sort of the world heavyweight champion of hangover inducing drinks.\\nWell, what's increasing are congeners within those drinks.\\nCongeners are things like nitrites and other substances that give alcohol its distinctive flavor and that also lead to some of the inebriating effects of alcohol.\\nNow, then you ask, okay, well, what is it that these congeners are doing and what are these nitrites doing? And guess what? While they do have effects on the brain and on other tissues, their main effects are to disrupt the gut microbiome.\\nSo what this points to again, is that having a healthy gut microbiome and perhaps ensuring that you bolster your gut microbiome the day after drinking is going to be especially important for warding off hangover or at least reducing the effects of hangover or the symptoms of hangover or both.\\nI would love to see a study on this.\\nI could imagine designing the study myself, although this isn't really the sorts of things my laboratory does, but you can imagine some people getting probiotic and prebiotic, some regularly, some just after drinking or low sugar fermented foods and see what the effects are in terms of subjective effects of hangover, but also some physiological measures.\\nI think the way to think about hangover overall is that again, it represents a multifaceted, multi-organ, multi-tissue phenomenon.\\nAnd the best way to deal with it is as a multi-cell, multi-tissue, multi-chemical phenomenon.\\nAnd before I listed off some of the things that one could do in order to adjust hangover, again, the one that comes out at the top of that list, I believe at least based on my read of the data is to support the gut microbiome and certainly not to ingest more alcohol.\\nAnd I suppose if we were to get really honest with one another and ask what's the best way to avoid a hangover, it would be to not drink in the first place.\\nSo we've covered the major effects of alcohol that lead to this state that we call drunkenness or inebriation.\\nAgain, there's a range there.\\nYou can be tipsy, people can be blackout drunk, people can be passed out drunk.\\nWe've also talked about hangover and the fact that it's a multifaceted phenomenon and recovery from hangover involves a multifaceted approach.\\nNext, I want to talk about tolerance.\\nTolerance to alcohol is a very interesting phenomenon.\\nIt has roots mainly in the brain and in brain systems.\\nThere's not time in the world, let alone within this podcast to get into all the aspects of tolerance.\\nThere are more than 10 different types of tolerance.\\nThere's functional tolerance, chronic tolerance, rapid tolerance, there's metabolic tolerance, there's psychological tolerance.\\nLet's keep it simple for sake of today's discussion.\\nAnd for those of you that are interested in learning about all the different types of tolerance and aspects of tolerance, there's an excellent review.\\nWe will provide a link to this.\\nThis was published in 2021, so it's pretty recent in the journal, Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior.\\nIncidentally, or not so incidentally, that was the first journal I ever published in.\\nSo I have a particular affection for that journal.\\nNonetheless, it is called Tolerance to Alcohol, a Critical Yet Understudied Factor in Alcohol Addiction.\\nAnd while this paper does include alcohol addiction in the title, it's not just about alcohol addiction.\\nHere's the basic summary of what tolerance is.\\nFirst of all, tolerance refers to the reduced effects of alcohol with repeated exposure.\\nAnd it is caused mainly by changes in neurotransmitter systems in the brain that are the direct consequence of the toxicity of alcohol, that aldehyde molecule that we talked about before.\\nThere's enormous number of chemicals that change with repeated exposure to acetyl aldehyde, everything from GABA to dopamine to serotonin, second messenger systems, adenosine, and on and on.\\nRather than go into each of those in detail, I just want to talk about the contour of the reinforcing and the tolerance-inducing effects of alcohol.\\nWhat do I mean by that? Well, here we are back to our old friend, meaning the molecule that comes up over and over again in these podcast episodes, which is dopamine.\\nWhether or not somebody has a predisposition alcoholism or not, whether or not they're experienced drinker or not, when people initially start drinking, there are increases in dopamine or what we call dopaminergic transmission.\\nDopamine is involved in motivation, craving, it creates a sense of wellbeing, it increases energy.\\nAgain, typically only at the beginning of alcohol exposure.\\nThat occurs in most people as a sharp spike, as a increase.\\nAgain, if somebody does not have alcohol dehydrogenase or has very low levels of the enzyme that convert that acetyl aldide into acetate and the metabolized alcohol, in other words, they will feel sick and lousy in a way that will override any recognition of the dopamine release.\\nThey're going to be the people that are listening to this and just think, alcohol just makes me feel sick.\\nI don't like it.\\nOkay, that's a specific subcategory of people, but most people experience some sort of mild euphoria.\\nThat's why so many people drink, right? The current estimates are that in most countries and certainly in the US, as many as 80% of the adult legal drinking age population drinks alcohol.\\nAnd that number could be even higher now because in the last couple of years has been a trend towards increased alcohol consumption, especially in the wake of the pandemic and during the pandemic topic for another time.\\nSo there's an increase in dopamine and an increase in serotonin.\\nSo it's kind of an increase in wellbeing, an increase in mood, but it's a very short-lived increase.\\nVery soon after and actually triggered by that increase is a long and slow reduction in dopamine and serotonin and related molecules and circuits.\\nSo basically what you're getting is a blip of feel good followed by a long, slow arc of feeling not so great, which is why typically people will drink again and again across the night.\\nThe key thing to understand about tolerance is that with tolerance, the duration of that long, slow reduction in dopamine and serotonin gets even longer.\\nIn other words, the negative effects of alcohol that happened after the initial feeling good extend longer and in fact get more robust.\\nHowever, there's also a reduction in the reinforcing properties of alcohol.\\nThere's a shrinking of the feel good blip that happens when one first ingests alcohol.\\nAnd this has been measured in animals and humans.\\nSo the first drink that somebody has provided they have enough alcohol dehydrogenase that doesn't make them feel nauseous and sick right away, they feel really good.\\nAnd then as it wears off, they feel kind of lousy and they want to drink more.\\nSo they might drink more.\\nWith each subsequent drink and even drinks on different nights or even different weeks, the amount of dopamine that's released is reduced.\\nThe amount of serotonin that's released is reduced.\\nSo what you're getting is less and less of the reinforcing properties of alcohol.\\nThe feel good stuff and more and more of the punishment pain signal aspects of alcohol.\\nThis is the contour of chemical release in the brain that was referred to by my colleague, the incredible Dr. Anna Lemke, who's a medical doctor.\\nShe wrote the incredible book, Dopamine Nation.\\nShe was a guest on this podcast, on Joe Rogan's podcast, on Rich Roll's podcast and several other podcasts, world expert in addiction.\\nAnd she talked about this pleasure pain balance that extends beyond alcohol to things like sex and gambling and to other behaviors that can potentially become addictive, but certainly includes alcohol.\\nSo tolerance, it seems, is a process in which people are ingesting more and more alcohol as an attempt to get that feeling of wellbeing back.\\nBut what they're really getting is an extended period of punishment, of pain and of malaise from the alcohol.\\nNow you might say, well, how does that relate to tolerance? Well, it turns out what they do behaviorally.\\nAnd when I say they, I mean, animals do this and humans do this, is they start drinking more and more in an attempt to activate those dopamine and serotonin neurons and receptors.\\nAnd as they do that, there is an increase in alcohol dehydrogeny.\\nSo the enzyme that metabolizes alcohol is increased because the body and liver have to contend with all that alcohol.\\nSo now you've got, again, the two-hit model.\\nYou're getting less of the feel-good chemicals, more of the negative chemical release or pattern of subjective feeling, I should say.\\nAnd you're metabolizing alcohol more quickly and more readily, but it's not taking you to a better place in terms of how you feel.\\nThat's one of the major underlying reasons for what we call tolerance.\\nSo if you're somebody who drinks and you notice that the feeling that you are seeking with alcohol is now requiring an additional drink or drinks, plural, chances are you are disrupting the dopamine and serotonergic systems of your brain.\\nAnd you are doing that in a way that is increasing the pain and punishment signals that follow alcohol ingestion.\\nAnd again, that's not just on the night that you're drinking but afterwards as well.\\nIs that all bad news? Well, pretty much, but the good news is that if you abstain from drinking for some period of time, then of course these systems reset.\\nHow long you need to abstain will depend on how much you were drinking and how long you were drinking for.\\nCertainly people who have alcohol use disorder, who are alcoholics, their main goal should be to quit alcohol completely.\\nI know there's some debate about this and I don't want to get into that debate because I'm certainly not going to try and direct anyone's recovery.\\nThere are expert counselors and MDs and people that can work with people.\\nIn fact, for some very heavy drinkers and people with serious alcohol use disorder going cold turkey that is stopping drinking completely can actually be medically dangerous.\\nSo the path to sobriety for certain people looks different than the path to sobriety for other people.\\nWhat I'm referring to here are people that are ingesting again somewhere between on average, one to two drinks per night, whether or not that's done night to night or whether or not that's condensed to weekend use.\\nI know a number of people are going to ask, perhaps are screaming, is drinking good for me in any way? For instance, many people have probably heard that resveratrol is good for people and that red wine is enriched in resveratrol.\\nI hate to break it to you, but the reality is that if indeed resveratrol is good for us and there's some debate about this, some people say strongly yes, some people say no, other people say maybe, the amount of red wine that one would have to drink in order to get enough resveratrol in order for it to be health promoting is so outrageously high that it would surely induce other negative effects that would offset the positive effects of resveratrol.\\nSo I wish I could tell you different.\\nAgain, I'm not here to be the bearer of bad news, but the statement I just made was confirmed by Dr. David Sinclair when he was a guest on this podcast.\\nIt's confirmed by other researchers who work on resveratrol and related pathways.\\nI wish I could tell you that red wine is good for your health and indeed it might be through some other mechanisms.\\nSo for instance, there have been studies of low to moderate red wine consumption.\\nThis would be anywhere from one to four glasses per week and I don't mean enormous glasses, I mean six ounce glasses of red wine.\\nAnd in those cases, some of the stress reduction that can be induced by consumption of red wine, maybe some of the other micronutrients and components within red wines, in particular red wines that come from particular grapes and this gets really nuanced and frankly is not well worked out in the peer reviewed literature, certainly not clinical trials, at least not that I'm aware of.\\nTell me if you're aware of a great clinical trial on this.\\nWell, there may be some positive effects of that very low level of consumption.\\nI'm not trying to take away anybody's red wine, I'm not trying to take away anybody's anything.\\nI would be remiss however, if I didn't tell you that resveratrol as the argument for drinking and drinking red wine in particular is just not a good one.\\nIt's just not supported by the peer reviewed research.\\nA few other things about alcohol and health.\\nAt the beginning of the episode, I referenced a study showing that indeed not just heavy alcohol consumption of 12 to 24 or more drinks per week, but also light to moderate alcohol consumption of any type, wine, beer, spirits, et cetera, does reduce the thickness of the brain.\\nIt really does reduce cortical thickness.\\nIn fact, it actually scales with the amount of alcohol that people drink and this has been well documented in a number of different studies.\\nI can provide a link to several of these.\\nOne of the more striking ones actually shows that there's almost a dose dependent increase in shrinkage of the gray matter volume and in these white matter tracks, these axons, these wires as it would that connect different neurons as a function of how much alcohol people drink.\\nAnd that's also what's been seen in this recent study that I referenced at the beginning and that's in the show note captions.\\nSo again, probably the best amount of alcohol to drink would be zero glasses per week or ounces per week.\\nFor those of you drinking low amounts of alcohol, make sure you're doing other things to promote your health.\\nAnd for those of you that are drinking moderate and certainly for those of you that are heavy drinkers, please do everything you can to move away from that and to quit entirely.\\nBut even for the moderate consumers of alcohol, you are going to want to be aware of some of the negative health effects and do things to offset those if indeed you're not going to stop drinking or reduce your intake.\\nOne of the really bad effects of alcohol, but that's extremely well documented is the fact that alcohol because of this toxicity of acetyl aldehyde and related pathways can alter DNA methylation.\\nIt can alter gene expression.\\nThat can be many things in different tissues, but it is associated with a significant increase in cancer risk, in particular, breast cancer.\\nAnd in particular, because breast tissue is present in both males and females, but in women, it's especially vulnerable to some of the DNA methylation changes.\\nWell, breast cancer in women has a relationship to alcohol intake and alcohol intake has a relationship to breast cancer in women.\\nIn fact, there has been proposed to be a anywhere from four to 13% increase in risk of breast cancer for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed.\\nHow much is 10 grams? Well, there we need to think a little bit about the variation in the amount of alcohol in different drinks across the world.\\nDifferent countries serve different size drinks and have different concentrations of alcohol in those drinks.\\nSo without going down too much of a rabbit hole and just giving you some good rules of thumb to work with, there've been studies of the percentage of alcohol included in different drinks and the sizes of different drinks that are served in different countries.\\nAnd here's a kind of a patchwork of those findings.\\nIn Japan, one beer, one glass of wine, or one shot of liquor as it's served there tends to include anywhere from seven to eight grams of alcohol.\\nIn the U.S., one beer, which generally is 12 ounces, if it's in a bottle, one glass of wine or a shot of liquor tends to include about 10 to 12 grams of alcohol.\\nAnd in Russia, one drink of the various sorts that I just described, typically will have as much as 24 grams of alcohol because of the differences in the concentration of alcohols and the sizes of drinks that are poured in these different countries, okay? Of course, there are other countries in the world.\\nThose countries are also vitally important, but those are the ones that I extracted from the studies that I could find.\\nWhat does this mean? Well, what we're talking about is that for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed, so that's one beer in the U.S., maybe a little bit more than one beer in Japan, or basically a third of a drink in Russia, there's a four to 13% increase in risk of cancer.\\nThat's pretty outrageous, right? And you might think, wait, how could it be that this stuff is even legal? Well, look, as I described before, it's a toxin.\\nIt's also a toxin that people enjoy the effects of.\\nI mean, in the U.S., at least they tried prohibition.\\nIt certainly did lead, yes, did lead, to a reduction in alcohol-induced health disorders, in particular, cirrhosis of the liver.\\nIt also led to a lot of crime because it became a substance that a lot of people still wanted and that people were willing to break the law in order to provide, or I should say to sell and provide.\\nBut the point is that the more alcohol people drink, the greater their increase of cancer, in particular, breast cancer.\\nAnd that's because of the fact that alcohol has these effects on cells that include changes in gene expression.\\nAnd cancer, that is the growth of tumors, is a dysregulation in cell cycles, right? A tumor is a aggregation or the proliferation.\\nAggregation is stuff sticking together, by the way.\\nProliferation is stuff duplicating.\\nA proliferation and aggregation of cells that could be a glioma, glial cells, glioma, brain tumor, right, it could be lymphoma, so within the lymph tissue, et cetera.\\nThe mutations that alcohol induces to cause this are wide-ranging.\\nSome of those are starting to start to be understood.\\nFor those of you that are interested in cell biology, I'll just mention that the PD-1 pathway, again, this is super specialized and for the aficionados only.\\nYou don't need to know this.\\nThe PD-1 pathway seems to be upregulated and, and we knew this from the discussion earlier, there's a down regulation in some of the anti-inflammatory molecules that help suppress this proliferation of cancers.\\nNowadays, there's a lot of interest in the fact that the immune system is constantly combating cancers that exist in us all the time.\\nYou know, little tumors start growing and our immune system goes and gobbles them up.\\nLittle tumors start growing, the immune system senses inflammation, sends out these incredible cells, these killer B cells and T cells and beats them up.\\nCancers proliferate and take hold and cause serious problems when the proliferation of cells exceeds the immune system's ability to gobble up and remove those cells.\\nThere are other mechanisms of regulating cancers, but that's one of the primary one.\\nAnd alcohol hits it, again, it's a two-hit model.\\nIt increases tumor growth and it decreases the sorts of molecules that suppress and combat tumor growth.\\nSo again, even low to moderate amounts of alcohol can be problematic for sake of cancers, in particular, breast cancers.\\nEpidemiologists and health specialists love to try and compare different substances in terms of how bad they are.\\nRarely do they compare substances in terms of how good they are, but sometimes they do.\\nAnd what they'll sometimes tell you and what you can find in the literature is that ingesting 10 to 15 grams of alcohol a day, so that would be like one beer in the US, one glass of wine, is the same as smoking 10 cigarettes a day.\\nFrankly, it's hard to make that direct relationship really stick because it's a question of how long people inhale, do they have a predisposition to a lung cancer, et cetera.\\nBut even if that number is off by plus or minus two cigarettes or even if that number would, the equivalent of one glass of wine equals one cigarette per day, I think there's general consensus now that nicotine consumed by vaping or by cigarette, it's bad for us in terms of lung cancer and other forms of cancer.\\nAnd for some reason, I don't know why, because this knowledge about alcohol and cancer and these established relationships have been known since the late 1980s.\\nThe first landmark paper on this was published in 1987.\\nI can provide a link to that paper.\\nIt's actually quite interesting to read.\\nWell, the relationship is there and yet we don't often hear about it, right? In fact, before researching this episode, I had heard before that alcohol can increase cancer risk, but I wasn't aware of just how strong that relationship is.\\nBecause of the serious nature of what we're talking about and because I would hate to be confusing or misleading to anybody, I want to just emphasize that this statistic that there is a four to 13%, depending on which study you look at, a four to 13% increase in the risk of cancer, in particular breast cancer, for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed, that's 10 grams per day.\\nSo that's one drink per day.\\nBut I do want to emphasize that if that equates to seven drinks per week and all those seven drinks are being consumed on Friday and Saturday, it still averages to 10 grams per day.\\nAnd I also want to emphasize that there are things that people can do to at least partially offset some of the negative effects of alcohol as it relates to predisposition to the formation of certain kinds of tumors and cancers.\\nI also want to be clear before I say it, that doing the things I'm about to tell you is not a guarantee that you're not going to get cancer, nor is it a guarantee that alcohol is not going to lead to an increased predisposition for certain kinds of cancers.\\nAnd the two things are consumption of folate and other B vitamins, especially B12.\\nThe consumption of folate and B12 has been shown to decrease cancer risk in people that ingest alcohol, but not completely offset it.\\nWhy that is, isn't exactly clear.\\nIt probably has something to do with the relationship between folate and B12 and other B vitamins in gene regulation pathways that can lead to tumor growth.\\nAt some point soon, we will get an expert in cancer biology and in particular in breast cancer biology on the program.\\nAnd we can ask them about this, but I realize this is going to raise a number of questions and maybe even cause some of you to go out there and start taking folate and other B vitamins and B12.\\nNot incidentally, a lot of the reported hangover supplements and treatments include folate and B12.\\nI don't know if they had the cancer literature in mind when they created those supplements and products.\\nI doubt they did.\\nAlcohol really does disrupt B vitamin pathways, both synthesis pathways and utilization pathways.\\nSo sometimes you'll hear, oh, if you get your B vitamins, it helps you recover from hangover more quickly.\\nAgain, the literature doesn't support that, but also again, there aren't a lot of studies, but more to the point as it relates to alcohol and the formation of tumors and cancers, it does appear that decreased folate and other B vitamins like B12 are partially responsible for the effect of alcohol and increasing cancer risk.\\nAnd it does appear that consuming adequate amounts of folate in B12 might, again, might partially really want to boldface and underline and highlight, partially offset some of that increased risk.\\nThere's an additional category that I want to highlight, of course, and this is vitally important to state, even though it's obvious, which is that people who are pregnant should absolutely not consume alcohol.\\nFetal alcohol syndrome is well-known and established.\\nIt's terrible.\\nFetuses experience diminished brain development that's often permanent, diminished limb development, diminished organ development in the periphery, meaning the heart, the lungs, the liver, et cetera.\\nIngesting alcohol while pregnant is simply a bad idea.\\nAnd the reason I say this at all is, first of all, it's important to include in an episode like this, but also because we can look at two things.\\nFirst of all, we can look at mechanism, and then we can also look at some of the lore that still sadly exists out there.\\nLet's take care of the lore that sadly exists first.\\nIf you look online, you will sometimes be able to find, sadly, that some people believe that certain kinds of alcohol are not detrimental to fetuses.\\nThey'll say, well, champagne is safe for a pregnant mother to drink, but beer is not.\\nThat is absolutely categorically false.\\nAlcohol is alcohol.\\nThere is no evidence whatsoever that consuming certain types of alcohol is safer for fetuses than others.\\nAlcohol is a toxin, and the reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists is because the ability of that toxin to disrupt cellular processes.\\nRemember tumor growth and the way that alcohol can accelerate tumor growth by proliferation of cells, the wrong cells, the ones you don't want to proliferate? Well, all of embryonic development, all of fetal development, it's not the growth of a tumor, it's obviously the growth of an embryo, and it's done in a very orchestrated way.\\nI started off studying brain development.\\nThat's where I got my beginnings in neurobiology, and I still teach embryology to medical students and graduate students.\\nThe set of coordinated processes that has to take place from conception to birth in order to give rise to a healthy embryo is so dynamically controlled and so exquisitely precise with checkpoints and recovery mechanisms and redundancy in the genes that are expressed to make sure that if anything goes wrong, it's repaired, et cetera.\\nAlcohol as a mutagen, I haven't used that word yet, but a substance that can mutate DNA through alterations in DNA methylation and these checkpoints in the cell cycle.\\nAlcohol as a mutagen is one of the worst things that a developing embryo can be exposed to.\\nAnd again, because it's water-soluble and fat-soluble, ingestion of alcohol when people are pregnant passes right to the fetus.\\nNow, I realize that a number of people out there might be thinking, oh, goodness, I didn't realize I was pregnant until a certain stage of pregnancy, and before I realized I was ingesting alcohol.\\nObviously, one can't undo what's been done, but I want to also emphasize that fetal alcohol syndrome, while, yes, there's a full-blown syndrome that manifests as changes in the craniofacial development that are very obvious, and you can look these up.\\nYou've probably seen these before, the pictures before, rather.\\nIt has to do with eye spacing, forehead size, a number of other features of the craniofacial development.\\nAnd of course, stuff's going on in the brain, too.\\nIt's along a continuum.\\nSo it is possible that some of the changes that occur are more minor, and thankfully, the young brain, in particular the early postnatal brain, is incredibly plastic.\\nThere are things that can be done in order to help recover neural circuits that didn't develop well, et cetera.\\nBut even though it's somewhat obvious or should be obvious, I really want to make clear that there's zero evidence whatsoever that certain forms of alcohol are safer for pregnant women to ingest than others.\\nAbsolutely wrong.\\nNo one who's pregnant should be ingesting alcohol whatsoever.\\nAnd certainly, if people feel like they can't avoid alcohol while pregnant, they really need to work with somebody to make sure that it just absolutely doesn't happen because it is so detrimental to the developing fetus.\\nLastly, I want to talk about the effects of alcohol on hormones, and I want to distinguish between low amounts of alcohol intake, higher amounts of alcohol intake, and again, this chronic alcohol intake versus occasional use versus really chronic use, meaning alcoholic or alcoholic use disorder where people are drinking an immense amount on an ongoing basis.\\nThe literature on alcohol and hormones is quite extensive, and there are, of course, many, many different types of hormones.\\nThe hormones that most often get mentioned and talked about on this podcast are the hormones testosterone and estrogen, which are present in both men and women, in both men and women, are important for things like libido, they're also responsible for sexual development, actual development of the genitalia before birth and after birth.\\nThey're responsible, for instance, estrogen is important for memory and cognition.\\nYou never want to drop estrogen too low in men or women because it can disrupt cognition and joint health, et cetera.\\nTo keep this discussion relatively constrained, it's fair to say that alcohol, and in particular, the toxic metabolites of alcohol, increase the conversion of testosterone to estrogen.\\nNow, this occurs in a number of different tissues.\\nThis is not just occurring in the testes of males.\\nThis is occurring in lots of different tissues, and I'll refer you to an excellent review.\\nWe'll provide a link in the show note captions.\\nThis is a paper that was published in the year 2000, but the data are still quite strong.\\nThe journal is called, of all things, Alcohol.\\nThere's, yes, literally a journal called Alcohol for the publication of data and reviews on alcohol and its effects.\\nAnd the title of the paper is, Can Alcohol Promote Aromatization of Androgens to Estrogens? Aromatization is this process of the conversion of testosterone and other androgens to estrogens through things like aromatase enzyme.\\nAnd this is a beautiful review that describes every tissue or near every tissue from the ovary in females to the placenta, to the liver, to the testes in which alcohol can increase the aromatization of testosterone to estrogen.\\nNow in females, this may be part of the reason why there's an increase in estrogen-related cancers.\\nBreast cancer can be either estrogen-related or non-estrogen-related.\\nThere are other types of estrogen-related cancers outside of breast cancer, but it appears that one reason why alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer is because of this aromatization from, of testosterone, excuse me, to estrogen.\\nIn males, accelerated or abnormal conversion of testosterone to estrogen can actually lead to growth of the breast tissue in males, so-called gynecomastia, or other effects of high estrogen, or I should say of altered testosterone-estrogen ratios, because that's really what's important.\\nAnd these can include things like diminished sex drive, increased fat storage, and a number of other things that I think most people would find to be negative effects.\\nI once talked about the fact that drinking alcohol can increase the aromatization of testosterone to estrogen.\\nI posted that online, and I didn't get attacked, but I did get criticized for the fact that it has been shown, yes, has been shown, that small amounts of alcohol ingestion, so five grams or so of alcohol ingestion, this would be half a glass of wine or half a glass of beer, at least in some studies showed increases in testosterone, which was kind of surprising, but I should point out, other studies have shown that alcohol ingestion causes decreases in testosterone over time.\\nSo there's always this issue of whether or not you're looking at a study of acute exposure versus chronic exposure, one dose versus multiple doses and exposure.\\nI think it's fair to say, based on my read of the literature, this review and other reviews that focus more particularly on humans, that regular ingestion of alcohol is going to increase estrogen levels, whether or not you're male or female, and it's largely doing that through the aromatization process by increasing the aromatase enzyme.\\nYes, there's some dose dependence, but I think if you're somebody who's trying to optimize your testosterone to estrogen ratio, regardless of whether or not you're male or female, well, then most certainly, you're going to want to avoid drinking too much alcohol.\\nSo we've covered a lot of topics and data related to the mechanisms of alcohol, hangover, tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera.\\nI acknowledge that I've mainly talked to you about the negative effects of alcohol.\\nI want to acknowledge that many people enjoy alcohol in moderation or even light drinking, the occasional drink or the occasional two drinks, or maybe even on average, one drink per night, so seven drinks per week.\\nI'm certainly not here to tell you what to do and what not to do.\\nI do find it immensely interesting, however, that first of all, alcohol is a known toxin to the cells of the body.\\nSome of you might immediately say, well, wait, what about hormesis? What about this phenomenon where if we regularly ingest a toxin, it makes us stronger.\\nIn other words, what doesn't kill us makes us stronger.\\nThere's some reason to believe that might be beneficial in terms of some forms of cellular resilience, maybe, maybe, no, sorry.\\nIt doesn't work that way.\\nThere are processes of hormesis in which, for instance, exposing yourself safely to increases in adrenaline through ice baths or other things that increase adrenaline can raise your so-called stress threshold.\\nBut here we're talking about cellular stress and damage to cells.\\nSo my read of the literature, and again, this is my read and I invite others to provide studies or I would prefer actually collections of studies that point in the direction, if they exist, that alcohol can be beneficial.\\nBut my read of the literature, where I should say, my understanding of what I would call the center of mass of the literature on alcohol is that no consumption, zero consumption, consumption of zero ounces of alcohol is going to be better for your health than low to moderate consumption of alcohol.\\nAnd that low to moderate consumption of alcohol is going to be better for you, of course, than moderately high to high alcohol consumption on the order of 12 to 24 or more drinks per week.\\nI realize that for most people listening to this, it's probably low to moderate alcohol consumption that is part of their standard repertoire.\\nAnd I'm not here to give you justification for doing that, nor am I going to tell you not to do that.\\nI would like you to consider perhaps, however, the negative effects that we understand and that are documented, for instance, the negative effects of alcohol and the gut microbiome and the things that you can do to better support your gut microbiome.\\nThe negative effects on the stress system, that HPA axis that we talked about earlier and the fact that even low to moderate levels of alcohol consumption can increase our levels of stress when we're not drinking.\\nAnd to think about acquiring some tools and getting some proficiency with tools, behavioral or otherwise, that can help you with stress modulation that don't involve alcohol consumption.\\nAgain, the point here is to illustrate where the problems lie with alcohol consumption, but also what I've tried to do is to point you to some resources that can help offset some of those negative effects.\\nWill they offset all the effects? I can't say that for sure, but certainly taking measures to offset some of the negative effects of any alcohol consumption that you might be having or doing is going to be beneficial to you.\\nAnd those tools and protocols are going to be health promoting in any case.\\nIf you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast, please subscribe to our YouTube channel.\\nThat's a terrific zero-cost way to support us.\\nIn addition, please subscribe to the podcast on Spotify and on Apple.\\nAnd on both Spotify and Apple, you can leave us up to a five-star review.\\nIf you have questions for us about the content covered on the podcast or suggestions of topics you'd like us to cover or guests that you'd like us to host on the Huberman Lab Podcast, please include all of that in the comment section on YouTube.\\nWe do read all the comments.\\nPlease also check out the sponsors mentioned at the beginning of today's podcast and check out Momentous Supplements, our new partners in the supplement space and check out Athletic Greens.\\nThat's the best way to support this podcast.\\nIf you're not already following us on social media, please do so.\\nWe are Huberman Lab on Twitter and we are also Huberman Lab on Instagram.\\nIn both places, I cover science and science-related tools, some of which overlap with the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast, but much of which is unique from the content covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast.\\nAgain, that's Huberman Lab on Instagram and Huberman Lab on Twitter.\\nPlease also check out our Neural Network monthly newsletter.\\nThis is a newsletter that has summaries of podcast episodes.\\nIt also includes a lot of actionable protocols.\\nIt's very easy to sign up for the newsletter.\\nYou go to hubermanlab.com, click on the menu, go to newsletter, you supply your email, but we do not share your email with anybody.\\nWe have a very clear and rigorous privacy policy, which is we do not share your email with anybody.\\nAnd the newsletter comes out once a month and it is completely zero cost.\\nAgain, just go to hubermanlab.com and go to the Neural Network newsletter.\\nI'd also like to point out that the Huberman Lab Podcast has a clips channel.\\nSo these are brief clips, anywhere from three to 10 minutes that encompass single concepts and actionable protocols related to sleep, to focus, interviews with various guests.\\nWe talk about things like caffeine, when to drink caffeine relative to sleep, alcohol, when and how and if anyone should ingest it relative to sleep, dopamine, serotonin, mental health, physical health, and on and on, all the things that relate to the topics most of interest to you.\\nYou can find that easily by going to YouTube, look for Huberman Lab clips in the search area and it will take you there, subscribe.\\nAnd we are constantly updating those with new clips.\\nThis is especially useful, I believe, for people that have missed some of the earlier episodes or you're still working through the back catalog of Huberman Lab Podcasts, which admittedly can be rather long.\\nAnd last, but certainly not least, thank you for your interest in science.\\nAnd we'll see you next time on Huberman Lab Podcasts.\\n\", metadata={'source': 'docs/youtube/What Alcohol Does to Your Body, Brain & Health ｜ Huberman Lab Podcast #86.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.\\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.\\nToday, we are discussing caffeine.\\nCaffeine is one of the most widely used substances on the planet.\\nEstimates are that more than 90% of adults and as many as 50% of kids, that is adolescents and teenagers, use caffeine on a daily basis.\\nCaffeine is an amazing molecule.\\nMost people are familiar with caffeine's ability to increase alertness and to reduce our feelings of sleepiness and fatigue.\\nAnd indeed, it does that.\\nBut what most people are not aware of is that caffeine acts as a strong reinforcer.\\nWhat I mean by reinforcer is that when caffeine is present in a drink or food, and yes, indeed, caffeine is present in many foods, even unbeknownst to us, when it's present in drinks and foods, we actively come to like those foods and drinks more than if caffeine were not contained in those foods and drinks.\\nSo it reinforces our liking of particular foods and drinks, and indeed, it even reinforces our liking of the containers they are consumed from and the company we keep when we consume foods and drinks that contain caffeine.\\nThat is, caffeine is not just a stimulant, caffeine is a reinforcer, and it's a reinforcer that plays an active role in almost everybody's daily life.\\nWe can say that with confidence because, as I mentioned a moment ago, more than 90% of people are consuming caffeine, and most people think that they consume caffeine because it makes them feel more alert.\\nBut there are many reasons why you're consuming caffeine, and I'm not going to tell you that consuming caffeine isn't necessarily bad.\\nIn fact, today, I'm going to tell you about many of the positive health benefits of caffeine, including neuroprotective effects, anti-depressive effects, and certainly performance-enhancing effects, both for mental performance and for physical performance.\\nNow, that said, there are certain situations in which you want to avoid caffeine, and there are certain people who might opt to avoid caffeine.\\nThat's especially the case when one thinks about caffeine not just as a stimulant, but as a reinforcer.\\nIn fact, caffeine is such a strong reinforcer that if even tiny amounts of caffeine are present in certain foods and drinks, you will very quickly come to prefer those foods and drinks over other choices, which can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on what sorts of food and drink choices you're trying to make.\\nSo today, I'm going to inform you about how caffeine works at a mechanistic level.\\nI promise to do that with a minimum of nomenclature and such that even if you don't have a background in biology, you will be able to digest that information easily.\\nAnd then I'll tell you how to use caffeine to your advantage, or conversely, how to avoid caffeine at certain times to your advantage.\\nSo today's episode will focus both on mechanisms and tools that is the use and leverage of caffeine to improve mental health, physical health, and performance.\\nBefore we go any further into today's discussion, I want to tell you about some recent results about a molecule that's found in certain caffeinated beverages and that has been proven to be very useful for both weight loss, mental performance, and controlling blood sugar levels.\\nAnd that's GLP-1 or glucagon-like peptide-1.\\nGlucagon-like peptide-1 is found in the brain and body.\\nIt acts both on the brain and body.\\nIt does many different things, but one of its primary effects that's been discovered is to reduce hunger, and it does that two ways.\\nIt does that by activating certain neurons in your hypothalamus, so that's a brain region that controls hunger and satiety.\\nIt makes us feel full at the level of the brain, so it makes us feel sated, that is, and it actually makes us feel full.\\nTurns out that GLP-1 acts on certain receptors in the gut to make us feel as if we've ingested enough food.\\nIt doesn't necessarily make us feel as if our gut is distended, but it makes us feel full.\\nThat's really interesting, because if you think about it, when we eat, our stomach fills up, obviously, and that information has to be communicated to the brain such that the brain can then send satiety signals that actually shut off our hunger.\\nAnd believe it or not, the brain actually activates signals to reduce the desire to chew when our stomach is full.\\nAnd GLP-1, as I mentioned, works on the brain to create these feelings of satiety, as if we've had enough, and to reduce our desire to eat more.\\nAnd GLP-1 acts directly on the gut to give us a slight sense of fullness in the gut, which then is communicated to the brain.\\nSo really, there are two parallel signals being sent when we have GLP-1 present in our system.\\nNow, a little bit of relevant history on GLP-1, it was actually discovered in Gila monsters.\\nThese are these reptiles that can go long periods of time without eating, and a very clever scientist decided to study why it is that certain animals, like Gila monsters, can go a long period of time without ingesting anything, and it's because they produce very large amounts of GLP-1.\\nThey isolate the peptide from GLP-1, then they looked for the analogous peptide in humans, and it turns out that does exist.\\nAnd as I mentioned, it's released in both brain and body to make you feel full and sated.\\nWhy am I telling you all this? Well, today we're going to talk about caffeine, and there's one particular caffeine source, which is yerba mate, and there's some other forms of teas, similar to yerba mate, that stimulate the release of GLP-1 significantly.\\nThere are also nowadays drugs, which are called analogs of GLP-1, so these are drugs that mimic or are identical to the kind of GLP-1 that you would make, and those drugs are proving to be very effective for the treatment of certain forms of diabetes and for the treatment of obesity, but they trigger enormous amounts of GLP-1 pathway activation.\\nSo those are extreme cases for people that are really struggling for weight loss, but the clinical trials and the data that are out there in the general population now are very, very promising for GLP-1 analogs.\\nYerba mate tea, provided it's not the smoked variety, and I mention that because a number of people have cued me to the fact that yerba mate teas come in smoked varieties and non-smoked varieties, and the smoked varieties are thought to perhaps be carcinogenic, that is, pro-cancer causing.\\nSo I advise people to avoid smoked varieties of yerba mate tea, but yerba mate teas are known to stimulate significant amounts of GLP-1 release, and so they can be effective as a weight loss tool, mainly by blunting appetite, and again, they do that both at the level of the brain and at the level of the gut.\\nNow, all of what I just told you has been known for some period of time, but there are a new set of findings that were just published in Cell Reports Medicine, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal, which indicate exactly how it is that GLP-1 stimulates both satiety and can trigger additional weight loss through other mechanisms.\\nAnd I find the mechanism to be really interesting and actually really important, given some other topics we've covered on this podcast before.\\nSo the basic finding is that GLP-1, whether or not it's stimulated through the release of analog drug that one is prescribed, or by drinking yerba mate tea, for instance, and stimulate release of your own so-called endogenous GLP-1, yes, it makes you feel more full at the level of brain and body, but it turns out it also stimulates thermogenesis.\\nNow, thermogenesis is the active utilization of more metabolic energy, and fat cells, in particular, so-called beige and brown fat cells, are a potent source of thermogenic activity in your body.\\nThe basic background is that you have white adipose cells, so white fat cells, you have beige fat cells, and you have brown fat cells, and the beige and brown ones are fat cells that you actually want more of.\\nThey are not abundant under your skin, they're abundant really around your clavicles and your upper neck, they are the ones that generate heat, and the beige and brownness of them is actually the consequence of having a lot of mitochondria in those cells.\\nWhen GLP-1 is elevated in your system, it turns out that it communicates to those white fat cells and helps convert them into beige and brown fat cells, that is, it takes fat cells that are not doing anything useful for you except being stored energy, and I think most people out there would like to have fewer of those white adipose cells, there are few of you out there that actually need more of them that are too thin, too lean, but most people are suffering from having too many of these white adipose cells.\\nWell, when you ingest yerba mate tea or you were to take a GLP-1 analog or stimulate GLP-1 in any number of different ways, yes, you stimulate increased satiety, but you're also stimulating the conversion of these white fat cells into beige and brown fat cells, which makes you more thermogenic, and over time, raises your basal metabolic rate, so you're burning more calories even at rest.\\nIt also makes you feel as if you're more comfortable in colder environments at rest.\\nThis is very much the same as the mechanism that's induced when you were to, say, take a cold shower or do regular ice baths or get into cold water regularly, that too stimulates the conversion of white fat cells to beige and brown fat cells.\\nSo I like these findings very much because they provide a mechanistic coherence, they provide, that is, a really nice story as to how something like GLP-1 could be so effective for weight loss.\\nYes, on the one hand, GLP-1 is reducing appetite, and that, of course, will help people maintain or lose weight, but it's also increasing basal metabolic rate, and we now know how that's accomplished.\\nIt's likely accomplished, at least through this one mechanism, by the stimulation of conversion of these white fat cells, which don't do much for us except as energy storage units, to these metabolically mitochondrial-rich beige and brown fat cells, which you can think of as sort of the oil in the candle that allows your furnace, your metabolism, to burn at a higher temperature and a higher rate.\\nSo that's the mechanism, and the basic tool takeaway is that if you are somebody who's interested in losing weight and you want to leverage the GLP-1 pathway, drinking a cup or two of yerba mate tea early in the day would be a great way to stimulate GLP-1 release.\\nThere are other ways to stimulate GLP-1 release.\\nYou can get it through certain forms of exercise, in particular, fasted exercise.\\nThis is actually a vote in favor of fasted exercise.\\nThere's a debate as to whether or not fasted cardio burns more fat than non-fasted cardio, and the data basically say, no, it doesn't really matter, but that doesn't really take into account the longer arc of things like GLP-1 release, so that needs to be taken into consideration.\\nSo you could do fasted cardio.\\nYou could drink yerba mate tea, keeping in mind that yerba mate tea does contain caffeine.\\nWe'll talk more about the specific forms of stimulants, including caffeine, that mate has, but mate would be a great way to stimulate GLP-1 release.\\nAnd then, of course, for those of you that are interested in more robust activation of GLP-1, then perhaps you might want to consider some of the new prescription GLP-1 analogs that are out there, but that's a more severe stimulus for GLP-1, of course.\\nAnd for everybody, regardless of whether or not you're trying to lose weight, gain weight, or maintain weight, I think we're going to be hearing a lot more about GLP-1 analogs and drinks and supplements and things of that sort that stimulate GLP-1 in the very near future, because it does appear to be a very important biological mechanism.\\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.\\nIt is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public.\\nIn keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.\\nOur first sponsor is Levels.\\nLevels is a program that lets you see how different foods affect your health by giving you real-time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor.\\nNow, blood glucose, or blood sugar, is a critical aspect of your immediate and long-term health and, indeed, your feelings of vigor and mental clarity and wellbeing at any moment.\\nOne of the key things is to know how different foods and food combinations and timing of food intake is impacting blood glucose.\\nAnd with Levels, you're able to assess all of that in real time.\\nI tried Levels, and what it taught me, for instance, was that I can eat certain foods at certain times of day, but if I eat them at other times of day, I get a blood sugar crash.\\nIt also taught me, for instance, how to space my exercise and my food intake.\\nTurns out, for me, exercising fasted is far more beneficial.\\nThat's something I learned using Levels, and it's completely transformed not just the spacing and timing of my diet and exercise, but also use of things like the sauna and other activities.\\nIt's been a tremendous learning for me that's really shaped an enormous number of factors in my life that have led to me feeling far more vigorous with far more mental focus and physical strength and endurance.\\nSo if you're interested in learning more about Levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself, go to levels.link slash Huberman.\\nAgain, that's levels.link, L-I-N-K slash Huberman.\\nToday's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep.\\n8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.\\nI've talked many times on this podcast about the critical relationship between sleep and body temperature.\\nThat is, in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep throughout the night, our body temperature needs to drop by about one to three degrees.\\nAnd conversely, when we wake up in the morning, that is in large part because of our body heating up by one to three degrees.\\nNow, people have different core body temperatures, and they tend to run colder or hotter throughout the night.\\n8 Sleep allows you to adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment so that you have the optimal temperature that gets you the best night's sleep.\\nI started sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover about eight months ago, and it has completely transformed my sleep.\\nI sleep so much deeper.\\nI wake up far less during the middle of the night, if at all, and I wake up feeling far better than I ever have, even after the same amount of sleep.\\nIf you

Huberman.\\nLet's talk about caffeine.\\nSo as I mentioned earlier, caffeine is consumed by basically most all adults every single day and consumed at very regular times each day.\\nIn fact, if you were to take a look at your caffeine intake or the caffeine intake of somebody close to you, what you would realize is that they don't do so well if their caffeine intake arrives even 10, 20 or 30 minutes past their expected or usual intake of caffeine.\\nThat's pretty remarkable.\\nAnd it brings to mind ideas that we are all quote unquote addicted to caffeine or that caffeine is somehow bad.\\nI'm certainly not going to make the argument that caffeine is bad.\\nFirst of all, I'm a regular caffeine user.\\nI wouldn't call myself a caffeine abuser, but I am a regular caffeine user.\\nAnd caffeine is known to have certain health benefits.\\nI listed off a few of them earlier, but I'll mention those again now before going forward.\\nCaffeine is known to have certain neuroprotective effects.\\nAnd that is because of its ability to increase neuromodulators such as dopamine, but also other so-called catecholamines like norepinephrine.\\nIf you don't know what those names mean, these are molecules that increase levels of alertness, motivation and drive.\\nAnd so then therefore not surprisingly, the large scale analysis of the relationship between depression and caffeine shows that provided people are not drinking so much caffeine that it makes them overly anxious, that regular intake of caffeine is inversely related to levels of depression.\\nSo it may have some antidepressant effects and those could be direct or indirect.\\nWhat do I mean by that? Well, you could imagine that if people are ingesting caffeine and they are more motivated to do work and pursue quality social interactions, then the probability that they will have depression could be lower.\\nIt could also be that there are direct effects on the chemical systems of the brain that relate to mood and wellbeing that could offset depression.\\nIt is not clear whether or not the effects of caffeine encountering depression are direct or indirect.\\nNonetheless, there's a relationship there and it's an interesting and positive one.\\nOr I should say negative correlation, positive effect overall on mood and wellbeing to be exact.\\nNow it's also the case that caffeine can improve mental performance and physical performance.\\nThis has been demonstrated in tens of thousands of studies.\\nI will review a few studies on this in particular today, but to just give you a sense of how caffeine works at the level of its timing and impact on mental performance and physical performance.\\nWhen we ingest caffeine, provided that we don't have a lot of food in our stomach and that our blood sugar isn't particularly high, generally we experience an increase in alertness within about five minutes.\\nAnd that increase in focus and alertness peaks around 30 minutes after ingestion of caffeine and persists for as long as 60 minutes.\\nNow this is assuming that one takes caffeine in pill form or drinks the entire caffeine drink within a short period of time.\\nBut a little bit later, I'll talk about how you can consume caffeine at regular intervals while doing mental work or physical work in a way that can further increase mental performance and physical performance.\\nBut let's just touch on what caffeine intake really does for mental performance and physical performance.\\nPerhaps the most robust finding across all of the studies that I've examined is that caffeine reduces our reaction time, that is it improves our reaction time.\\nIt doesn't make it longer, it makes it shorter.\\nSo for instance, in a laboratory study where people were asked to hit a lever every time they hear a tone, you can greatly reduce the time between the tone and the pressing of the lever if people ingest caffeine about 30 minutes before they do that task.\\nNow that seems like a trivial task, but this is also seen in the domain of sports performance and even in cognitive performance where people have to arrive at a particular answer to a question and the answer to that question has to be pulled from their memory banks within their brain, their hippocampus, for instance, a brain structure involved in memory.\\nAnd if you are asking people, for instance, to remember the capitals of different states or cities or to remember certain historical facts, they will do that at a particular rate.\\nBut if they've ingested caffeine within the hour prior, their ability to recall that information is much, much better.\\nThey are faster and it does not appear that accuracy is reduced.\\nIn fact, in many cases, accuracy is enhanced.\\nAnd that's because caffeine both works on the reaction time systems of the brain and body.\\nI'll talk about the mechanisms for that in a little bit, but it also stimulates certain neurotransmitters and so-called neuromodulators within the brain and body that give the neural circuits in the brain that are associated with learning and memory a lower threshold to activation.\\nWhat does that mean? That means that we are better able to access the brain circuitry involved in learning and memory when we have a certain amount of caffeine circulating in our system.\\nSo this makes caffeine an incredible performance enhancing compound.\\nAnd I could give you tens of thousands of examples of this in humans.\\nBut before I do that, I want to just touch on what we know about the existence of caffeine in nature and what the existence of caffeine in nature and its effects on other animals tells us about what caffeine does in humans.\\nBecause as I alluded to earlier, what caffeine is doing for us is not just making us more alert, improving our memory, improving our reaction time and so on.\\nIt's actually acting as a powerful reinforcer of experience.\\nAnd it's acting as not just a powerful reinforcer of the caffeine containing drink that we drink, but also the mug that it's contained in, plus the person that we might be sitting across from when we consume that caffeine and so on.\\nIf it's a little bit hard for you to conceptualize what a reinforcer is and why I'm calling it a reinforcer, let me spell it out in three specific ways.\\nWe often hear about the word reward.\\nAnd we think, okay, if we do certain things and we like the outcome, then those certain things are rewarded, right? If we're doing something, we receive praise, the praise is the reward.\\nAnd therefore we are more likely to do that thing in the future.\\nIn fact, a lot of parenting is like that.\\nAnd a lot of life is like that.\\nHowever, when we hear the word reward, we often think about something that feels good to us.\\nAnd certainly if we've worked hard and we get some praise, that's natural for the praise to feel good to us.\\nOr for instance, if we work very hard and we get a certain outcome, a trophy, a financial outcome, a degree outcome, recognition, et cetera, all of those can act as rewards, but those are all conscious rewards.\\nWe are aware that they are happening.\\nReinforcers are a little bit different because the word reinforcement can apply to conscious rewards of the sort that I just described.\\nBut there are also many ways in which caffeine stimulates the release of chemicals in our body that act as reinforcers.\\nBut those reinforcers are subconscious.\\nThat is, we are not aware that they cause this preference for the activities that cause their release.\\nSo the study I'm about to describe beautifully, I believe, encapsulates how is it that humans came to consume caffeine and why caffeine exists in nature and the powerful effects of caffeine as a reinforcing agent, both in animals, insects, and in you and me.\\nAnd the title of the paper is Caffeine and Floral Nectar Enhances a Pollinator's Memory of Reward.\\nKeep in mind that caffeine is made from plants.\\nSome of you will say, duh, but I think some of us don't realize that the reason why there is caffeine in coffee is because coffee comes from a plant.\\nIt's a coffee bean.\\nCertain teas, which of course are plants that people brew, caffeine is contained in those teas, such as yerba mate.\\nWell, why would this bitter substance, because in fact, caffeine is quite bitter in high concentrations, why would this bitter substance be something that insects or animals would want to consume at all? It turns out that in most plants, caffeine is present in small enough quantities that insects and other animals, and in fact, we can't actually taste the caffeine.\\nIf I were to give you a little bit of pure caffeine, yes, it would be a stimulant for you, but you would say that it tasted awful.\\nIt's in a category of compounds that would strongly stimulate the bitter receptors on your tongue and would make you cringe and pucker and essentially walk away from whatever it is that contained that caffeine and from the experience that contained that caffeine.\\nWell, in nature, caffeine is present in very low concentrations or is masked by other flavors within flowers, beans, and plants.\\nAnd what this paper really points to is that caffeine in nature is acting as a reinforcer for bees that are consuming different nectar.\\nSo the way that it works is that bees, of course, go from flower to flower and they are consuming the nectar.\\nThey are bringing nectar and pollen back to the hive, and that provides critical nourishment for the bee colony.\\nThe bees are foraging in a way that includes information about color, in particular, ultraviolet color, things that we can't see, but they can see because they have different photoreceptors than we do.\\nAnd what this study shows is that plants and nectars that contain very small amounts of caffeine are the preferred sources of food for bees.\\nAnd the study is beautiful because they were able to confirm that they could mask the caffeine taste so that they know that the bees are not preferring the taste of caffeine.\\nBut what they do is they pair caffeine with different food sources for the bees, then they remove the caffeine.\\nAnd what they find is that the bees very strongly prefer flavors that contain caffeine, not because they could taste the caffeine, but rather for the way that those caffeine-containing flavors made the bees feel.\\nSo how do those caffeine-containing flavors make the bees feel? The same way that they make you and I feel, a little bit more alert and thereby able to do more work.\\nFor the bee, the more work is the consumption of more food, which then has a further reinforcing effect.\\nSo what we're really talking about here is the fact that, A, caffeine exists in nature, in plants.\\nIt exists in concentrations that are very low, so low, in fact, that they are not detectable to the taste receptors of insects, and in many cases to the taste receptors of humans.\\nAnd of course, there can be high levels of caffeine in a plant, but if the plant also contains compounds that mask the flavor of caffeine, well, then those plants are going to essentially be even stronger reinforcers for the flavor of the plant.\\nOkay, so now we're talking about strong flavors plus strong neurostimulant effects of caffeine.\\nAnd the most important point here is that all of these effects of caffeine are subconscious.\\nIt is not because the bee or you likes the taste of caffeine.\\nIn fact, most people, when they take their first sip of coffee, they find that it tastes bitter and kind of noxious, they don't like it.\\nYou may not even remember that because it happened so long ago, and because caffeine is such a strong reinforcer that very quickly you come to like the taste of coffee.\\nYou might even come to like the feeling of your mug in your hand.\\nYou might even come to like the smell of coffee and so on and so forth.\\nAnd that's because caffeine stimulates the release of certain neurochemicals in the brain, in particular, dopamine and acetylcholine, two neuromodulators that increase our focus and alertness and our feelings of wellbeing.\\nA little bit later, I'll tell you that caffeine stimulates the release of dopamine in a way that's very much distinct from the classical dopamine pathway associated with addiction and reward.\\nIn fact, we can think of caffeine as having a somewhat privileged access to the reward systems.\\nI'll give you a bit of a hint of where this is going.\\nCaffeine stimulates the release of dopamine and acetylcholine not within the classic so-called mesolimbic reward pathway.\\nThat's just fancy nerd speak for the reward pathways of the brain that are associated with things like sex and food and drugs of abuse like cocaine and methamphetamine, but rather caffeine seems to stimulate the release of dopamine in the parts of the brain that are associated with alertness and cognition, meaning the forebrain.\\nThis is very important.\\nWe have multiple dopamine systems in the brain and body, and caffeine seems to stimulate dopamine directly within the components of the brain that are associated with clarity of thought and wellbeing, but more so clarity of thought.\\nNow, I'm also talking about caffeine as a strong reinforcer in that it makes you feel good overall, and it does, and that suggests that it also taps into the more classic reward pathway, but it does that in a very interesting and frankly almost diabolical way.\\nWhen we regularly ingest caffeine, it stimulates the increase in dopamine receptors at multiple sites throughout the brain, but in particular within the reward pathways of the brain.\\nSo not the areas of the brain that are associated with focus and clarity of thought and cognition.\\nIt does that, but it is also increasing the level of dopamine receptors in the reward pathway.\\nAnd what that means is that for any dopamine that's released in response to a positive experience, social experience, or any number of the other things that can stimulate dopamine release, there are more receptors, more parking spots, if you will, for that dopamine to arrive at and to exert its increases in mood, increases in motivation, and overall feelings of drive and excitement.\\nSo there are four ways that caffeine works that we need to understand.\\nFirst of all, caffeine acts as a reinforcing agent.\\nIt increases the probability that you will return to and engage in a certain activity or consume a certain beverage or food.\\nSecond of all, caffeine increases dopamine and acetylcholine, which are both neuromodulators in the forebrain, which helps us improve our ability to think, to modify our rule sets, that is to adjust our strategies for different social situations and mental demands and physical demands.\\nAnd third, it increases the number and efficacy of dopamine receptors in the reward pathways of the brain.\\nThat is, it makes things that would feel pretty good, feel even better.\\nAnd fourth, caffeine acts as an antagonist to adenosine, which offsets the sleepiness that we would otherwise feel from the accumulation of adenosine that occurs as we are awake for more and more hours throughout the day.\\nSo let's talk first about caffeine as a reinforcing agent.\\nAgain, this was first most beautifully demonstrated in this study on honeybees, where the bees prefer nectars that contain caffeine, and that all makes perfect sense in terms of the ecology of bees and flowers that contain nectar.\\nThere's an advantage, at least in terms of adaptation, that the flower benefits because of distribution of things from the flower, which is good for the flowers, and the bees benefit because they're getting food.\\nAnd so there's a kind of a symbiosis there.\\nBut with humans, we're consuming caffeine-containing beverages for our sake.\\nI don't think we have it in mind, nor do the bees have it in mind, frankly, that we're trying to preserve the plants that provide the caffeine.\\nI think we would all suffer, or I should say 90% of adults would suffer greatly if all the caffeine-containing coffee and tea plants were gone, certainly.\\nBut most of us are not consuming coffees and teas and caffeine-containing foods because we're thinking about the plants they come from and we want to help those plants.\\nWe're thinking about how we want to help ourselves.\\nAnd yet the point of the reinforcing effects of caffeine are that they are largely subconscious.\\nWe are not aware of them.\\nNow you might say, no, that's not true.\\nWhen I drink caffeine, it makes me feel really good.\\nSo I'm aware that it makes me feel good.\\nIn order to illustrate how reinforcement really works, let me give you the counter example, which would be an aversive agent.\\nSo we have reinforcing agents and we have aversive agents.\\nLet's say that there were compounds in nature that exist in plants that are aversive.\\nAnd indeed they are.\\nAnd let's say that these compounds were present at such low concentrations that you couldn't taste them.\\nLet's say you wake up in the morning and you go to your refrigerator and you open it up and you are thirsty.\\nAnd so you reach for a nice, you know, rich red-containing beverage in a glass jar.\\nMaybe it looks like cranberry juice or something of that sort, or even a nice clear glass of water.\\nIt looks like a jug of water, a glass of water, and you drink that.\\nTastes fine to you, maybe even tastes great to you.\\nAnd then let's say about 30 minutes later, you feel a little queasy, you feel a little off.\\nYou feel like going back to sleep.\\nYou just don't feel very good.\\nYou don't know why, but your nervous system is a predictive machine and it has a process in which it back integrates, or I should say integrates backwards into your immediate experience that preceded that not so good feeling.\\nWe can reliably say that there is a much lower probability that the next day when you wake up, that you would reach for that same beverage or for that same container even.\\nAnd maybe if you're in a novel environment, maybe you're staying in an Airbnb or a hotel or something of that sort, you might even find that you don't really like the kitchen in which you consume that beverage in the first place.\\nAnd then you don't know why.\\nAnd unless you got very, very sick the day before, it's unlikely that you would have such a strong response that you would entirely avoid, for instance, water or glass jars containing liquids, et cetera.\\nLet's say you went back to the refrigerator and you consume beverage again and you just didn't feel so well.\\nYou felt less good than you normally would.\\nWell, even without any ability to taste what's in that beverage, and even without any understanding of what was happening to you at a conscious level, there is a very, very high probability that you will avoid drinking that particular beverage, and certainly at that location and in the same volume in the subsequent days.\\nThat's just the way that aversive agents work.\\nAnd they work by way of activating neurons in the gut that communicate with areas in the brain that give us this feeling of queasiness.\\nAnd for some of you hearing this, that pathway and that association with times in which you felt queasy and as if you wanted to vomit is so powerful that you might even be feeling some of that symptomology now.\\nFor certain people, that's going to be increased salivation which precedes vomiting.\\nWe know that there's a class of neurons in the brain related to an area called area post tremor that actually stimulates vomiting.\\nAnd if I keep talking about this, I'll probably feel like I want to vomit.\\nSo I'm going to move on from this in a moment.\\nSo when we ingest caffeine containing beverages and foods, it's the exact opposite scenarios to what I just described.\\nCaffeine as a reinforcer makes us feel slightly better or a lot better in the immediate minutes and hours after we ingest it.\\nSo it's acting as a reinforcing agent, not just while you're under the effects of caffeine, but for the things that preceded the ingestion of caffeine which is why you return again and again to caffeine containing beverages such as coffee and tea or maybe even foods that contain caffeine, even if the taste of those foods is not something that you would otherwise consider especially delicious.\\nIn fact, most people when they take their first sip of coffee or tea or other caffeine containing beverage, they find it to be very bitter and that's not because of the taste of caffeine, it's because of the taste of the beverage itself independent of caffeine.\\nHowever, when caffeine is present in there, they come to prefer that taste over most all tastes.\\nIn fact, they will, as I mentioned earlier, will invest a lot of financial resources and time and energy to make sure that they get that beverage.\\nWhat they're trying to make sure is not that they get that taste, but that they get the caffeine.\\nIt is that positively reinforcing and the taste therefore takes on new significance, new meaning and we come to associate it as positive and in fact, most of us, including myself, love the taste of espresso, love the taste of coffee, love the taste of yerba mate, even if the initial taste, the very first time that we consume that beverage was either neutral or negative and that is all because of the reinforcing properties of caffeine.\\nAnd then of course, there are the more direct actions of caffeine, that is the faster actions of caffeine and just to list those off again very briefly so that you have them in mind going forward, caffeine also increases the release of dopamine and acetylcholine, both of which are neuromodulators in the forebrain, which increases clarity of thought and your ability to rule switch, your ability to move from one context to another and change and understand the rules of engagement, social engagement, physical engagement, mental engagement and so forth.\\nAnd as I mentioned before, caffeine also increases the number of dopamine receptors in the reward pathway, such that any good thing that happens to you, any positive experience that you have will have a more potent effect on your feelings of wellbeing.\\nAnd last but certainly not least, caffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist.\\nIt reduces your feelings of lethargy and fatigue and your desire to sleep by parking in the receptors for adenosine and not allowing adenosine to have its pro-sleepy, if you will, effects on your brain and body.\\nI'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.\\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your

free travel packs and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.\\nI'd like to just briefly talk about adenosine and some of its molecular features.\\nAnd again, if you don't have a background in biology, don't worry, I promise to make this very clear to everyone.\\nFirst of all, caffeine is what's called a methylxanthine.\\nIt's a plant alkaloid.\\nThat's why caffeine itself is very bitter.\\nAgain, if I were to give you just the tiniest little bit of pure caffeine, you would find it to be extremely aversive.\\nAnd so these plants that have snuck small enough amounts of caffeine into them or that have masked the flavor of caffeine with other flavors such that bees and humans want to consume them, while we don't know what plants think, it does seem very diabolical and very clever in that we are seeking out these caffeine-containing plants, beverages, and foods, even though caffeine itself is this alkaloid is very, very bitter.\\nMethylxanthine, that is caffeine, binds to adenosine receptors.\\nAnd there are really two types of adenosine receptors.\\nThere are these so-called A1 receptors and the A2 receptors.\\nAnd they're present in different parts of the brain and body at different levels.\\nWe don't have to get too far into receptor subtypes.\\nMore importantly to understand is that adenosine makes us feel tired because of the way that it taps into the ATP pathway.\\nThe ATP pathway is central to energy production and feelings of overall energy in our brain and body in all cells and organ systems.\\nWhen caffeine binds to adenosine receptors, it prevents adenosine from breaking down certain components of the energy production pathway.\\nAnd the net consequence of that is increased cyclic AMP.\\nSo basically, when we ingest caffeine, we are biasing our system towards the pro-energetic aspects of these cellular pathways.\\nNow, it's really important to understand that in biology, even if you block a receptor or you prevent the activity of an enzyme, and at least in this case, you end up with more cyclic AMP, more energy, you're not really getting more energy.\\nYou're actually borrowing energy against an overall system that is frankly non-negotiable.\\nWhat do I mean by that? Well, let's say that you were to wake up after six or eight hours of sleep and to drink a lot of caffeine and keep drinking caffeine throughout the day, throughout the day, blocking those adenosine receptors.\\nYes, you'll offset fatigue.\\nYou'll offset sleepiness because that adenosine simply can't function.\\nBut at the point where the caffeine becomes dislodged from the adenosine receptors, you will have a massive glut, a backlog of adenosine, and you will feel extra, extra sleepy.\\nSo really, there's no way to create more energy in your system.\\nReally what you're doing is you're changing the timing in which the sleepy signals and the more energetic signals are arriving.\\nAnd this is really important to understand as the backdrop to the various tools that we're going to get into next, in which you can use caffeine for enhancing mental performance and physical performance and other aspects of health.\\nBut it's very important to understand this concept that when you wake up in the morning, provided that you slept well enough the night before, your levels of adenosine will be about as low as they will ever be.\\nActually, in order to get your adenosine levels really bottomed out, you want to avoid caffeine in the first 90 to 120 minutes after waking.\\nWe'll talk about why that is because it turns out there's a way to completely clear adenosine out of your system in the hour or so after waking.\\nBut for most people, adenosine levels are going to be close to their lowest after a good night's sleep.\\nBut there's really no negotiating the accumulation of adenosine that's going to occur and going to bias you towards feeling more sleepy than you would otherwise that's going to occur throughout the day.\\nThere's really no way to eliminate adenosine.\\nAll you can really do is block its function.\\nSo it's sort of like borrowing energy against the fatigue that you will inevitably feel.\\nNow, this actually has very important socio-economical relevance.\\nBefore caffeine was regularly consumed by human beings, we were really slaves to the light-dark cycle.\\nAnd this was especially true before the presence of artificial lighting.\\nBut even before the advent of artificial lighting, humans were largely constrained to the outside light-dark cycle.\\nWe need to be active during the day and working during the day, and we need to be asleep at night.\\nCaffeine allows us to divorce ourselves from that circadian cycle.\\nCircadian just means about 24-hour.\\nCaffeine allows us to do that at least somewhat by way of increasing our alertness, that is spiking our alertness at various times throughout the day and even at night.\\nThis is how we can have shift workers, for instance, that can sleep during the day and then drink a strong cup of coffee at 8 p.m.\\nand then work into the night.\\nThat ability completely transformed our society.\\nNow, of course, the healthiest schedule, we know this with certainty, the healthiest schedule for brain and body is going to be alert during the daytime and asleep at night.\\nThere's no question about that.\\nShift workers run into all sorts of health problems.\\nAnd thank you, shift workers, for doing the important work that you do.\\nWe need you, air traffic controllers, paramedics, firefighters, police officers, et cetera.\\nBut we know that there are serious health consequences, negative health consequences, that is, for shift workers.\\nBut for most people out there, about 95% of people follow a typical schedule where they're awake during the day and asleep at night.\\nAnd yet it used to be before the advent of caffeine-containing beverages, that if you were sleepy in the afternoon, you either had to take a nap or battle that sleepiness.\\nThat your activity rhythms and your sleep rhythms were governed by these circadian changes in availability of sunlight and when you slept.\\nAnd you just didn't have the ability to ingest a beverage that would increase your levels of alertness because you block adenosine.\\nSo this is important to understand that nowadays, we certainly live in a time in which we use, in fact, 90% or more of adults and half or more of adolescents and teenagers use caffeine as a way to negotiate with, to borrow against this natural pattern of adenosine making us sleepy.\\nBut again, you're just offsetting the effects of sleepiness that adenosine causes.\\nYou can't eliminate the adenosine entirely.\\nThe important point is that adenosine as a pro-sleepy molecule is a non-negotiable aspect of your biology.\\nIn fact, it's so non-negotiable that every 24 hours, you are going to release adenosine and you're going to release adenosine in direct proportion to how long you've been awake.\\nSo the longer you've been awake, the more adenosine circulating in your system.\\nThere are really only a handful of ways to completely clear out adenosine.\\nThe major one being to get sleep.\\nThe other is to take a short nap, which of course is sleep, but it's shallow sleep or non-sleep deep rest.\\nSo-called NSDR has been shown to reduce levels of adenosine.\\nAnd there are certain things such as viewing morning sunlight, which because of its effects on cortisol can quote unquote clear out adenosine.\\nWe'll talk about this in more detail in a few minutes.\\nAnd there's also evidence that certain forms of exercise provided that it's brief and intense can also reduce adenosine, not just block its effects.\\nNow that we've talked about some of the incredible mechanisms by which caffeine changes our experience of life, increases alertness and mood, et cetera, I want to talk about the use of caffeine as a tool.\\nNow caffeine is a very potent and useful tool for enhancing mental health, physical health, and performance.\\nBut there are certain considerations one has to keep in mind, in particular dose.\\nNow, first off, not everybody will respond to the same dose of caffeine the same way, but we can reliably say that your body weight is a good measure by which you can estimate what a healthy, useful dose of caffeine would be.\\nSo for most people, ingesting one to three milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight is going to be the range in which caffeine can have positive effects without making us feel overly anxious and give us that feeling that we're jumping out of our skin and turn the otherwise positive experience of caffeine into an aversive one.\\nFor those of you that aren't familiar with thinking in terms of kilograms and normally thinking pounds, I'll just quickly give you some general estimations that, for instance, 100 kilograms equals 220 pounds.\\nSo for me, I weigh 100 kilograms.\\nThat means that one to three milligrams, again, milligrams, thousandths of a gram, one to three milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight would mean for me, I could safely ingest 100 to 300 milligrams of caffeine in a single dose, in a single drink, if that's the way I'm consuming it, or pill form, if that's the way that I'm consuming it.\\nAnd it's very likely that that will be a tolerable dose.\\nHowever, if you are not somebody that's accustomed to drinking caffeine on a regular basis, I suggest you start on the lower end of that one to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight range.\\nSo for instance, if you're somebody who weighs 50 kilograms, that's approximately 110 pounds, and you would be pretty comfortable ingesting somewhere between 50 and 150 milligrams of caffeine.\\nSo what I recommend is that people who are considering using caffeine as a tool, or who are already ingesting caffeine, start to think about the dosage of caffeine that you are ingesting or plan to ingest, and the timing in which you ingest that caffeine relative to certain tasks throughout your day, your waking and your sleep.\\nAnd we'll talk about that in just a moment.\\nBut the first step for you is to figure out how much you weigh in kilograms, and then to go to that number of one to three milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight.\\nAnd that's a good range in which you might want to explore the use of caffeine in a single application, meaning in a single dose.\\nNow, I do realize that some people out there are drinking coffee all day long, or having coffee in the morning, and then again in the afternoon.\\nWhat I'm referring to here is the ingestion of caffeine in a single bout, right? One cup of coffee, or two cups of coffee, for instance, to achieve that 100 to 300 milligram range, if that's what's appropriate for your body weight.\\nBut to avoid any confusion, when I talk about dosage of caffeine, what I'm really talking about is not the total amount of caffeine ingested per day.\\nI'm talking about the total amount of caffeine ingested in one sitting, or setting, that is.\\nAnd if you're somebody who's drinking caffeine multiple times throughout the day, you could imagine, for instance, let's say the appropriate dose for you in order to get an enhancement in mental performance or physical performance is 200 milligrams, and you are somebody who's doing some work in the morning, and you want to have that lift in the morning to be able to focus better, and you're doing some physical exercise in the afternoon, or vice versa, that you would ingest 200 milligrams of caffeine at two separate times per day, separated by about four hours.\\nNow, you don't have to separate them.\\nYou could put them two hours apart, for instance, but we'll talk about half-life of caffeine and so forth.\\nJust keep in mind that if you're ingesting 200 milligrams of caffeine, and that's the appropriate dose for you based on your body weight, and then you are ingesting another 200 milligrams of caffeine an hour later, you are effectively ingesting approximately 400 milligrams of caffeine, which is going to start exceeding the dose in which you can normally tolerate without feeling anxious and jittery.\\nWith all of that said, there is a range of tolerance for caffeine that's based on two things.\\nOne is a pre-existing disposition, that is whether or not your genetics and nervous system and the backdrop of your life, how much stress you're experiencing, tends to make you feel more anxious and alert and jittery before you ingest any caffeine.\\nAnd the other is how so-called caffeine adapted you are.\\nWe often hear about tolerance.\\nTolerance means something very specific.\\nIt's the ability to ingest more and more of something with a plateau that is a no increase or an actual reduction in the effectiveness of that thing.\\nBut here, we're not really talking about tolerance to caffeine.\\nWhat we're talking about is being caffeine adapted.\\nA simple way to understand whether or not you're caffeine adapted or not is that if you drink caffeine and it tends to increase your heart rate and make you feel more alert and a bit more anxious, then chances are you are not caffeine adapted, provided the amount of caffeine is within the healthy range for you, that is, the ranges we talked about a moment ago.\\nHowever, if you're somebody who drinks caffeine and you actually feel alert and relaxed, chances are you are caffeine adapted.\\nAnd so at various times during today's episode, I'll talk about people who are caffeine adapted and people who are not caffeine adapted.\\nWe'll talk about the use of caffeine every other day.\\nI know for you habitual caffeine drinkers, including myself, just the simple mention of that probably sounds aversive, but there is actually great utility to using caffeine every other day as opposed to every day.\\nBut just keep in mind that some people will drink caffeine and not get much of a lift from it at all.\\nOther people will drink caffeine and they will feel extremely anxious, even at dosages far lower than that one to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight range that I described a moment ago.\\nSo you have to take into account individual differences.\\nThat said, one to three milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight for a given sitting, for your morning coffee or your morning yerba mate tea is a good range from which to start.\\nAnd I do encourage you to go online and look up the various beverages and foods that you might be eating that contain caffeine.\\nFor instance, some people are surprised to discover that the coffee that they get from some of the more standard popular vendors out there, the small coffee or the medium coffee, for instance, can contain as much as 400 to 600 milligrams of caffeine.\\nAnd that the large coffee that is often sold at those commercial vendors can contain as much as one gram, 1,000 milligrams of caffeine.\\nNow you may be adapted to that such that it doesn't make you feel anxious.\\nBut if you wonder why you feel irritable and you get a headache when you don't get that caffeine or that amount of caffeine at precisely the time that you're used to getting it each day, that's because you are consuming quite large quantities of caffeine on a regular basis.\\nSo I do recommend whether or not you drink soda or coffee or tea that you figure out the source of that.\\nOkay, so figure out what vendor you purchase it from, what kind of coffee and go online and spend a little bit of time because the information is out there to discover what levels of caffeine you're actually ingesting.\\nNow, if you happen to be ingesting more than one to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight of caffeine, that's not necessarily bad.\\nHowever, you do want to be careful about ingesting very high levels of caffeine over long periods of time in your life because there can be issues that start to arise in particular, a bias towards higher levels of anxiety and depletion of certain electrolytes because caffeine is a diuretic can cause you to lose sodium and other things of that sort.\\nAnd also just from simply a dependent standpoint, it does appear that if you ingest high levels of caffeine that is exceeding the dosages that normally you could get away with and get just as much mental enhancing and physical enhancing benefits that you can cause some disruption to the microvasculature.\\nYou can bias yourself towards headaches, anxiety attacks and you can become actually quite irritable when you're not getting those higher levels of caffeine.\\nSo I do encourage you to figure out not just what an appropriate caffeine dosage would be for you, but also how much caffeine you might already be ingesting.\\nThe first tool I'd like to talk about is one that I've mentioned before on this podcast several times.\\nAnd it's something that if you haven't heard of will be very useful to you.\\nAnd if you have heard this tool before, I'm going to add some additional features to the description of this tool that should make this worthwhile for you as well.\\nAnd that is to delay your caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes after waking up on most days.\\nAnd I'll be very clear as to days in which you might want to ingest caffeine more closely to when you wake up.\\nWhy would you want to delay your caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes after waking? The answer to that is very simple.\\nMany people wake up in the morning, they drink caffeine within 10, 20, 30, sometimes within two minutes of waking and they feel more alert naturally.\\nThat makes sense because of the effects of caffeine in blocking the effects of adenosine that I talked about earlier and its effects on other neurotransmitter systems.\\nBut then what they find is that in the early afternoon, in particular after lunch, they experience a dramatic dip in their overall levels of energy, the so-called afternoon crash.\\nAnd in most cases, the way they respond to that is to ingest more caffeine, which indeed can increase their levels of mood and alertness.\\nHowever, as we'll soon talk about, there is a problem with ingesting caffeine in the afternoon if it falls within eight or 10, or dare I even say 12 hours of going to sleep.\\nAnd that is the caffeine ingested in the afternoon for most everybody, let's say for 95 plus percent of people disrupts the architecture and quality of their nighttime sleep.\\nAnd I should say that it doesn't necessarily impact their ability to fall asleep and maybe even sleep through the night, but that the depth and quality of that sleep is disrupted by consuming caffeine in the afternoon.\\nA little bit later, I'll talk about how you can offset some of those negative effects if you absolutely require caffeine in the afternoon.\\nBut there's a huge advantage to restricting your caffeine intake to the early part of your day, but not consuming caffeine within the first 90 to 120 minutes after waking.\\nIn fact, many people find that if they delay their caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes after waking up, that they feel more alert in the morning and they completely avoid that afternoon crash.\\nNow that said, many people, including myself, do need a short nap or non-sleep deep rest or other form of relaxation for 10 to 30 minutes in the afternoon.\\nThat is natural and healthy.\\nI'm not referring to the need for that when I refer to the so-called afternoon crash.\\nWhat I'm talking about in the afternoon crash is an inability to recover energy and focus and a need to consume more caffeine just to make it through the afternoon.\\nBy delaying caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes after waking, there are a couple of things that are accomplished.\\nFirst of all, you offset that afternoon crash and this is an effect that many people experience the very first time they start delaying their caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes after waking.\\nAnd the reason this works so well is the following.\\nAs I mentioned earlier, adenosine is a molecule that builds up the longer that we are awake.\\nIt is a molecule that is reduced or cleared from our system by sleep.\\nSo when we emerge from sleep, regardless of how long we've slept, our adenosine levels are lower than they were when we went to sleep the previous night.\\nIf you slept well enough and long enough, those adenosine levels can be very, very low, but they are never completely zero.\\nWhen you wake up in the morning, even if you're one of these people that springs out of bed and is ready to attack the day, and here I'm certainly not describing myself.\\nI'm not one of those people.\\nI tend to wake fairly slowly.\\nBut if you're one of those spring up and attack the day or you're one of the people who moves more slowly into your day, regardless, there's still some residual adenosine in your system.\\nAnd it's particularly the case if you did not get enough sleep or enough depth of sleep the night before, the correct ratios of slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.\\nAnd for those of you interested in optimizing sleep, I'll just refer you to our master your sleep episode of the Huberman Lab podcast, the perfect your sleep episode of the Huberman Lab podcast.\\nAnd we have a toolkit for sleep, all of which are available, zero cost, timestamped, et cetera at hubermanlab.com.\\nYou wake up in the morning and your adenosine levels are low, but they're not zero.\\nAnd if you didn't sleep that well or deeply enough the night before, you're going to have more adenosine in your system.\\nYou might think the logical thing to do is therefore to drink caffeine and to block the adenosine that's there.\\nBut what happens if you do that is there's an accumulation, a sort of glut of adenosine that hangs around.\\nAnd then in the afternoon, when the effects of that caffeine start to wear off, you will experience the so-called afternoon crash.\\nAs I mentioned earlier, there is a way to clear out the adenosine that's present when you wake up in the morning and to clear it out essentially completely without just blocking its receptors and letting it accumulate or hang around.\\nAnd the way to do that is to deliberately spike your cortisol.\\nNow, many of you have heard of cortisol, the so-called stress hormone as a bad thing.\\nAnd indeed chronically elevated cortisol is a bad thing.\\nIt depletes your immune system.\\nIt's bad for psychosocial effects.\\nIt tends to make us feel anxious and on and on.\\nBut cortisol itself is not bad.\\nCortisol is wonderful.\\nCortisol enhances the efficiency of the immune system.\\nIt makes us alert and focus.\\nIt stimulates our metabolism.\\nIt does a huge number of positive things provided that it is released in a circadian fashion, that is at the appropriate times every 24 hours and that it tends to peak very close to waking.\\nIn fact, one of the reasons you wake up in the morning assuming that you weren't woken up by some noise or sleeping in an environment that's too warm, et cetera, is that your cortisol levels start to rise.\\nAnd shortly after waking, your cortisol levels will start to reach their peak.\\nAnd when I refer to a cortisol pulse, that's just biology nerd speak for a rise and peak in cortisol.\\nYou want that cortisol pulse to occur early in the day close to waking.\\nAnd you want that for a couple of reasons.\\nFirst of all, if you don't restrict that cortisol pulse early in the day, it will tend to bleed into the later parts of the day.\\nAnd actually a late shifted cortisol peak is one of the hallmark signatures of depression, low level depression and serious depression.\\nAnd it can start to disrupt sleep and certainly can disrupt mood, metabolism and your immune system.\\nSo you want that cortisol peak early in the day.\\nHow do you ensure that that happens? Well, you wake up in the morning and whether or not you're a bounce out of bed type or you're more groggy, you know, kind of wade slowly into the day type like I am, you wake up and you don't ingest caffeine, fine and in fact, beneficial to hydrate with water and electrolytes.\\nTerrific, in fact, I would say, necessary to get bright light in your eyes, ideally from sunlight.\\nI've talked about this many, many times before on the podcast.\\nIf you wake up before the sun comes out, then turn on bright artificial lights.\\nBut then certainly once the sun is out and even on cloudy days, in fact, especially on cloudy days, get outside for anywhere from five to 20, maybe even 30 minutes, do some work outside, take your breakfast outside.\\nIf you're a breakfast eater, get something done outside, even if it's just to get outside and get bright light in your eyes, why? Well, because it's been shown in studies on humans that getting bright light in your eyes in the first hour after waking or as soon as possible after waking, increases the peak of that cortisol pulse by 50%, five zero.\\nAnd that cortisol pulse, yes, increases mood, yes, increases alertness, but it does one other very important thing, which is that through an indirect pathway, it can clear out any residual adenosine that might be present in your system when you wake up in the morning.\\nAgain, this is going to be especially important for those of you that are not getting as much sleep or as much quality sleep as you would like.\\nIt's going to be very important for you to get that morning bright light, ideally from sunlight, get that cortisol peak going.\\nOther ways to increase that cortisol peak would be to do some physical activity.\\nIf you don't have time to do a full workout, well then getting some movement, 10 minutes of skipping rope or even five minutes of skipping rope or jumping jacks or walking if that's all you have time for, ideally while getting the sunlight in your eyes.\\nBut that's going to zero out the adenosine present in your system.\\nIf, however, you were to wake up and immediately drink caffeine, caffeine itself can stimulate the release of cortisol a little bit more than it would otherwise be present in your system.\\nBut by blocking those adenosine receptors and because of the indirect effects of caffeine on the cortisol system, you actually are reducing the clearance of adenosine that would otherwise occur.\\nSo I realize that's a mouthful.\\nJust to be very clear, if you wake up and you ingest caffeine right away, you're blocking the adenosine receptor but you're not clearing it out.\\nYou're also preventing cortisol from having its normal increase in rise such that it can directly clear out adenosine because cortisol can clear out adenosine.\\nAnd that's what you want.\\nYou want to be at maximum alertness and focus in your morning and throughout your day.\\nAnd by delaying your caffeine to 90 to 120 minutes after waking, you set up your system so that you get that morning cortisol peak, ideally a peak that's even greater because you're getting your bright light viewing.\\nAnd then when you ingest your caffeine 90 to 120 minutes after waking, not only will you be craving it just a little bit, but you will be drinking that caffeine on an already existing backdrop of increased alertness for two reasons.\\nOne is adenosine is zeroed out and your cortisol peak is higher.\\nAnd so now when you ingest caffeine, you can actually ingest levels of caffeine that are a little more reasonable that almost with certainty are going to fall in this one to three milligrams per kilogram dosage and will allow you to feel really alert and will carry that alertness well into the afternoon hours without the need to drink more caffeine and thereby will prevent you from drinking caffeine and disrupting your nighttime sleep.\\nAnd of course, by getting better nighttime sleep, you're going to zero out your adenosine even more.\\nSo what I'm describing here are essentially two tools.\\nI'm telling you to get morning sunlight and maybe some exercise in conjunction with that, even if it's brief exercise.\\nBut the main tool of delaying caffeine 90 to 120 minutes after waking has immediate effects, but it also sets in motion a cascade or domino falls that lead to better sleep and more wakefulness the next night and the next day and so on and so forth.\\nNow I realize there are some people who just simply cannot or will not delay their caffeine 90 to 120 minutes after waking for whatever reason.\\nFirst off, let me say that if you are somebody who likes to wake up and do very intense exercise within the first 90 minutes after waking, well, in that case, it would be appropriate to ingest your caffeine just prior to doing that exercise.\\nNot a problem, not a problem.\\nBut you should expect that the combination of drinking caffeine very shortly after waking plus exercising very intensely shortly after waking will increase the intensity of that early afternoon and afternoon fatigue that you feel.\\nNow, for some people, that's a great thing.\\nThey can afford to take a nap or do non-sleep deep rest, step away from work and so forth.\\nIn that case, I strongly encourage you to do whatever it is that allows you to get regular exercise because regular exercise is going to be very beneficial.\\nIn fact, we did an entire episode called Toolkit for Fitness that describes a couple of different, but really one main structure that allows you to get the appropriate amount of resistance training and cardiovascular training and flexibility training throughout the week.\\nI happen to follow that program and it works very well and it does involve some of those workouts to come very early in the morning shortly after waking.\\nAnd in those cases, I do ingest caffeine just prior to those.\\nSo within 10, 20 minutes of waking.\\nHowever, on other days, I personally delay my caffeine intake 90 to 120 minutes and I've done that to great benefit.\\nAnd most people, if not all people that try that have reported the same.\\nI should mention that some people will find getting out to that 90 minutes to be excruciatingly difficult because they're so accustomed to ingesting caffeine close to waking up.\\nIn that case, maybe just push out your caffeine intake by about 15 minutes each day until you hit that 90 to 120 minute mark.\\nAnd that will make it much easier.\\nIt might take you a week or so to get there, but once you get there, you'll find it to be quite easy to maintain.\\nThe other thing is that if you are somebody who insists on drinking caffeine very shortly after waking, I would encourage you to drink half of your caffeine then and then the other half of your caffeine about an hour later.\\nThat also will help offset some of the afternoon crash for reasons related to the so-called kinetics of caffeine.\\nCaffeine has a quarter life of about 12 hours.\\nThat means that if you were to ingest a cup of coffee at let's say 8 a.m. and let's say 100 milligram coffee, just for sake of simplicity, that about 25% of that caffeine action, we wouldn't really say 25 milligrams, but about 25% of that caffeine action will still be present at 8 p.m. that night, which is pretty remarkable.\\nSo there's a long arc of caffeine effects and this is why it can impede sleep if we take caffeine in the afternoon.\\nBut again, if you're somebody who wakes up and you really need caffeine right away and you refuse to do this 90 to 120 minute delay thing that I'm talking about, well then in that case, I would drink half of your caffeine upon waking and then a little bit more or the other half about an hour later, and that will extend the arc of that caffeine effects such that you don't need it again in the afternoon because you won't experience the afternoon crash.\\nBecause of the way caffeine works, I should mention that if you ingest caffeine on an empty stomach, it will have a more potent stimulant effect.\\nThat will also tend to increase the level of jitteriness that caffeine can produce.\\nLater, I'll talk about ways to offset that jitteriness, but I'll just tell you one tool now.\\nMany people opt to take 100 milligrams of theanine as a way to offset some of that jitteriness.\\nTheanine will reduce the jitteriness of caffeine, which is why many energy drink manufacturers and even some coffee manufacturers are now putting theanine in energy drinks and in ground coffee because, no surprise, it allows people to consume more of that beverage and thereby purchase more of that beverage, which is what these vendors want, without feeling overly anxious and jittery.\\nSo you can take Pilform Theanine if you want with your caffeine.\\nI don't tend to do that.\\nRather, I control the total dosage of my caffeine.\\nI do tend to consume caffeine on an empty stomach because I do restrict my caffeine intake to the early part of the day.\\nAnd I generally eat my first meal somewhere around 11 a.m.\\nAnd then I generally eat my last meal sometime around 8 p.m. or so.\\nThose are averages, I would say, plus or minus an hour.\\nAnd that's not because I'm religiously following any kind of time-restricted feeding.\\nThat tends to work best with my schedule and my appetite.\\nBut again, that's a general theme.\\nThere are days in which I wake up and I'm very hungry and I might ingest something, a small snack or something, or if I'm meeting somebody for breakfast, sometimes I'll have breakfast, sometimes I won't, and so on and so forth.\\nThe point is that you can get away with drinking less caffeine to get the stimulant effect if you do it on an empty stomach.\\nAnd if you're somebody who likes to exercise on an empty stomach, and I'm one of those people, well then, ingesting caffeine just prior to exercise can be a fantastic tool.\\nA little bit later, we'll talk about some of the physical performance-enhancing effects of caffeine, but I'll just briefly jump to a point about that as we relate to morning exercise.\\nIf you are somebody who regularly ingests caffeine, and we can define regularly by, if you've ingested caffeine every day for the last two weeks, you're a regular consumer of caffeine.\\nWhereas if you're somebody who only ingests caffeine somewhere between two and four times per week, well then, you are not a regular consumer of caffeine.\\nYou're an intermittent user of caffeine.\\nWell, if you're somebody who's a regular user of caffeine, the performance-enhancing effects of caffeine are going to be most dramatic if you take two or three days off from drinking caffeine, which to my mind, I don't want to call myself a caffeine addict, but a regular caffeine user, that's a horrible notion to me.\\nIt is an aversive notion because I do like the effects of caffeine so much.\\nBut if you really want to see the maximum performance enhancing effects of caffeine, you'll do either one of two things.\\nYou will either abstain from caffeine for a few days or three days prior to ingesting caffeine, or you will use caffeine on an empty stomach.\\nIt's very clear that caffeine on an empty stomach enhances both the mental and physical enhancing effects of caffeine.\\nAnd of course, all of that has to be stated on the backdrop of consideration that if you, you're very, very hungry, it can make it hard to concentrate and so on and so forth.\\nSo I'm not encouraging people to starve themselves by any means, certainly don't do that.\\nBut if you want to maximize the performance enhancing effects of caffeine, you will consume it on an empty stomach.\\nAnd then as a final point to that, caffeine is a diuretic, it causes us to lose fluid and along with that fluid to excrete sodium because of the effects of caffeine on various processes within the kidney.\\nSo one thing that works very well to maintain mood and alertness, longer given a certain amount of caffeine intake and to avoid the jitteriness and what can sometimes feel like a crash or low blood sugar feeling or even blurry vision is to make sure that you consume at least an equal volume of water with your caffeine.\\nAnd ideally that water would contain maybe a small pinch of salt or some sort of electrolyte drink or powder rather.\\nFor me, I use Element, full disclosure, they are a podcast affiliate and sponsor, but you don't need to do that.\\nYou could simply just have a glass of water alongside your coffee or espresso or your yerba mate and just put a small pinch of sea salt in that or even just plain table salt.\\nAnd that will help offset some of the jitteriness of caffeine.\\nA lot of people think that when they ingest caffeine, they get the jitteriness and crash because their blood sugar is low.\\nAnd while that can be the case, oftentimes it's simply because of the excretion of sodium that's occurred when they've ingested caffeine.\\nSo I encourage you to hydrate well and to hydrate with something that contains a little bit of sodium.\\nObviously not so much that increases hypertension or something of that sort, but a small amount of sodium or an electrolyte drink like Element and there are other electrolyte drinks out there that can accomplish the same, of course.\\nJust a couple of quick notes about theanine because there are a growing number of products out there that contain theanine.\\nAnd there's certainly a growing number of people out there who are using theanine for the effect that I described before, which is to offset some of the jitteriness associated with caffeine containing beverages or foods.\\nAnd of course, I should mention that I've talked about the effects of theanine on sleep at that sleep toolkit that you can find as a free download.\\nYou don't even have to sign up for anything.\\nYou can just download it from hubermanlab.com, go to the menu, go to newsletter, you'll see the toolkit for sleep.\\nYou'll see that the so-called sleep stack that I use and recommend includes magnesium threonate, something called apigenin and theanine.\\nAlthough that sleep stack is designed to be taken 30 to 60 minutes prior to sleep.\\nAnd I make the point there and I'll make it again here that ingesting theanine prior to sleep is not a good idea.\\nIf you are somebody who tends to have very vivid dreams, night terrors or night sleepwalking, excuse me, et cetera.\\nIn that case, eliminate theanine from the sleep stack.\\nHowever, a number of people are using theanine and products are using theanine to offset jitteriness from caffeine containing products during the daytime, daytime consumption that is.\\nA couple of notes about theanine.\\nTheanine is something that is present in green tea.\\nIt's now been created as a supplement.\\nIt's what's called a non-protein amino acid.\\nSo while there are amino acids in proteins, there are of course amino acids in non-proteins and theanine is one such non-protein amino acid.\\nTheanine tends to stimulate the so-called glutamate and glutamine pathway.\\nIt's actually very similar to glutamate and glutamine.\\nAnd it has a lot of effects on a lot of different aspects of the nervous system.\\nBut the general effect of theanine is to compete for the receptors for certain neurotransmitters and the neurotransmitters I'm referring to are all excitatory neurotransmitters, things like glutamate, and they govern a tremendous amount of our daily thinking and action and feeling, et cetera, because they're present at so many connections between neurons in the brain.\\nTheanine competes for the receptors for glutamate and tends to reduce our overall levels of alertness.\\nSo really when people take theanine along with caffeine, what they're doing is they're really taking a slight, I don't want to call it depressant to the point where it misleads people and makes people think that it will make you depressed.\\nThe word is a little bit misleading, but tends to reduce or blunt some of the more excitatory pro alertness actions of neurons in the brain.\\nSo when you take it alongside caffeine, tends to quote unquote even things out a bit.\\nI should mention that the dosages of theanine that are effective for offsetting the jitteriness of caffeine is 200 to 400 milligrams.\\nAnd the studies that I was able to find showed that essentially up to 900 milligrams per day can be safe, but that's a very high dosage of theanine.\\nIn fact, so much so that it might increase sleepiness to the point where it wouldn't feel good.\\nThere are also some positive effects of daytime consumption of theanine that are independent of reducing the jitteriness of caffeine.\\nFor instance, there's a study demonstrating that 17 days of ingesting theanine at these 200 to 400 milligram dosage of one to three times per day can reduce depression and anxiety.\\nThere are also some good data out there showing that theanine can have positive effects on endothelial cells, so blood vessels, capillaries, and so on, and increase some of the function of blood vessels, allowing them to pass more blood through them and give them a little bit more elasticity, if you will.\\nSo theanine has certain pro sleep effects if it's taken prior to sleep.\\nIt can enhance the quality, depth, and duration of sleep.\\nAgain, if you're a sleepwalker or somebody who has extremely vivid dreams from which you wake up in the middle of the night, probably best to leave out theanine or maybe reduce the dosage down to 100 milligrams, and if that's still too much, then eliminate it completely.\\nBut theanine can be terrific for enhancing quality, depth, and duration of sleep.\\nIt can also reduce the jitteriness associated with caffeine-containing beverages and foods, and it has certain antidepressant and pro-endothelial effects.\\nThat is, it can offset depression, it can offset anxiety, although those are minor effects, okay, subtle effects, and it has been shown to improve endothelial cell, that is, vessel and capillary function and structure, in ways that can be beneficial for both brain and body.\\nNow, one final point about theanine that's worth paying attention to is that the kinetics of theanine are such that you don't need to take theanine every time you ingest a caffeinated beverage.\\nWhen we ingest caffeine, the peak effects of caffeine occur about 30 minutes after we drink it, and there I'm assuming one takes it all at once, and this is a key point that we'll come back to later, rather than sipping your coffee slowly over a couple of hours or an hour.\\nIf you drink all 200 or 300 milligrams of caffeine in your coffee, or 600 milligrams of your coffee, if you're getting one of those commercial coffees, and you take theanine along with it, theanine will block some of the jitteriness and anxiety-inducing effects of caffeine that can occur for much longer than the effects that caffeine lasts.\\nSo the peak in theanine occurs about an hour after ingestion.\\nI suppose if you want to get really fancy and really dial in the kinetics, you could ingest theanine about half hour before you ingest your caffeine, but I think that's getting a little bit excessive in terms of controlling your micro environment, if you will.\\nI think it would be perfectly fine to take a 100 to 200 milligram capsule of theanine along with your coffee or tea and so forth, and just realize that if you drink more caffeine or you extend your caffeine intake over several hours, that you don't necessarily have to take theanine repeated times throughout the day.\\nI'd like to take a brief

instance, one of the major myths around caffeine is that it can increase osteoporosis.\\nTurns out that while there is a relationship, of course, between calcium and osteoporosis, that is reductions in bone density, and it is the case that caffeine can extract calcium from certain tissues, the large scale studies that are out there essentially prove that if people are ingesting enough calcium through their diet, which most everybody is, although certainly there are some people that need to supplement calcium or make it a point to consume more calcium containing foods, but assuming that you are getting adequate levels of calcium, there is no direct relationship between caffeine intake and osteoporosis, at least not that I'm aware of.\\nI know this was debated for a number of years in the literature, but the literature seems to have arrived at a general consensus now that caffeine itself is not going to create or exacerbate osteoporosis provided people are getting enough calcium through their diet, that is through foods, through supplementation or both.\\nSome of the other myths around caffeine are that, for instance, caffeine will reduce testosterone levels or will reduce estrogen levels.\\nOther myths out there are in exact opposite to that, that caffeine will increase testosterone levels in particular free testosterone levels.\\nThere've been some large scale studies addressing the hormone effects of caffeine.\\nThey are a little bit difficult to do.\\nI should just mention that caveat.\\nAnd the reason they are difficult to do is because 90% of adults are consuming caffeine.\\nAnd therefore you can imagine, it's very hard to find a control group to compare the caffeine consumers to.\\nIn particular, a control group that's well controlled for other things like lifestyle, diet, exercise, et cetera.\\nHowever, when one controls as well as one can for all the various factors that could impact hormones, what one discovers is that caffeine intake, at least at the dosages we talked about earlier, one to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight or even up to double that, that there are no consistent increases or reductions in testosterone or estrogen in men or women that can be directly attributed to the caffeine intake.\\nAnd I say directly attributed because in these association studies, one always has to wonder, for instance, if because people are ingesting more caffeine, they have more energy and therefore exercising more and exercise is known to have effects on testosterone, estrogen and other hormones, whether or not the effects of caffeine on those hormones is indirect and so on and so forth.\\nAnd this all just underscores the challenges of doing studies on humans in the wild, in their natural habitat of living, as opposed to an acute study as it's called to bring someone into the laboratory and studying them just for those hours or moments.\\nWith all that said, there does appear to be a relationship between caffeine intake and so-called sex hormone and binding globulin, which is a protein present in the body of both men and women that binds to the sex steroid hormones, testosterone and estrogen, and prevents them from being in their free or active form.\\nIt has been shown that ingestion of caffeine, even in the sorts dosage ranges that are considered safe and that we've been discussing, can increase sex hormone binding globulin such that it can slightly reduce overall levels of free testosterone and free estradiol in women.\\nNow those effects are relatively minor, but they do exist.\\nIf any of you are interested in reading further into the effects of caffeine on hormones, I'll just refer you to a couple of studies.\\nWe will link to this in the show note caption.\\nThe title of the study is consumption of caffeinated beverages and serum concentrations of sex steroid hormones in US men.\\nAnd within this study, there's a reference to a equally sized empowered study done on women, both of which converged on the same conclusion by examining more than a thousand, so in this case, 1,410 men or more than a thousand women, that there are increases in sex hormone binding globulin associated with increased intake of coffee in particular, but they were able to narrow that down specifically to ingestion of caffeine.\\nSo it's not coffee per se that's causing the increase in sex hormone binding globulin, it's actually caffeine itself.\\nNow, again, the increases in sex hormone binding globulin were not so significant that at least to my mind, they seem like a concern, although I think that it is worth noting that if you're going to consume caffeine, that you'd probably want to consume caffeine in a way that is in dosages and with the sort of timing that will allow you to get away with ingesting caffeine, but not to excess.\\nSo to derive the benefits of caffeine without, for instance, driving up sex hormone binding globulin too far.\\nNow, why would that be a good idea? Why would you want to make sure that you have enough free testosterone and free estrogen? Well, some of that is related to the acute effects of those hormones in terms of wellbeing and libido and strength and mood, et cetera.\\nBut some of it is also related to the longer term effects of sex steroid hormones.\\nMany people don't realize this, but the sex steroid hormones operate on the receptors at the surface of cells to have immediate effects, but they also can enter cells and actually go into the nucleus of cells where the DNA of those cells are contained and control gene expression in those cells.\\nSo the sex steroid hormones, testosterone and estrogen are controlling a lot of different cellular functions over long periods of time.\\nSo blunting their action over long periods of time is probably not a great idea.\\nBut again, at the dosages of caffeine that we're talking about today, one to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight, unlikely that the increases in sex hormone binding globulin that one experiences from that are going to be detrimental.\\nAnd certainly the positive effects of caffeine that one experiences in terms of mental performance and physical performance, and the fact that it increases energy to do the sorts of things like exercise that we know can profoundly improve hormone profiles.\\nTwo-fold or three-fold improvement in hormone profiles.\\nIn that case, it seems that ingesting caffeine is overall a good thing, provided it's not in excess.\\nThat also makes this the appropriate time to mention one of the more impressive effects of caffeine, which is on overall levels of mood and mental health.\\nThere are several studies on this, but the one that I'm particularly fond of was published in 2019 in Psychiatry Research, and the title of the paper is Inverse Association Between Caffeine Intake and Depressive Symptoms in U.S. Adults.\\nAnd these are data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\\nAnd the basic takeaway is that while, of course, there are a ton of different factors that are going to relate to whether or not people are depressed or not, life circumstances, genetics, and so on, that, and here I'm quoting from the study, caffeine's psychostimulant properties, that just means the ability to make us feel more alert and positive, appear to protect against depressive symptoms.\\nAnd, of course, they acknowledge that additional studies are needed.\\nBut this is just one of several studies pointing to the fact that people who regularly ingest caffeine in the appropriate dosages do seem to enjoy an anti-depressive effect overall.\\nI wouldn't want anyone to consider caffeine a treatment for severe depression, or at least not alone a treatment for severe depression.\\nBut provided the anxiety-inducing effects of caffeine can be kept in check through use of theanine or making sure that the dosage and the timing of caffeine ingestion is correct, then caffeine overall seems to be good for our mood and prevent depression, or at least keep depression at bay when depression might otherwise surface or be more severe.\\nAnd, of course, there are the don'ts surrounding caffeine intake.\\nAs it relates to sleep, and to put it very simply, sleep, that is getting enough quality sleep each night, is the foundation, it is the bedrock of mental health, physical health, and performance.\\nSleep and the power of sleep far exceeds any nootropic you could ever take, any prescription drug you could ever take, any health-promoting tool for your immune system, your metabolism, your mental function, your physical function you could ever take.\\nSleep is the bedrock.\\nI know a lot of people experience challenge with sleep.\\nNobody is perfect about sleep.\\nThat's important to keep in mind.\\nI think a good goal is to get enough quality sleep of sufficient duration, 80% of the nights of your life, and then as much as possible to make sure that the remaining 20% of nights, you're not getting enough sleep for good reasons, as opposed to hard reasons.\\nGood reasons would include raising children.\\nThat's important.\\nAfter all, every species desires to make more of itself and to preserve and extend the wellbeing of its young.\\nSo child rearing is a perfectly legitimate reason to get a lack of sleep, but you really want to strive to get quality sleep most nights of your life, which means that even if you're somebody who can quote unquote drink an espresso and then fall right asleep, that you avoid caffeine intake in the 12 hours prior to sleep.\\nI realize not everyone will be able to do that.\\nIn fact, I sometimes violate that.\\nSo I tend to go to sleep around 10 p.m. every night, sometimes 11, occasionally 12 midnight, but usually around 10 p.m. every night.\\nI confess that my last ingestion of caffeine is not always 10 a.m. or prior to that.\\nSo sometimes I will have caffeine up until 11 a.m.\\nor maybe noon, and very, very rarely I'll have an afternoon coffee or espresso or non calorie containing soda or tea or something of that sort.\\nBut I really try to restrict my caffeine intake to the early part of my day, that is before noon, given that I go to sleep around 10 p.m. each night.\\nAnd I strongly encourage everyone out there to try and limit their afternoon caffeine intake.\\nThis is something that Dr. Matt Walker, who's an expert sleep researcher out of University of California, Berkeley, psychology and neuroscience department there, author of the incredible book, Why We Sleep.\\nHe's been on this podcast, many other podcasts talking about the importance of sleep.\\nHe will remind us, and I'll remind you now, that the quarter life of caffeine is 12 hours.\\nI mentioned this earlier, but I'm going to repeat it again.\\nAnd that means that if you ingest caffeine at noon, 25% of its effects, more or less, okay, I'm using broad stroke here to talk about quarter life, 25% of that is still going to be bioactive at midnight that night, which will disrupt the early phase of your night, the amount of slow wave sleep, which then in turn will disrupt the amount of rapid eye movement sleep, which will disrupt your emotional processing during the following day and so on and so forth, okay? None of this is to say that if you have the occasional cup of coffee in the afternoon, that's going to completely demolish your sleep wake cycle forever.\\nBut I really encourage people to avoid drinking caffeine in the 12 hours prior to sleep.\\nAnd if you can't do that within the 10 hours prior to sleep, and if you can't do that within the eight hours prior to sleep, so really try and limit your caffeine intake in the eight to 12 hours prior to going to sleep at night.\\nAnd of course, slow wave sleep, AKA deep sleep, is the sleep that's associated with somewhat mundane dreams, which makes it sound like it might not be that important, but it's also the sleep that's associated with growth hormone release, which is important for protein synthesis, repair of all bodily tissues and metabolism, and slow wave sleep is also critically attached to your immune system's ability to clear out bacteria and viruses that might otherwise infect your tissues.\\nNow I'd like to talk about caffeine and performance, and that includes both mental performance and physical performance.\\nNow I'd like to talk about caffeine and its positive effects on performance when used correctly.\\nAnd here we are referring to both mental performance and physical performance.\\nThe exploration of caffeine as a pro-performance tool has been explored since the 1930s, at least that's some of the earliest documented literature on this.\\nAlthough I have to imagine, given that people have been using caffeine for much longer than that, that long ago somebody realized that by ingesting a certain plant, that they felt much more alertness and were able to hunt and gather or do any number of different things better, and as a consequence, decided to consume more of that plant.\\nNow, these days we consume a lot of caffeine in the form of coffee and tea mainly, and some people consume it in the form of caffeine tablets or energy drinks, et cetera.\\nAcross the board, one finds that caffeine intake at a level of one to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight improves reaction time.\\nThat is, it reduces the amount of time to take a physical action or to answer a question correctly with a verbal response.\\nIt can also improve coordination, it can also improve memory, although I do want to mention that whereas most studies of the effects of caffeine on improving mental and physical performance involve taking caffeine at one to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight before the mental task or physical task, there is also a pro-performance effect of caffeine on memory if one takes caffeine after learning certain material, or I should say being exposed to certain material.\\nWe'll come back to that in a few minutes.\\nIf one examines reaction time, mood, alertness, focus and memory, or the ability to call up information from memory or physical dexterity, power output, endurance, and overall feelings of wellbeing during exercise and exertion, caffeine has been shown in numerous studies in both men and women to improve all of those metrics significantly.\\nSo this is all just to say that caffeine is an incredible performance enhancing tool.\\nNow, what's not obvious from the statement that caffeine is a performance enhancing tool across the board and in men and women and in different contexts is that the way in which caffeine is taken is very important.\\nBecause 90% or more of adults consume caffeine, finding controls for studies of caffeine is really challenging.\\nThat is finding people who don't ingest caffeine regularly is a very challenging task for the researcher.\\nAnd as a consequence, many of the studies of caffeine on human beings involve depriving regular caffeine users of caffeine and then examining the effects of caffeine given after a period of say five to 15 days of abstinence in a person that is essentially experiencing mild withdrawal symptoms because they haven't had the caffeine that they were used to getting.\\nSo this is an important point.\\nAnd it's a point that likely exacerbates the observed pro-performance effects of caffeine.\\nNow, all of that isn't necessarily a problem provided you keep it in mind.\\nAnd it actually points to a way in which even if you're a regular caffeine user, you can extract more of the benefits of caffeine.\\nThe simplest way to do this, for instance, is to look back to what we talked about earlier in terms of the need to have most of your cortisol increase restricted to the hour or hours just after waking in terms of mood and alertness and performance.\\nOne of the ways to increase the peak of that cortisol early in the day is to consume caffeine shortly after that peak occurs.\\nAnd this was really nicely demonstrated in a study entitled caffeine stimulation of cortisol secretion across the waking hours in relation to caffeine intake levels.\\nWe will provide a link to this study.\\nIt's a somewhat complicated study because they looked at a bunch of different times of day for caffeine intake.\\nAnd I should mention this study, they use this 300 milligrams per day or 600 milligrams per day.\\nSo that's quite high, although for people of sufficient body weight and who are accustomed to taking caffeine, it's certainly not going to be in excess of what a lot of people out there are taking.\\nBut basically what they observed was the following.\\nCortisol responses to caffeine are reduced, but not eliminated in people who consume caffeine on a daily basis.\\nWhat this means is that if you wake up and as I recommended earlier, you avoid drinking caffeine for the first 90 to 120 minutes after waking, but you do get some sunlight or other bright light in your eyes in that time, maybe even get some exercise in that time, which would be even better.\\nAnd then you ingest caffeine, you will get a further increase in cortisol, which provided it's restricted to the early part of the day is a good thing overall for mood and alertness.\\nSo this is a simple performance enhancing tool, which is to stack caffeine on the tail of that early cortisol peak.\\nI should also mention, however, that in this study, they had people do a five-day caffeine abstinence prior to being tested with 300 milligrams or 600 milligrams of caffeine.\\nSo the simple tool to extract from this and other studies like it, is that if you want to experience the maximum alertness promoting effects of caffeine, when you ingest it early in the day, you would abstain from caffeine for five days and then ingest caffeine 90 to 120 minutes after waking.\\nI would still hope that you were doing all the other things that I described, morning, sunlight, exercise, et cetera, correctly, but regardless, it's very clear that a five-day abstinence from caffeine, however painful that might be, will increase the performance enhancing effects of caffeine when you take caffeine on that sixth day.\\nNow, I'm sure many of you out there are saying, why would I ever want to abstain from caffeine for five days in order to just get this six-day performance enhancing effect? Well, there are a couple of reasons for doing that.\\nPerhaps you're planning to travel to a new time zone and you want to use caffeine as a stimulant to stay up during the day in the new time zone.\\nThat's a somewhat unusual case.\\nOthers of you might be interested in the pro-physical performance effects of caffeine.\\nWe'll talk more about these in a little bit, but you want to get the maximum strength increase or the maximum endurance increase from ingesting, in this case, 300 to 600 milligrams of caffeine.\\nWell, in that case, abstaining from caffeine for five days will greatly exacerbate the pro-performance effects of caffeine when you take it on that sixth day.\\nAlthough, admittedly, those five days are likely to be pretty painful if you're a regular caffeine user.\\nAnother variation on this, however, might be to have the amount of caffeine that you ingest on a daily basis and then go back to your regular level of caffeine intake on that day in which you need the caffeine to really boost your mood, energy, and performance.\\nAnother reason why you might want to abstain from caffeine or reduce your caffeine intake for a period of time and then go back to your regular caffeine intake is simply to identify how much of an effect caffeine is really having on your overall level of daily functioning and mood.\\nThis was something that was actually covered in beautiful detail in a book by Michael Pollan, All About Caffeine.\\nIt's available on Audible.\\nI really enjoyed that book.\\nIt describes his experience with the decision to completely abstain from caffeine for a period of months.\\nAlthough, I confess that after hearing that book, what it basically made me want to do is never quit drinking caffeine because it sounded as if, at least my interpretation was, that even after several weeks or months of abstaining from caffeine, that he still fantasized about the effects of caffeine.\\nBut he did mention that when returning to ingesting caffeine after a period of long abstinence, that it had almost a, let's not call it a psychedelic property, but it had such obvious effects on mood and alertness and feelings of wellbeing that it really highlighted for him the extent to which caffeine normally was allowing him to just function what he thought was normally.\\nSo in other words, many of us don't even really know what our normal basal level of cognitive and physical functioning is because we're ingesting caffeine on such a regular basis.\\nI confess that as much as I enjoyed that book and as intriguing as his description of caffeine abstinence and then the return to caffeine was, I don't intend to ever find out personally.\\nNow, a very good reason why you might want to abstain from caffeine for a deliberate period of time and then return to caffeine intake is for its physical performance enhancing effects.\\nAnd here we can look to a really interesting study, title of which is Time Course of Tolerance to the Performance Effects of Caffeine.\\nAnd what I like about this study is that while yes, it does say that abstaining from caffeine and then returning to caffeine intake can enhance physical performance in a very specific way.\\nIt also says that if you take caffeine regularly, you can still see the physical performance enhancing effects of caffeine, although they are not quite as robust as they would be had you abstained from caffeine.\\nThe design of the study is pretty straightforward.\\nThey had people either ingest three milligrams per kilogram of caffeine for 20 consecutive days.\\nMany people are already doing that, I realize, but they had people do that or ensure that they were doing that or others ingested a placebo for 20 days.\\nSo they abstained from caffeine without realizing it.\\nThen after that 20 days of either ingesting caffeine or a placebo, their peak performance was measured in terms of aerobic output, but prior to that measurement, they had caffeine, okay? So it's 20 days of caffeine and then a 21st day of caffeine and then the physical task on that 21st day, or it's 20 days of abstinence from caffeine.\\nAnd then on day 21, you get caffeine and you get the same physical test.\\nAnd what they discovered was that the ingestion of caffeine increased peak performance in this aerobic output dramatically if people had abstained from caffeine, but for people that had consumed caffeine all the way through up until that day, it still was effective to ingest caffeine on day 21, but not as effective as it would have been had they abstained.\\nAnd in fact, the magnitude of the, what they call ergogenic effect, which is the pro-performance enhancing effect of caffeine was higher on the first day than in subsequent days when they allowed people to continue caffeine intake.\\nSo the takeaway from this study is really straightforward.\\nIf you want to get the maximum physical performance enhancing effects of caffeine, you abstain from caffeine for 20 days.\\nThen on day 21, when you're going to do the physical thing, the task, you ingest caffeine about 30 minutes to an hour before you do that physical challenge.\\nNow, 20 days of abstinence is going to be rough for a lot of people.\\nThey certainly don't want to sign up for this study, in which case you might want to do five days of abstinence as we talked about before.\\nAnd then on day six is the day that you ingest caffeine and do the physical task.\\nThere are even some studies showing that you can abstain from caffeine for just two days, for just 48 hours.\\nAnd in particular, if you are a regular user of caffeine, this allows you to on day three, ingest caffeine at the dose that's appropriate for you and do the physical or I should mention mental performance task and perform significantly better than those that have been taking caffeine throughout the entire period leading up to the challenge.\\nSo you don't necessarily need to abstain for 20 days in order to get the pro performance effects of caffeine on day 21.\\nYou could do five days of abstinence prior or even two days of abstinence prior.\\nOr if that's intolerable to you, as it is in my mind to me, to just reduce your caffeine intake slightly or even perhaps have it, if you can tolerate that in the week or two weeks or maybe even three weeks proceeding some physical or mental challenge.\\nNow, again, this sort of implies that you're going up against a marathon or you're going up against a series of long tests, maybe standardized tests in one day.\\nThere, I just really want to point out that there is an abundant literature showing that people perform best on mental tests if they are in the state that they were when they studied for that material.\\nNow in college, I knew a number of people who took this to the extreme thinking that if they were to study under the effects of alcohol that they would be best off consuming alcohol prior to taking exams.\\nAnd it turns out to not be the case.\\nHere, we're talking in particular about psychostimulant effects of caffeine and other compounds.\\nSo don't think that you can drink or be under the influence of THC and then take when you study and then take an exam under the same influence and do just as well as you would had you not ingested anything.\\nPlease don't let that be the takeaway.\\nHowever, do let it be the takeaway that caffeine's effects are made more potent by a brief to not so brief period of abstinence prior to taking a dosage of caffeine.\\nAnd then the final point to make is that if you are somebody who is not accustomed to drinking caffeine, meaning you're hypersensitive to caffeine or you don't regularly ingest caffeine, please do not ingest caffeine on the day of any important mental or physical challenge or performance because what you will find is that because you are not caffeine adapted, you will experience changes in your thermal regulation, in your levels of anxiety and jitteriness and your levels of focus that could be very detrimental to mental or physical performance.\\nSo you don't want to throw yourself in the deep end by ingesting caffeine if you're not used to it.\\nAnd I should mention that for people that are not accustomed to ingesting caffeine or are very sensitive to caffeine, even 25 to 50 milligrams of caffeine in the amount that's found in, for instance, a piece of certain types of chocolate can actually cause anxiety.\\nSo be careful there.\\nHere I'm referring only to people that are accustomed with caffeine intake.\\nSo what I recommend is to explore the ergogenic effects of caffeine during your training and then to make a decision about what you can reasonably and reliably do in terms of abstinence and then pulse with caffeine on the day of the challenge.\\nI get a lot of questions as to whether or not caffeine has different effects on the nervous system and on performance in particular, depending on phases of the menstrual cycle.\\nSo I explored that in my research for this episode and I found two studies, both of which we will reference in the show note captions.\\nThe first one is entitled Caffeine Consumption and Menstrual Function.\\nSo it's actually the relationship between caffeine and menstrual function.\\nWe will do an entire episode about the menstrual cycle and menstrual function.\\nBut the other one, as it relates to performance, was published in 2020 in the European Journal of Nutrition, which is Ergogenic Effects of Caffeine on Picarobic Cycling Power During the Menstrual Cycle.\\nAnd the basic takeaway of this study, this is frankly a very nice study, showed that, quote, caffeine increased peak aerobic cycling power in the early follicular, pre-ovulatory, and mid-luteal phases of the menstrual cycle.\\nThus the ingestion, and again here, they use three milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body mass, might be considered an ergogenic aid for women who are in the menstrual cycle during all three phases of their cycle.\\nSo keep that in mind, women, for those of you that are regular users of caffeine or you're using caffeine to enhance physical performance, there does not seem to be any menstrual cycle phase-dependent effects of caffeine on performance.\\nThat is, caffeine seems to always increase physical performance, regardless of the phase of the menstrual cycle you might happen to be in.\\nI'd like to touch on a little bit more of the use of caffeine for enhancing mental performance.\\nYes, it is the case that ingesting one to three milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight in the 30 minutes or so prior to doing a memory task or sitting down to doing some studying or learning of any kind, physical or mental performance of any kind, is beneficial for all the reasons we talked about before related to dopamine and acetylcholine, et cetera.\\nBut it turns out that it is also the case that spiking one's adrenaline and other so-called catecholamines, so this would be dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, after a bout of learning, can greatly enhance memory for the information that one was trying to learn.\\nThat's right.\\nSpiking your adrenaline after learning can greatly increase memory for the material you're trying to learn.\\nIn fact, this is a practice that dates back centuries and was written about in a beautiful annual review of neuroscience on the biology of memory by James McGaugh, where he talks about medieval practices of children being taught information and then being thrown literally into cold water to stimulate the release of adrenaline.\\nAnd that increase in adrenaline, while the mechanism wasn't completely understood, it was understood that that sort of shock to the system from the cold water led to better memory and retention of the information that these children had been exposed to.\\nAnd it turns out the exact same thing is true for adults in the laboratory or kids in the laboratory.\\nAnd here I'm not suggesting throwing anyone into cold water.\\nIf you want to get into cold water, there's a reason we call it deliberate cold exposure on the podcast is that it should be deliberate and controlled by you, not by somebody else.\\nIf it's controlled by somebody else, that might be military screening or something.\\nBut here we're talking about deliberately increasing your levels of adrenaline and other catecholamines, dopamine, norepinephrine, et cetera.\\nYou can do that certainly by deliberate cold exposure with a cold shower or getting in up to your neck in cold water of any kind.\\nBut the other way to do that is to spike your adrenaline by ingesting one to three milligrams per kilogram of caffeine after sitting down to try and learn some material.\\nI confess that more often than not, I use caffeine the same way that most people use it, which is, okay, I'm going to sit down, I'm going to research information for a podcast or assemble some information for a paper or grant.\\nAnd I want to focus, so I will drink a cup of coffee at the beginning of that and maybe even throughout that or a couple of yerba mate at the beginning or throughout that, or I'll sip on one or both throughout trying to learn.\\nAnd that works quite well in terms of maintaining focus and alertness and retention of information.\\nBut it is indeed the case, that is the research supports the fact, and I've experienced the fact that if I abstain from caffeine while I'm trying to learn something, but then I drink caffeine immediately after.\\nSomewhat surprisingly to me, but certainly in a way that's consistent with the research literature, memory for the information that I was focused on prior to ingesting that caffeine is much greater.\\nAnd here I'm talking about it as a personal anecdote, but this is actually what the data point to both in animals and in humans.\\nAnd if you think about it, it makes perfect sense because the way that the memory systems of the brain are organized is that we go through life experiencing things, we encounter surprises, both good and bad.\\nWe go through the motions of things, both typical, mundane, exciting and novel and not novel.\\nAnd then every once in a while, something will happen that will spike our catecholamines, dopamine, typically if it's a positive surprise, adrenaline, which can be associated with both positive surprise or positive events and negative events or surprises.\\nAnd without fail, increases in the catecholamines tend to lock in memories for things that preceded the increase in those catecholamines.\\nAgain, the catecholamines being dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine, sometimes all three in combination, sometimes just two of those, sometimes just one of those depending on the experience.\\nSo it makes perfect sense that using caffeine at the end of a learning bout would enhance our memory for the information that we're trying to learn.\\nSo if you decide that you want to try and extract this performance enhancing effect of caffeine, what I recommend would be to try and abstain from caffeine for a day or two prior.\\nBut if you can't, to just continue with your normal caffeine intake.\\nBut then when you sit down to study or learn something to not ingest any caffeine as you do that, but then afterward to ingest caffeine.\\nNow, in theory, you could probably further enhance the memory encoding effects of adrenaline and the other catecholamines by drinking caffeine and then taking a cold shower, doing deliberate cold exposure if you really wanted to or had the ability to, or doing some sort of intense form of exercise.\\nAnd we'll talk in a moment about how caffeine exercise and the adrenaline system interact.\\nBut as a brief but relevant aside, brief bouts of intense exercise ranging from 10 to 50 minutes or so have been shown to improve memory for information that one was trying to learn prior to the intense exercise.\\nThis is work from Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab at NYU as well as other laboratories.\\nSome of the work that's being done at Stanford in the mind body laboratories.\\nAnd our laboratory points in the direction of these kinds of effects as well.\\nThey all come back to the same general neurochemical theme, which is that when we experience an increase in these catecholamines that include adrenaline, dopamine and norepinephrine, the memory systems of the brain flip on in a way that try to capture the information and the perceptions and the experiences that we were exposed to just prior to the increase in catecholamines.\\nAnd caffeine, but also exercise and also cold water.\\nAnd of course, any of those alone or in combination all increase the levels of catecholamines.\\nSo it makes perfect logical mechanistic sense as to why this would work.\\nAnd in fact, it does work.\\nIf you want to remember specific information, you might consider using caffeine as you move through and absorb and are exposed to that information.\\nBut you might also consider using caffeine after being exposed to that information because studies in animals and humans show that that is a potent way to increase memory for what you were just exposed to.\\nI should mention that what I just described also pushes back on something that I know a number of people perhaps have heard about and maybe even use, which is this notion of the nappuccino.\\nI remember hearing about this a few years back.\\nIt was a sort of trend, if you will.\\nThe trend involved drinking a cup of coffee or double espresso and then going down for a nap, typically in the afternoon and then waking up.\\nAnd the idea was that the caffeine would hit your system right at the time that you awake from the nap and that you would be better able to focus and exercise.\\nThere are a couple of things about that practice that I don't like.\\nFirst of all, it implies in most cases that you're napping and ingesting caffeine in the afternoon, which I realize for many students and for people that are comfortable staying up until the wee hours of the night and then waking up late the next day might be compatible with their schedule.\\nBut again, because of the sleep diminishing effects of caffeine, and we talked about earlier, not crazy about the idea of people ingesting caffeine in the late afternoon in order to perform better in the late afternoon, far better would be to restrict caffeine intake to the early part of the day as we talked about earlier.\\nThe other reason is that the data on things like non-sleep deep rest and naps in the afternoon.\\nAnd again, the rule here is that you don't have to nap, but if you want to nap, it's been shown that naps of 90 minutes or less or non-sleep deep rest protocols.\\nAnd you can find those, for instance, there's one with me speaking.\\nYou just put NSDR Huberman into YouTube.\\nYou can hear that it's completely zero cost.\\nThere are other NSDR scripts out there now, of course, if you prefer those.\\nThat those can all lead to increases in one of the catecholamines at least, which is dopamine.\\nThat's been shown in a really nice neurotransmitter labeling study, not from my laboratory, but from another laboratory, but also can improve mood focus and alertness on its own without the need to ingest caffeine prior to going into those states.\\nAnd in fact, ingesting caffeine prior to a nap or ingesting caffeine prior to NSDR is most certainly going to reduce the effectiveness of that nap and NSDR in restoring natural levels of alertness and focus that would lead to the performance enhancing effect.\\nSo I'm not such a fan of the so-called nappuccino, although if any of you out there have derived great benefit from it, definitely let me know your protocol and what you've experienced.\\nPut it in the comment section if you would.\\nI'd appreciate that.\\nThere's another very important and potent use of caffeine for enhancing performance.\\nAnd this relates not just to the dopamine and epinephrine and the arousal inducing effects of caffeine.\\nAnd it doesn't even just relate to the effect of caffeine on enhancing frontal lobe function.\\nIt does include all that, but it also includes those reinforcing effects of caffeine that we talked about at the beginning of the episode.\\nAnd the best way to illustrate these performance enhancing effects of caffeine that stem directly from its association with reinforcement is to highlight a study.\\nAnd the title of the study is blood dopamine level enhanced by caffeine in men after treadmill running.\\nAnd as the title suggests, this was carried out in men, but there's no reason to think that the same results wouldn't also be present in women.\\nThere are some sex dependent effects of caffeine I'll touch on just briefly at the end, but those are largely present in kids, that is adolescents and teens as opposed to adults.\\nSo this study is really interesting.\\nWhat they had people do was run on a treadmill and either ingest caffeine again, three milligrams per kilogram of body weight or to not ingest caffeine.\\nAnd then they looked at levels of dopamine and other neurotransmitters and hormones such as prolactin and cortisol.\\nAnd the basic takeaway is as the title suggests that exercise while on its own can increase cortisol in healthy ways, provided it's not too intense and too long.\\nLittle note here, if you have trouble recovering from exercise or you want to continue to derive the benefits from exercise in general, best not to do high intensity exercise for longer than 75 minutes or 90 minutes only being the outer threshold.\\nI realize that there are some genetic freaks out there or people that are chemically assisted that can recover from very intense long bouts of exercise, but most people don't do well long bouts of intense exercise on a regular basis and limiting their intense exercise to 60 minutes or less.\\nThat doesn't include the warmup is going to be beneficial.\\nSee the episode on a toolkit for fitness if you'd like details on that.\\nExercise is known to increase levels of dopamine, cortisol and other catecholamines and neurotransmitters very potently and things like testosterone and estrogen in ways that we know are beneficial to us.\\nAnd of course have all these positive effects on the musculoskeletal system and cardiovascular effects.\\nBut unbeknownst to most people ingesting three milligrams per kilogram of caffeine prior to exercise further increases the dopamine release associated with exercise specifically.\\nAnd this has two important effects.\\nFirst of all, that increase in dopamine is great because it provides a long lasting increase in focus alertness and motivation, not just during the exercise, but also after the exercise.\\nAnd second, it that is caffeine and dopamine in combination act as a reinforcer to make the experience of exercise and the period immediate after exercise more pleasant and in fact reinforcing.\\nSo in other words, one way to enjoy exercise more and to enjoy the activities that follow exercise more and to experience a genuine increase in dopamine that's beneficial for mood and alertness is to ingest caffeine prior to exercise.\\nNow, this is important because a number of people out there are exercising, love exercise, love eating great, love doing all the things that are beneficial for their health.\\nBut a number of people out there really don't like to exercise.\\nAnd that serves as a serious block for their willingness and their consistency to exercise.\\nIngesting caffeine gives us energy to exercise.\\nIt increases the release of neurochemicals and hormones that are good for us during exercise.\\nBut as I'm highlighting here, it also increases the reinforcement pathways associated with exercise.\\nThat is it creates a positive feeling about the general theme of engaging in exercise and it creates a general positive experience of the things that follow exercise.\\nSo I think this, if nothing else is a call for or support for the idea that ingesting caffeine as a performance enhancing tool makes perfect sense.\\nBut for those out there that don't enjoy exercise in particular, certain forms of exercise, ingesting caffeine can change your relationship to that exercise.\\nIn other words, make it more positive much in the same way that ingesting caffeine alongside a certain taste that would otherwise be neutral or maybe even negative can actually make the taste of that particular drink or food positive.\\nSo again, this brings us back to the reinforcing properties of caffeine that are subconscious.\\nIt's not just about the enhanced performance in the test or the enhanced performance on the treadmill or with the weights in the gym.\\nIt's enhanced feelings of mood and wellbeing that are genuine because of the effect of caffeine on certain neurotransmitter and hormone systems.\\nBut it also is creating an overall milieu of reinforcing all of the things that led into, occur during and occur after exercise.\\nI do want to point out something that's very important as it relates to combining things like caffeine and exercise in order to increase dopamine.\\nThis is something that came up in the episode that I did on dopamine motivation and drive, which turns out to be one of our most popular episodes.\\nAgain, you can find that at hubermanlab.com and links to all formats with timestamps, et cetera.\\nThis also came up in the episode on ADHD because of the relationship between ADHD and dopamine.\\nAnd that's this notion of dopamine stacking.\\nIn the episode on dopamine motivation and drive, I pointed out that while there are a near infinite number of things that can increase dopamine release, most notably positive surprise or positive anticipation or experiencing a win, certainly there are compounds, both drugs of abuse, food, sex and certain supplements that can increase dopamine to varying levels and to varying degrees, both healthy and unhealthy.\\nThat's all contained in that episode on dopamine motivation and drive.\\nBut what I pointed out is that if you are somebody who tends to experience difficulty with motivation, that so-called dopamine stacking, as I called it, might be something that you want to avoid.\\nWhat is dopamine stacking? Dopamine stacking would be combining a highly caffeinated energy drink that also includes the amino acid tyrosine, which is a precursor to dopamine, plus loud music, plus getting yourself really ramped up than an intense workout.\\nAll of that can be great if you do it every once in a while, but what you will quickly find is that the extent to which your dopamine peaks also dictates the extent to which your dopamine will drop after that peak.\\nAnd when I say drop, I mean drop below baseline.\\nSo a lot of people find that they stack a lot of things to peak their dopamine, then they experience a low and it does take some time for them to return to baseline.\\nAnd I highly recommend not engaging in activities or consuming compounds that are in attempt to accelerate that return to baseline because all it will do is drive that baseline lower and lower.\\nSo this requires being able to tolerate a drop in dopamine baseline for a period of time, et cetera.\\nNow, the reason I'm bringing this up now in the context of this caffeine episode is I just described a study in which using caffeine prior to exercise increases dopamine after exercise.\\nAnd so you might be saying, especially if you heard that earlier episode, wait, isn't that dopamine stacking? Aren't you encouraging me to stack my dopamine? Well, in some sense, yes, but keep in mind, I'm not suggesting that you do this every time you exercise.\\nSo just as in that earlier episode, I emphasized the fact that while stacking multiple stimuli, right, caffeine or energy drinks and music and et cetera, for exercise or for mental work or for any experience for that matter is okay to do every once in a while for most people, you don't want to get in the habit of doing it consistently every time you exercise or every time you go out, for instance.\\nAnd so you really want to be cautious.\\nThat is you want to protect your both baseline levels of dopamine and your peak levels of dopamine.\\nThat said, for people that want to experience an increase in mood alertness and performance, or who want to condition themselves because that's really what it is.\\nIt's conditioning yourself by the reinforcing effects of dopamine to increase your liking, or maybe even your loving of exercise, occasionally using caffeine or frequently using caffeine prior to exercise is fine, but be very careful.\\nAnd by being very careful, what I mean is pay attention to how you feel in the hours and days after that dopamine increase wears off.\\nSo for instance, if you ingest caffeine and then exercise very intensely and you're feeling great afterwards, but then eight hours later or the next day, you're feeling a little bit low, I suggest you don't go back and do the exact same thing right away.\\nI would give yourself a little bit of time to let that baseline of dopamine return to normal.\\nSo again, stacking different things, chemical and behavioral in order to increase dopamine can be done in a safe way that's beneficial to you depending on your goals, but be careful about not stacking too many stimuli for dopamine too often.\\nThat's the key.\\nEarly in the episode, I mentioned one possible caffeine consuming schedule that works very well, that doesn't fortunately subject you to long 20 day bouts or five day or even two day bouts of abstinence.\\nAnd that's the every other day schedule of caffeine.\\nIf you look at the half life of caffeine and you look at its effects on the dopamine system and its performance enhancing effects and how a period of abstinence can in fact, increase the performance enhancing effects of caffeine, but also take into consideration that caffeine can be habit forming and we can develop a sort of tolerance to caffeine.\\nWell, then what emerges from all of that is that being a person who consumes caffeine every other day can actually help you maximize most of the positive effects of caffeine without subjecting you to the kind of misery that occurs if you're accustomed to consuming caffeine every single day and then suddenly go into a two or five or 20 day abstinence.\\nSo I myself have never tried an every other day caffeine approach.\\nAlthough I'm considering doing it based on the literature that I've read and I'm considering doing it in a very specific way, which would be to only consume caffeine on the days in which I resistance train.\\nAnd since I tend to do that about three or four days per week, organized in a way that's every other day.\\nAgain, if you want to see the exercise schedule that I follow, including cardiovascular exercise and weight training and all the reasons and rationale for what I do and how it maps onto the scientific literature related to health span and life span, vitality, et cetera, you can find that at hubermanlab.com and we had a toolkit for fitness that ought to be posted to our website before long.\\nThe every other day schedule of caffeine intake to me seems like the most rational one if one wants to maximize on the performance enhancing effects of caffeine without suffering the effects of caffeine withdrawal that are associated with being a regular consumer of caffeine and then stopping caffeine intake such as headache and irritability and so forth.\\nNot I nor anyone in my life wants me to experience those effects.\\nAnd I'm sure you don't want to experience those effects for you either.\\nSo if you're somebody that decides to try the every other day protocol or you are somebody who's already doing that protocol, please let me know what your experiences with that are.\\nAt least by my read of the literature on caffeine and its performance enhancing effects, but also the effects of caffeine on neurotransmitter and hormone systems, the every other day caffeine schedule does seem to be the most rational and scientifically grounded one in order to maximize on all those effects.\\nIn addition to so-called performance enhancing effects of caffeine, there are also the well-studied and now fairly well mechanistically understood pro-health effects of caffeine.\\nNow here, when I talk about pro-health effects of caffeine, I want to be very clear that if your schedule of caffeine intake, that is your timing of caffeine intake or anything else for that matter, offsets getting regular high quality sleep of sufficient duration, well, then you are undermining the pro-health effects of that thing.\\nThis is true for exercise, this is true for caffeine, this is true for supplementation, this is true for prescription drugs.\\nAgain, you don't want to be neurotically attached to the idea that you have to get perfect sleep every night because that's simply not true, but is absolutely the case that anything, whether or not it's good for you or bad for you in the short term that disrupts your sleep because of the timing in which you're doing that thing is going to undermine your immediate and long-term health before long.\\nSo with that said, there are several well-described health promoting effects of caffeine ingestion.\\nAnd once again, when I say caffeine ingestion, I'm referring to that one to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight dosage.\\nThere are really nice studies showing that being a regular consumer of caffeine can help offset some of the probability, some of the probability of developing Parkinson's and maybe Alzheimer's related dementia as well.\\nThese are not terribly controversial data because of the fact that caffeine is known to increase the release of those catecholamines, dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine as well as acetylcholine.\\nAll those neurotransmitter and neuromodulator systems are the ones that are known to be defective in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, although there are other transmitter and hormone systems that are defective as well.\\nThere are beautiful reviews on the neuroprotective effects of caffeine and neurodegenerative diseases.\\nThey're quite extensive.\\nAnd I'll just refer you to one and the references therein.\\nAnd we'll provide a link to this in the show note captions.\\nSo the title, as the topic at hand suggests is the neuroprotective effects of caffeine and neurodegenerative diseases.\\nThis was published in 2016.\\nI'm sure there have been other reviews since then, but it includes many, many quality references and studies both in animals and in humans pointing to the fact that specific enzymes that are associated with the health of in particular dopamine neurons are made more robust by regular ingestion of caffeine.\\nIt also points to the fact that the increase in dopamine receptors that is induced by regular ingestion of caffeine that I referred to earlier is another way in which dopamine, however many dopamine neurons remain around in people with Parkinson's or people who are aging that lose dopamine neurons naturally, that dopamine can have its maximal effect because of the increase in receptors for dopamine that caffeine induces.\\nAnd there are other biological mechanisms that further support why caffeine ought to be neuroprotective, including its effects on the acetylcholine system, which is one of the major systems disrupted in Alzheimer's dementia.\\nSo in other words, it makes perfect sense as to why caffeine would be neuroprotective.\\nCaffeine has also been shown to diminish headache, particularly when taken in combination with aspirin.\\nAnd that's because of the effects of caffeine and aspirin on blood flow.\\nThere's also evidence that caffeine can provide brief but substantial relief from asthma.\\nSo I wouldn't want people to rely on caffeine as a life-saving approach to an asthmatic attack.\\nThat said, for people that suffer from minor asthma, that caffeine intake, again, of the dosages that we talked about before has been shown to alleviate some of the major symptoms of asthma for anywhere from one to four hours.\\nAnd I know this is of relevance to a lot of people out there.\\nBecause caffeine increases the catecholamines and in particular because caffeine increases dopamine transmission in the prefrontal cortex, this area of the brain associated with focus and rule setting and context and task switching.\\nCaffeine is known to improve focus and alertness in particular in people who have symptoms of ADHD or other attention and focus issues.\\nNow, caffeine alone does not appear to be as potent for the treatment of ADHD as are things like Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil and Armodafinil and Vyvanse.\\nIf you would like a sort of head-by-head comparison of prescription drugs, supplements, and things like caffeine, as well as coverage of behavioral tools and nutritional tools, et cetera, that can positively offset some of the symptoms of ADHD, please see the episode that I did on ADHD.\\nAgain, that's available at hubermanlab.com in all formats.\\nBut that said, caffeine does increase focus and it does it through a number of different mechanisms, not the least of which is to increase dopamine transmission in the forebrain, just as a drug like Ritalin or Adderall would, although not to the same extent as a drug like Ritalin or Adderall does.\\nBefore we close today, I do want to just briefly return to the reinforcing effects of caffeine that we talked about earlier.\\nThis study on the honeybees that showed that bees prefer certain nectars because they contain caffeine, even though they are not aware that those nectars contain caffeine.\\nThey just come to like the feeling that those nectars provide them so much that they associate that in a subconscious way with the flowers themselves, and they come to like those flowers.\\nOr human beings, for instance, children that ingest caffeinated beverages come to adore the taste of those beverages.\\nAnd beautiful studies have been done that describe how children and adults truly cannot distinguish between the taste of a caffeinated and non-caffeinated beverage, and caffeine can be placed into essentially any beverage in order to give us a preference for that beverage or food.\\nIn fact, the studies have been done with yogurt.\\nIf you put caffeine into yogurt of different flavors, even plain yogurt, which most kids don't like, they will come to prefer whatever flavor contain the caffeine, even if then you remove the caffeine from that flavor.\\nNow, eventually their preference for that flavor will be extinguished, but all of this is just to say that so many of the things that we like, whether or not it's coffee or tea or a given flavor of food or a given experience or even exercise occur because we ingest caffeine in conjunction with those activities.\\nNow, these are not tricks that your nervous system plays on you.\\nThese are real neurochemical reinforcing effects.\\nAnd I think that we would all do well to think about and to leverage these reinforcing effects much in the same way we would do well to think about and hopefully not leverage aversive effects of certain compounds, right? The simple way to put this is I or anyone could get you to dislike something, someone or someplace by making you feel slightly less good, lower mood.\\nI don't even have to make you feel nauseous, but less good after ingesting something or having a certain kind of interaction or being in a certain environment.\\nVery straightforward to do that because of the way that your nervous system is wired for conditioning.\\nHowever, there's the positive side of all this, which is that it's very straightforward to reinforce the experience of a given food, including its taste, but all the context around it, the container, the texture, the people you consume it with, where you consume it, et cetera.\\nFor instance, I wonder why we are not pairing caffeine with broccoli and that here I'm not suggesting that people actually do that experiment or play that trick on people, but you have to sort of imagine that if caffeine is this incredible reinforcer of all sorts of things, in particular, things that we ingest and would want to ingest more of if it's paired with caffeine, well, then you actually can use caffeine as a tool to increase reinforcement of different things and you can avoid caffeine as a way to further reinforce things that you would like to stop.\\nAnd here I'd like to just give the example of sugar cravings.\\nA lot of people ask me, how do I avoid sugar cravings? I've talked about the use of L-glutamine for that.\\nI've talked about making sure you're getting enough essential fatty acids and essential amino acids as a way to reduce sugar cravings.\\nPlease note, however, that if you are somebody who likes to have your sugar, whether or not it's a piece of chocolate or your dessert, et cetera, I'm not saying that's bad, but if you're trying to reduce your sugar cravings, ask yourself, are you ingesting sugar along with caffeine? Could be the caffeine contained in that sugar containing food like chocolate, or it could be that you're having a cup of coffee along with your pastry and then you're struggling with sugar cravings.\\nWell, think about it.\\nYou're not just being reinforced by the sugar and the effects of sugar on dopamine, which are real and both conscious and subconscious through the gut to the brain dopamine system and direct on the brain dopamine system.\\nBut by co-ingesting caffeine, you are also further enhancing the reinforcing effects of sugar.\\nThe flip side to all of this is that you could use caffeine as a way to increase your appetite for certain things.\\nI actually know somebody, I won't reveal who this person is, but they are quite prominent podcaster who ingests 125 to 150 milligrams of caffeine in tablet form, in tablet form, along with herbal tea and use this as a way to develop a preference for herbal tea because they found that coffee was giving them other effects that weren't good for them.\\nSo it works quite well in animals and it works quite well in insects and it works quite well in humans.\\nI suppose animals, insects and humans are all animals at the end of the day.\\nSo no surprise there, but it all underscores the extent to which caffeine is an absolutely fascinating molecule.\\nI mean, it's an ability to offset the sleepiness system, if you will, this adenosine system and to control our schedules in that way, to essentially take a withdrawal against the bank that is adenosine and then pay that back later in the form of getting sleepy later as opposed to when we want to be alert.\\nIts ability to enhance focus, alertness and mood and if taken after trying to learn something and remember it to enhance memory, especially, and its ability to increase VO2 max, increase strength.\\nWe didn't even talk today about it, but I'll just briefly mention that caffeine ingested in the sorts of doses we talked about earlier because its effects on the neuromuscular system and the calcium system associated with neuromuscular exertion and fatigue can increase peak power output and muscle contractibility.\\nIt's enhancing performance there as well.\\nAnd of course, caffeine does a number of other things just generally related to our overall and basal level of mood and alertness, not the least of which are these increases in dopamine.\\nSo caffeine is really an incredible molecule.\\nIt's affecting all these various neurotransmitter systems, but not haphazardly.\\nIt's increasing dopamine and acetylcholine in the forebrain to increase attention.\\nIt's reducing fatigue.\\nIt's improving mental and physical performance for some obvious and some not so obvious reasons and what I think is among the more miraculous and powerful effects of caffeine, it is a potent, potent, potent reinforcer of things, foods, people, and experiences.\\nAnd it's one that you can leverage in any direction that you like once you understand the way that caffeine exerts those reinforcing properties.\\nSo today I've really tried to cover as much as I could about the mechanisms of caffeine action in the brain and body, as well as tools and schedules and dosages in which you can leverage caffeine in order to meet your physical performance, mental performance, and frankly, mental health and overall health goals.\\nIf you're learning from and are

       " Document(page_content='Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.\\nI\\'m Andrew Huberman, and I\\'m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.\\nToday, we are discussing aggression.\\nI\\'m going to explain to you that there are several different types of aggression.\\nFor instance, reactive aggression versus proactive aggression, meaning sometimes people will be aggressive because they feel threatened or they are protecting those that they love who also feel threatened.\\nThere\\'s also proactive aggression where people go out of their way to deliberately try and harm others.\\nAnd there is indirect aggression, which is aggression not involving physical violence.\\nFor instance, shaming people and things of that sort.\\nIt turns out that there are different biological mechanisms underlying each of the different types of aggression.\\nAnd today, I will define those for you.\\nI\\'ll talk about the neural circuits in the brain and body that mediate each of the different kinds of aggression, talk about some of the hormones and peptides and neurotransmitters involved.\\nI promise to make it all accessible to you, even if you do not have any biology or science background.\\nI will also discuss tools, psychological tools and biological tools that one can use to better control aggression.\\nNow, right here at the outset, I want to acknowledge that any discussion about aggression has to have an element of context within it.\\nTo be fair, human beings invest a lot of money, a lot of time and a lot of energy, and indeed can even derive pleasure from aggression.\\nLater, I\\'ll talk about neural circuits in the brain and body that reinforce, in other words, reward through the release of chemicals that make people feel good, acts of aggression.\\nHowever, what I\\'m mainly referring to is the context in which human beings will pay money in order to derive what we call vicarious aggression.\\nPut it simply, people spend an enormous amount of money and time and energy watching other people engage in, for instance, aggressive sports.\\nAnd we know that observing your team winning over another team causes the release of neurochemicals in your brain and body that make you feel good, and yes, that can make you feel more aggressive.\\nWe also know, of course, that most governments invest many billions, if not trillions of dollars, in infrastructure technologies and human beings in order to engage in aggression if needed, so-called military warfare, et cetera.\\nSo today\\'s discussion will include a description of aggression in the pathological sense.\\nWe\\'ll actually talk about an explosive aggressive disorder that most of you probably haven\\'t heard of, but is actually far more common than perhaps you know.\\nWe\\'ll talk about the role of things like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and how that can relate to aggression through the relationship between impulsivity and aggression.\\nAnd we\\'ll talk about verbal aggression, physical aggression, proactive aggression, as mentioned before, and reactive aggression.\\nI\\'m certain that by the end of the episode, you will come away with a much more thorough understanding of what this thing that we call aggression really is.\\nAnd when you see it in other people, I think it will make more sense to you.\\nAnd when you observe it in yourself or the impulse to engage in aggression, verbal or physical or otherwise, I hope that you\\'ll understand it better as well.\\nAnd of course, the tools that I will describe should allow you to modulate and control aggressive tendencies or predispositions to aggressiveness and just generally to be able to engage with people in a more adaptive way overall.\\nBefore we begin, I\\'d like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.\\nIt is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public.\\nIn keeping with that theme, I\\'d like to thank the sponsors of today\\'s podcast.\\nOur first sponsor is Athletic Greens.\\nAthletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink that\\'s designed to meet all your foundational health needs.\\nI started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012.\\nSo I\\'m delighted that they\\'re sponsoring this podcast.\\nThe reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or twice a day is that it covers all of my basic vitamin, mineral and probiotic needs.\\nThe probiotics are especially important to me.\\nThere are now abundant data showing that the gut microbiome, which is basically a community of trillions of little bacteria that live in our guts are beneficial for our immune system, for brain function, for mood and many other aspects of our health.\\nThe gut microbiome thrives on probiotics and Athletic Greens contains the proper array of probiotics to optimize the gut microbiome.\\nAthletic Greens also has adaptogens for recovery from physical and mental exertion, digestive enzymes for gut health, vitamin C, zinc, as I mentioned before, all the other vitamins and minerals that you need in order to cover your basic needs each day.\\nIf you\\'d like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman and claim a special offer.\\nThey\\'ll give you five free travel packs that make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you\\'re on the road and a year supply of vitamin D3K2.\\nThere\\'s now a wealth of data showing that vitamin D3 is important for many aspects of our immediate and long-term health.\\nMany people, even if they get out in the sunlight, are not getting enough vitamin D3 and the K2 is thought to be beneficial for calcium regulation and a number of other things important to our health.\\nSo again, if you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman, you can claim the special offer of the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.\\nToday\\'s episode is also brought to us by Roca.\\nRoca makes sunglasses and eyeglasses that are of the absolute highest quality.\\nThe company was founded by two all-American swimmers from Stanford and everything about their eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.\\nI\\'ve spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system.\\nI can tell you that your visual system has to contend with some pretty tough challenges as you move throughout the day.\\nFor instance, if you go from a brightly lit region to a dimmer region, your visual system has to adjust.\\nRoca eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with those sorts of adjustments in mind.\\nSo for instance, if you\\'re outside in the shade, you move into the sun and then back into the shade, you don\\'t have to take your sunglasses on and off.\\nTheir glasses were initially designed for sports performance.\\nAnd the great thing is they can be used for that, but also they have a terrific aesthetic so you can wear them to work or out to dinner.\\nI wear readers at night and when I drive at night and I wear sunglasses if I\\'m out a lot on really bright days.\\nThe terrific thing about Roca glasses is that even if you get sweaty, they won\\'t fall off.\\nSo you can run with them, you can cycle with them, or as I mentioned before, you can just wear them out and about.\\nIf you\\'d like to try Roca, you can go to roca.com, that\\'s R-O-K-A.com and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order.\\nAgain, that\\'s roca, R-O-K-A.com and enter the code Huberman at checkout.\\nToday\\'s episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.\\nHelix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that in my opinion are the very best you\\'ll find.\\nI started sleeping on a Helix mattress a little over a year ago and it\\'s the best sleep I\\'ve had ever since.\\nIf you go to the Helix site, they have a terrific sleep quiz that just takes a few minutes, asks you questions like, do you tend to sleep on your side, your back or your stomach? Maybe you don\\'t know because you\\'re asleep, but many people do know.\\nAnd even if you don\\'t know, that\\'s okay.\\nIt will also ask you questions like, do you tend to run hot or cold? Do you tend to wake up in the middle of the night or not? And by taking that brief quiz, they will match you to the specific mattress that\\'s ideal for you and your sleep needs.\\nAnd that\\'s really what sets Helix Sleep mattresses apart.\\nEverybody\\'s unique and they know that.\\nSo if you take this quiz, you\\'ll get matched to a particular mattress.\\nFor me, it was the Dusk mattress, D-U-S-K, but again, that\\'s just me and you may match to that one or you may match to a different one.\\nIf you\\'re interested in upgrading your mattress and sleeping much better, go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman.\\nTake that two minute sleep quiz and they\\'ll match you to a customized mattress and you\\'ll get up to $200 off any mattress order and two free pillows.\\nI also love their pillows.\\nI\\'ve always had this issue with pillows that they heat up too much.\\nI\\'m always looking for the pillow that can cool itself.\\nSomehow the pillows stay nice and cool.\\nThey\\'re also not too big, so they\\'re not propped up, not getting the text neck in the middle of the night, but I shouldn\\'t push my chest, nor am I falling back and having trouble breathing in the middle of the night.\\nThey\\'re designed just right.\\nThey also have a 10 years warranty and you get to try it out for 100 nights risk-free.\\nThey\\'ll even pick it up for you if you don\\'t love it, but I think that you will.\\nAgain, if you\\'re interested, you can go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman for up to $200 off and two free pillows.\\nLet\\'s talk about aggression.\\nI think that many people out there are put off by aggression, although others are drawn to aggression, both in themselves and when observing it in others.\\nThe reason to talk about aggression is that, as mentioned before, the context of aggression really matters.\\nSo there are instances where aggression is adaptive.\\nFor instance, a mother protecting her children if she\\'s being attacked or if her children are being threatened.\\nI think most people would agree that so-called maternal aggression of that sort, provided the context is right, is a great thing.\\nProtecting our young is, after all, one of the primary adaptive drives of our species, and thank goodness it is.\\nOf course, other forms of aggression, like unprovoked proactive aggression, somebody simply being violent to somebody else, even when unprovoked.\\nMost of us cringe when we see that kind of behavior.\\nIt can even evoke aggression in people when they observe that kind of behavior.\\nSo again, context really matters, but a more general and perhaps an even more important reason to think about and understand aggression is that by understanding the biology and psychology of aggression, you will be in a much better position to understand how all emotional states come to be, both in yourself and in others.\\nFor instance, many of you have probably heard the statement that I believe arises from pop psychology, not from formal academic psychology, that aggression is just sadness.\\nIt\\'s a form of sadness that\\'s amplified, and it shows up as aggression.\\nBut when we look at the underlying biology and the peer-reviewed literature on this, nothing could be further from the truth.\\nWe have distinct circuits in the brain for aggression versus grief and mourning.\\nThose are non-overlapping.\\nNow, that doesn\\'t mean that you can\\'t be sad and aggressive or in a state of mourning and aggressive at the same time, but the idea that sadness and aggression are one in the same thing is simply not true.\\nAnd by understanding that, or perhaps by understanding that irritability and aggression are not the same thing, you\\'ll be in a much better position to apply some of the tools that we will talk about in this episode in order to be able to reduce or eliminate, or if it\\'s adaptive to you, to modulate aggression.\\nAnd yes, there are cases where modulating your aggression, in some cases, even amplifying aggression, can be adaptive.\\nNow, this, of course, is not the first discussion about the biology of aggression or the psychology of aggression.\\nAnd we really can look to the beginning of the last century as the time in which the formal study of aggression really began.\\nOne of the names that\\'s most associated with the formal study of aggression is none other than Conrad Lorenz.\\nSome of you may be familiar with that name.\\nOthers of you may not be familiar with that name.\\nConrad Lorenz studied so-called imprinting behaviors and fixed action pattern behaviors.\\nHe\\'s most famous, at least in scientific circles, for getting geese to believe that he was their parent.\\nAnd if you were to put into Google Conrad with a K, Lorenz, just as it sounds, Conrad Lorenz, geese, you\\'re going to see a lot of photos of Conrad walking down roads with a lot of geese following him, or swimming in lakes with a lot of geese following him.\\nHe had a habit of geese adopting him because of the behaviors that he partook in.\\nSo he would swim out on a lake in front of a bunch of little geese, and then they would think that he was the parent, and they would imprint on him.\\nHe even lived with these animals, and they lived with him.\\nThat\\'s a strange character from what I hear.\\nBut nonetheless, all this work was deserving of a Nobel Prize because what he discovered were fixed action patterns.\\nThat is, patterns of behavior that could be evoked by a single stimulus.\\nThis is really important.\\nThe idea that you can get a whole category of behaviors, like swimming behind a parent, or looking to somebody for comfort and only them.\\nThe idea that you could get a huge category of different behaviors in a bunch of different contexts triggered by just the presence of that person is remarkable because what it suggested, and what turns out to be true, is that there are neural circuits, not just individual brain areas, but collections of brain areas that work together to engage a pattern of behaviors.\\nAnd that\\'s the first fundamental principle that we need to define today.\\nThat when we talk about aggression, we\\'re talking about activation of neural circuits, not individual brain areas, but neural circuits that get played out in sequence, like keys on a piano.\\nBut that playing out in sequence means that aggression is a verb.\\nIt has a beginning, a middle, and an end.\\nAnd it\\'s a process, it\\'s not an event.\\nAnd as you\\'ll see, that turns out to be very important in terms of thinking about how one can halt aggression, prevent it from happening before it\\'s initiated, or maybe even prolonging aggression, if that\\'s what\\'s needed.\\nNow, Conrad Lorenz had no real knowledge of neural circuits.\\nI mean, obviously he knew there was this thing that we call a brain and a nervous system.\\nAnd he knew that there were chemicals in the brain and hormones and things of that sort that were likely to play a role.\\nBut he really didn\\'t take any measures to define what the neural circuits were.\\nFrankly, he didn\\'t need to.\\nHe had his Nobel Prize and he did all this beautiful work.\\nHe\\'s known for an abundance of work.\\nBut he did think about what sorts of underlying processes could drive something like aggression.\\nAnd he talked about one particular feature that\\'s especially important.\\nAnd that\\'s this notion of a pressure.\\nThe idea that, yes, certain hormones will bias somebody or an animal to be aggressive.\\nCertain neurotransmitter states, and you\\'ll learn what those are today, will bias somebody to be more or less aggressive, maybe even submissive and passive, maybe outright proactively aggressive towards anyone or anything in front of them.\\nAnd yes, of course, there will be historical features based on their childhood, et cetera, et cetera.\\nHe understood that there will be a constellation of things that would drive people to be aggressive.\\nAnd he described a so-called pressure, almost like a hydraulic pressure.\\nJust think about fluid pressure in a small container being pushed, pushed, pushed until the can or the container is ready to explode.\\nAnd how multiple features, multiple variables could impinge on that and create that pressure.\\nIt turns out that\\'s exactly the way the system works.\\nThere is no single brain area that flips the switch for aggression.\\nAlthough we\\'ll soon talk about a brain structure that generally houses the propensity and the output of aggression.\\nThis notion of a hydraulic pressure that can drive us toward aggressive behavior, or conversely can be very low pressure and keep us in a state of non-reactivity, maybe even passivity or submissiveness, is a very important feature because it really captures the essence of how neural circuits work when we\\'re talking about primitive behaviors generally.\\nAnd you can start to notice this in yourself and in others.\\nYou can start to notice when you are veering toward aggression, or when someone is veering toward aggression, verbal or physical.\\nNow that veering is the buildup of this hydraulic pressure that Lorenz was referring to.\\nAnd it really does have an underlying biological basis.\\nNow it was some years later that the first experiments came along, which really started to identify the brain areas and the biological so-called pressures that can induce aggressive behavior.\\nAnd the person that really gets credit for this is a guy by the name of Walter Hess, who at that time was working on cats.\\nAnd I know that when you say working on cats, a lot of people will cringe.\\nA lot of people have cats as pets, and certainly cats can be delightful.\\nSome people like them more, some people like them less.\\nMost people cringe at the idea of doing experiments on cats.\\nI should say that these days, very few laboratories work on cats.\\nMost laboratories that work on animal models will work on flies, Drosophila fruit flies for their capacity to do genetics on laboratory mice, sometimes rats, but usually mice.\\nAnd occasionally you\\'ll find a lab that still works on cats.\\nBack in the time of Hess, very few laboratories worked on mice.\\nMost laboratories worked on cats or rats.\\nAnd the reason for that is nowadays, most laboratories use mice if they use animal models because of the genetic tools that exist in mice to knock out this gene or knock in this gene, et cetera, which can\\'t be done in humans or non-human primates, at least not very easily at this point in history.\\nSo when I say he was working on cats, I realize that probably evokes some negative emotions in some of you, maybe even aggression in some of you.\\nWhat we can do, however, is look at the data and make use of the data in terms of our understanding.\\nWhat Hess did was he had cats that were awake and he was able to lower stimulating electrode into their brain.\\nNow, keep in mind that the brain does not have any pain sensors.\\nSo after a small hole is made in the skull, electrodes are lowered into the brain.\\nThis is what\\'s done commonly in human neurosurgery.\\nAnd he was able to stimulate different brain areas.\\nAnd he was sort of poking around.\\nAnd when I say sort of, he was doing this with some logical intent and purpose.\\nHe wasn\\'t just poking around in there for fun.\\nHe was trying to identify brain regions that could generate entire categories of behavior, a la Lorenz, right? These fixed action pattern behaviors.\\nEventually his electrode landed in a site and he provided electrical stimulation to the cat that caused this otherwise passive purring, relaxing cat to suddenly go into an absolute rage.\\nSo arched back, hissing, hair up, so-called pilar erection, where the hairs go up.\\nAnimals try and make themselves as big as possible, often when they\\'re aggressive.\\nDrooling, maybe even spitting, believe it or not, cats and other animals can do this.\\nAnd the cat tried to attack him or anyone else and anything else, even inanimate objects, when he stimulated this particular brain area.\\nSo Hess obviously took notice of this incredible transformation in behavior.\\nAnd the fact that when he turned off the stimulation of this particular brain area, the cat very quickly, within seconds, went back to being passive, calm kitty.\\nNow, of course, he repeated this experiment in other animals because he had to confirm that it wasn\\'t just happenstance, that there wasn\\'t something unique about this one cat that perhaps he had stimulated an area that had been built up during the kittenhood of this cat and had been reactivated.\\nMaybe this kitten had been traumatized early in life or scared and reactivation of a particular circuit, unique to that cat, created this aggressive behavior.\\nThat wasn\\'t the case.\\nEvery cat that he looked at and stimulated this particular brain area, the cat would immediately go into an aggressive, almost rage-type behavior.\\nNow, of course, we can\\'t anthropomorphize.\\nWe don\\'t know what the cat was feeling.\\nFor all we know, the cat could be happy, although that seems pretty unlikely.\\nAnd later experiments done in mice, but also in humans, confirm that indeed, stimulation of this brain area evoked not just behavioral aggression, but also subjective feelings of aggression and anger.\\nSo what was this incredible brain area? Or rather, I should say, what is the brain area that harbored this incredible capacity to generate aggressive behavior in Hess\\'s experiments? Well, for those of you that are regular listeners of this podcast, you\\'ll probably be relieved to know that today we\\'re going to talk about some new neural circuits.\\nOftentimes we\\'ll center back on the amygdala or the prefrontal cortex, and those names will come up.\\nAnd for those of you that haven\\'t heard them before, don\\'t worry, I\\'ll make it clear as to what those brain areas are and what they do.\\nBut today we\\'re going to talk a lot about the so-called VMH or ventromedial hypothalamus.\\nThe ventromedial hypothalamus is a nucleus, meaning a small collection of neurons.\\nWhat are neurons? Nerve cells.\\nAnd that small collection of neurons that we call the ventromedial hypothalamus is truly small.\\nIt\\'s only about 1,500 neurons on one side of your brain and a matching 1,500 neurons on the other side of your brain, and that combined 3,000 neurons or so, it\\'s not exactly 3,000, but 3,000 neurons or so is sufficient to generate aggressive behavior of the sort that Hess observed in the cat.\\nAnd believe it or not, when you see somebody who\\'s in an act of rage or in an act of verbal aggression or in an act of defensive aggression, protecting their family or loved ones or country, et cetera, almost certainly those neurons are engaged in that behavior.\\nThose neurons are perhaps even generating that behavior.\\nAnd next I\\'ll describe some experiments that were done just recently within the last 10 years or so, but leading right up until this year and even last month that keep confirming again and again and again, that it is the activity of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus that are both necessary and sufficient to generate the full catalog of aggressive behaviors.\\nNow, before I go further to describe the beautiful recent studies on the VMH, the ventromedial hypothalamus and the important role of testosterone and more importantly, estrogen in the activation of aggressive behavior.\\nThat\\'s right, that\\'s soon to be clear to you why that\\'s the case.\\nI want to emphasize that the ventromedial hypothalamus is something that we should all care about, why? Well, it turns out that many categories of psychiatric disorders, developmental disorders and psychological challenges, things like schizophrenia, PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, borderline personality disorder and even certain forms of autism can include elements of aggression and even violence.\\nNow, it\\'s certainly not the case that aggression and violence are present in all people who suffer from schizophrenia or PTSD or depression or autism or borderline personality disorder.\\nI\\'m absolutely not saying that.\\nHowever, it can be a feature of those and it\\'s a well-described feature in terms of trying to understand the constellation of challenges that people suffer from when they have those.\\nSo thinking about the VMH goes way beyond just understanding basic aggression in the context of adaptive aggression.\\nSo when earlier I use the example maternal aggression, that\\'s one adaptive form of aggression.\\nIt also can be pathologic aggression, meaning it can harm ourselves or others.\\nSo keep this in mind as we go forward because later we\\'re going to talk about specific tools designed to modulate or prevent aggression in, for instance, people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and especially kids with ADHD.\\nIn the meantime, let\\'s return to the VMH, this relatively small collection of neurons.\\nAnd the reason I say relatively small is, well, your brain has many hundreds of billions of neurons, maybe even trillions of neurons.\\nThe exact number of neurons isn\\'t really clear, but it\\'s a lot.\\nAnd it certainly is a lot relative to the number of neurons of this 3000 or so neurons living in your hypothalamus that can evoke this aggressive response.\\nExperiments done by David Anderson\\'s lab at Caltech were really the first to parse the fine circuitry and to really show that the ventromedial hypothalamus is both necessary and sufficient for aggressive behavior.\\nThese are important experiments and they\\'re worth knowing about.\\nWhat they did was they identified, first of all, where the ventromedial hypothalamus was in the mouse.\\nThat was pretty straightforward to do, it was sort of known before they started these experiments.\\nAnd then they analyzed which genes, meaning which DNA, which of course becomes RNA and RNA becomes protein, which DNA and therefore which proteins are expressed in particular cells of the ventromedial hypothalamus.\\nAnd it turns out that there\\'s a particular category of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus that make an estrogen receptor.\\nAnd it is those neurons in particular that are responsible for generating aggressive behavior.\\nHow did they know this? Well, they used a tool that\\'s actually been described by a previous guest of this podcast.\\nWe had an episode with the psychiatrist and bioengineer and my colleague at Stanford School of Medicine, Carl Diceroth.\\nHe and others have developed tools that allow people to control the activity of neurons, essentially by remote control, by shining light on those neurons.\\nSo in the context of an experiment on a mouse, which is what David\\'s lab did, and these were the beautiful experiments of Dayu Lin, who\\'s now in her own laboratory at New York University, put a little fiber optic cable down into the brain of the, into the hypothalamus that is of the mouse.\\nThe mouse is able to move around in its cage, freely moving, even though it has a little tether, this little wire, it\\'s a very thin wire.\\nAnd that little thin wire is actually a little what we call optrode.\\nAnd the experimentalist, in this case, Dayu, was able to stimulate the turning on of a little bit of blue light.\\nAnd that blue light activated only those estrogen receptor neurons in only the ventromedial hypothalamus.\\nAnd the way she was able to do that is she had introduced a gene that had been developed by our friend, Carl Diceroth, that allows light to trigger electrical activity in those neurons.\\nSo if any of that is confusing, or if all of that is confusing, here\\'s the experiment.\\nThere\\'s a mouse in a cage, has a little wire coming out of its head.\\nIt doesn\\'t notice, believe it or not, we know this because it\\'s still eating and mating and doing all the things that mice like to do on a daily basis and sleeping, et cetera.\\nAnd the mere pressing of a button will activate a little bit of light released at the end of that wire.\\nThat light activates particular neurons.\\nIn this case, it\\'s the estrogen receptor containing neurons in only the ventromedial hypothalamus.\\nWhen that mouse is in a cage with another mouse, a couple of things happen, depending on what the other mouse is, or we could say who the other mouse is.\\nIf it\\'s a male mouse and you put in there with a female mouse, the male mouse will attempt to mate with a female mouse.\\nProvided that the male mouse has gone through puberty, he will try to mount and mate with a female mouse.\\nNow, female mice are either in a receptive phase or a non-receptive phase of their so-called estrous cycle.\\nThey don\\'t have a menstrual 28-day cycle, they have an estrous cycle.\\nAnd on particular days of that estrous cycle, they are not happy to mate.\\nThey will basically keep their hindquarters away from the male mouse at all costs.\\nThey\\'ll even attack the male mouse.\\nOn certain days of the estrous cycle, however, the female mouse will undergo what\\'s called lordosis, which is an arching of her back, and she\\'ll allow the male to mount and mate with her.\\nSo a large number of experiments were done, but the first experiment really was to put the male mouse in with a female mouse who\\'s in the so-called receptive phase of estrous.\\nThat is, she will allow mating.\\nAnd he starts mating with her.\\nAnd they go through the standard repertoire of mating behaviors that you observe in mice, mounting, thrusting, intromission as it\\'s called in the mouse sex world.\\nWell, I guess I don\\'t know what the mice call it, but that\\'s what the experimenters call it.\\nAnd then afterwards that he will dismount, okay? So they observe this kind of mounting and sex behavior.\\nThis is very typical, but about halfway through the behavior, Dayou turned on the light to stimulate these estrogen receptor containing neurons only in the male mouse.\\nAnd what she observed was incredibly dramatic.\\nThe male mouse ceases from trying to mate with the female mouse and immediately tries to kill the female mouse.\\nHe starts attacking her.\\nThen she turns off the light, the male stops and goes back to trying to mate with the female mouse.\\nI\\'m sure all of this was very confusing and disturbing to the female mouse.\\nNonetheless, that was the repertoire.\\nThey would mate, she would stimulate these ventromedial hypothalamus neurons.\\nThe male mouse would immediately try and attack and kill the female mouse.\\nAnd then she would stop the stimulation and he would stop trying to attack and kill the female mouse return to the attempt at least to mate with the female mouse.\\nThese are such dramatic shifts in behavior triggered only by the activation of only this small set of neurons within the ventromedial hypothalamus.\\nAnd for those of you that think that you can watch this sort of thing without being disturbed, I encourage you to go to YouTube.\\nWe will provide a link where you can see a video of this type of behavior.\\nIt\\'s incredibly dramatic.\\nThe shift in behavior is almost instantaneous, occurs within seconds, if not milliseconds, thousands of a second.\\nThe next experiment that she did was to put a male mouse with this stimulation with light capability in its ventromedial hypothalamus into a cage alone, but with a rubber glove filled with air or water.\\nMouse is walking around, sniffing, peeing, which is what male mice seem to do.\\nThey seem to urinate everywhere.\\nEspecially an interesting, perhaps interesting feature of male mice and actually many male animals, perhaps even humans, we don\\'t know, or maybe we do know.\\nBasically, this has been observed time and time again in experiments, mainly by Lisa Stowers\\' lab at the Scripps Institute has characterized this.\\nIf you put female mice into an arena or a cage, they always urinate in a very small corner of that cage.\\nWhereas if you put male mice into an arena or a cage, they urinate everywhere.\\nThey have this kind of obsession with spraying their urine everywhere.\\nYou can sort of transpose that to human behavior if you like.\\nIn any event, Dayu put the mouse in the cage alone, but with this rubber glove, the mouse is walking around, urinating, et cetera, doing whatever it is that mice do.\\nThen she stimulates the activation of these ventromedial hypothalamus neurons, and the mouse immediately tries to kill the glove.\\nIt goes into a rage, attacking the glove, as if it were another mouse or some other animate object.\\nBut of course, it\\'s an inanimate object.\\nIt\\'s just a rubber glove.\\nShe stops the stimulation, and the mouse immediately goes back to being completely calm or at least not attacking.\\nAgain, we don\\'t know what the mouse was feeling.\\nSo these are very traumatic videos.\\nAgain, you can see them by following the link that we\\'ll provide in the caption.\\nIf that sort of thing is going to disturb you to see, for instance, the one mouse attacking another, please just don\\'t watch them.\\nI\\'m not interested in traumatizing anybody or you traumatizing yourself, that is.\\nA number of different variations were done on this experiment.\\nFor instance, stimulating the VMH in female mice, as opposed to male mice, putting the female mice in with other female mice or with other male mice, no matter what variation one carries out.\\nSo it doesn\\'t matter if it\\'s male with female, male with male, female with female, et cetera.\\nStimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus in a male mouse or a female mouse evokes this very dramatic, almost instantaneous aggressive behavior, physically aggressive behavior.\\nSubsequent experiments done by Dai-Yu Lin in her own laboratory and other laboratories have shown that the ventromedial hypothalamus is connected with a bunch of other brain areas that are interesting, and I\\'ll talk about some of those in a little bit.\\nBut one of them that I want to call out now is the so-called PAG, the periaqueductal gray nucleus.\\nThis is a large structure in the back of the brain that houses things like neurons that can create opioids.\\nWe all know of the opioid crisis, but these are neurons that can produce endogenous, means made by the body, chemicals that can cause pain relief.\\nYou could understand why that might occur in a circuit for aggression, right? Even if one is the aggressor, it\\'s likely that they may incur some physical damage and they\\'d want some pain relief.\\nThe PAG also is connected to a number of neural circuits that eventually, through several processing stations, excuse me, arrive at things like the jaws.\\nAnd in fact, stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus can evoke biting and aggressive biting behavior.\\nNow, aggressive biting behavior is particularly interesting because in humans, and especially in human children, biting is something that, while young children might do as a form of aggression, tends to disappear pretty early in childhood.\\nAnd if it doesn\\'t, it\\'s often seen as a mark of pathology.\\nI have a story about this, actually.\\nWhen I was a kid, I went to a summer sports camp.\\nAnd I\\'ll never forget this.\\nWe were playing soccer, and in a rare stroke of luck or accident, I happened to score a goal.\\nI wasn\\'t a particularly good soccer player, especially not at that stage of my life.\\nThey later figured out that it was just better to make me a fullback, because I could just wait there and do what fullbacks do.\\nI was better at taking the ball or the person out than I was putting the ball in the goal.\\nNonetheless, again, by chance, I scored a goal, and I was trotting back to my side of the field.\\nAnd all of a sudden, I felt this sting in my back.\\nA kid, not to be named, although I do remember your name, I\\'m not going to tell you what his name was, a kid jumped on my back and bit me on the top of my back.\\nAnd this, of course, resulted in a discussion and a timeout and all the usual things, and parents, I think, got involved, I don\\'t recall, and didn\\'t think much else of it.\\nBut I recall that this was considered especially troubling behavior, because he bit me as opposed to hit me or shoved me down or something of that sort.\\nAnd it does seem as if the tendency to use biting as an aggressive behavior is associated with a more primitive circuitry.\\nNow here, I\\'m truly anthropomorphizing.\\nI don\\'t know what this other kid happened to be thinking or feeling at the time.\\nHow could I? And I certainly am not going to say that biting in every case reflects a pathology, although I think there is general agreement in the psychology community and the psychiatric community that past a certain age, the using of one\\'s teeth to impart aggression and damage on others is a particularly primitive and troubling, or at least for the observer or the person that experiences a pretty disturbing event.\\nDayu\\'s lab has shown that activation of the ventromedial hypothalamus triggers a downstream circuit in the periaqueductal gray, which then triggers a whole other set of circuits of fixed action patterns.\\nHere we are back to Lorenz again with fixed action patterns, including swinging of the limbs, punching.\\nThis wouldn\\'t necessarily be controlled punching, but also biting behavior.\\nSo it\\'s remarkable to me at least that we have circuits in our brain that can evoke violent use of things like our mouth or violent use of things like our limbs that of course could be used for things like singing or kissing or eating or, you know, gesticulating in any kind of polite or impolite way.\\nThe point here is that neural circuits, not individual brain areas evoke the constellation of behaviors that we call aggression.\\nNow, many of you are probably puzzled or at least should be because I\\'ve been talking about this highly specialized brain area, the ventromedial hypothalamus and this highly specialized subcategory of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus, these neurons that make estrogen receptor.\\nAnd yet the activation of those cells triggers dramatic and immediate aggression, both in males and in females and both against males and against females.\\nSo what\\'s going on here? Most of us think about estrogen and we don\\'t immediately think of aggression.\\nMost of us hear testosterone and we might think about aggression, although other things as well.\\nIn order to understand this, I just want to briefly refer back to a conversation that I had on a previous episode of the Huberman Lab podcast and that was with my colleague, the great Robert Sapolsky, of course, is a professor at Stanford who studied testosterone and its impacts on behavior as well as estrogen and other hormones and their impacts on behavior.\\nTo make a long story short and to dispel a still unfortunately very common myth, testosterone does not increase aggressiveness.\\nTestosterone increases proactivity and the willingness to lean into effort in competitive scenarios.\\nSometimes this is referred to as the challenge hypothesis, but to make a long story short, if people are given testosterone or if you look at people who have different levels, excuse me, of testosterone endogenously that they naturally make, what you\\'ll find is that testosterone tends to increase competitiveness, but not just in aggressive scenarios.\\nSo if somebody is already aggressive, giving them testosterone will have the tendency to make them more aggressive.\\nIf somebody, however, is very benevolent and altruistic, giving them testosterone will make them more benevolent and altruistic, at least up to a point.\\nNow, of course, there are certain forms of synthetic testosterone that are known in sports circles and in other circles to increase aggressiveness because of the way those particular forms of synthetic testosterone work.\\nBut in general, most of the experiments that I\\'m referring to have not been done using those.\\nThey\\'ve been done using the, let\\'s call them the more traditional biological forms of testosterone or that resemble the biological forms of testosterone.\\nIn fact, Robert Sapolsky described a really interesting experiment in which if you look at testosterone levels or you administer additional testosterone to people who are doing philanthropy, giving money to organizations, and so they\\'re essentially doing good because these are organizations doing good, what you find is that increased testosterone or further increasing testosterone makes people more willing to compete to give more money than the other person in the room in order to put it in air quotes to alpha out the other person by giving more money.\\nSo this is an act of altruistic or benevolent philanthropy.\\nIt is not an act of aggression.\\nOf course, we don\\'t know what the people are feeling underneath all that.\\nAgain, we can\\'t anthropomorphize or project onto other people what they\\'re feeling.\\nBut the point is that testosterone itself does not make people more aggressive.\\nAnd in the experiments that we\\'ve been talking about up until now, it\\'s actually the activation of estrogen receptor containing neurons that makes these animals more aggressive.\\nAnd it turns out there\\'s evidence that in certain contexts, estrogen can make people more aggressive.\\nSo what\\'s going on here? Well, what\\'s going on is that testosterone can be converted into estrogen through a process called aromatization.\\nThere\\'s an enzyme called aromatase.\\nAnytime you have word that ends in A-S-E, at least if it\\'s in the context of biology, it\\'s almost always, not always, but almost always an enzyme.\\nSo the aromatase enzyme converts testosterone into estrogen.\\nAnd it is actually testosterone aromatized, converted into estrogen and then binding to these estrogen-containing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus that triggers aggression.\\nI want to repeat that.\\nIt is not testosterone itself that triggers aggression.\\nIt is testosterone aromatized into estrogen within the brain and binding to these estrogen receptor containing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus that evokes aggression and dramatic aggression at that.\\nNow, this effect of estrogen causing aggression in the brain is very robust.\\nSo much so that if you take a mouse that lacks the aromatase enzyme or a human that lacks the aromatase enzyme, and they do exist, then there is a reduction in overall aggression despite high levels of testosterone.\\nAnd if people who, or mice who have the aromatase enzyme have that enzyme blocked, well then it doesn\\'t matter how much you increase testosterone or any of its other derivatives, you do not observe this aggression.\\nSo this runs counter to everything that we know and think about the role of testosterone.\\nAgain, testosterone increases competitiveness.\\nIt can increase the desire to work under challenge.\\nI\\'ve said it before and I ran this or pressure tested this against Robert Sapolsky who\\'s been working on testosterone and its role in the brain and behavior for many decades now.\\nIt is fair to say that testosterone has the net effect of making effort feel good, or at least increasing the threshold at which effort feels bad or unsustainable.\\nAnd it does that by way of changing the activity or the threshold for activation of brain structures like the amygdala and other brain structures associated with anxiety.\\nSo the next time somebody says testosterone makes people aggressive, you can say, ah, no, actually it\\'s estrogen that makes people aggressive and animals aggressive for that matter.\\nNow, of course it is the case that because males have relatively less estrogen circulating in their brain and body than females, right? Because they have testes, not ovaries, that testosterone is required in the first place in order to be converted into estrogen to activate this aggressive circuit involving these estrogen receptor containing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus.\\nBut nonetheless, it is estrogen that is the final step.\\nIt is the hormone on which aggression hinges.\\nAnd I think for most people, that\\'s a quite surprising finding.\\nAnd yet this is perhaps one of the more robust findings in both the animal and human literature as it relates to hormones and psychological states and behavior.\\nNow, of course it is the case that if testosterone is low, that a person or an animal will exhibit less aggressive behavior.\\nBut that\\'s not because of reduced testosterone per se, it\\'s because of the subsequent reduction in testosterone.\\nMeaning if there\\'s no testosterone to aromatize into estrogen, estrogen will also be lower.\\nSo we\\'ve established that it\\'s not testosterone but testosterone converted into estrogen that activates these circuits for aggression.\\nBut nonetheless, it\\'s still surprising, right? I mean, most of us don\\'t think about estrogen as the hormone that stimulates aggression, but it turns out it\\'s all contextual.\\nThere are beautiful data showing that whether or not estrogen stimulates aggression can be powerfully modulated by whether or not days are short or days are long.\\nIn other words, whether or not there\\'s a lot of sunshine or not.\\nNow, obviously brain is encased in skull.\\nSo it doesn\\'t really know if there\\'s a lot of sunshine out there, even though you can see the sun with your eyes, you can feel it on your skin.\\nDay length is converted into hormonal signals and chemical signals.\\nAnd the primary hormonal and chemical signals involve melatonin and dopamine and also the stress hormones.\\nSo to make a very long story short, in the long days where we get a lot of sunlight, both in our eyes and on our skin, melatonin levels are reduced.\\nMelatonin is a hormone that tends to produce states of sleepiness and quiescence.\\nIt also tends to activate pathways that tend to reduce things like breeding and sexual behavior.\\nIn long days, dopamine is increased.\\nDopamine is a molecule associated with feelings of wellbeing and motivation and the desire to seek out all sorts of things, all sorts of motivated behaviors.\\nAnd in long days, provided we\\'re getting enough sunlight on our skin and to our eyes, the stress hormones, especially cortisol and some of the other stress hormones, are reduced in levels.\\nIf estrogen levels are increased experimentally under long day conditions, it does not evoke aggression.\\nHowever, in short days, if estrogen is increased, there\\'s a heightened predisposition for aggression.\\nAnd that makes perfect sense if you think about what short days do to the biology of your brain and body.\\nIn short days, the melatonin signal goes up.\\nThere\\'s more melatonin circulating for more of each 24-hour cycle.\\nStress hormones are circulating more.\\nWhy? Short days tend to be associated with winter.\\nIn winter, we are bombarded with more bacteria and viruses because bacteria and viruses actually survive better in cold than they do in heat.\\nIn fact, in my laboratory, we work with a lot of viruses and bacteria, and when we want to keep them alive, we put them in the freezer.\\nIf we want to kill them, if we want to inoculate them, we put them under UV light, like you would see from the sunlight.\\nSo shorter days are conducive to aggression, not because days are short per se, but because stress hormone levels are higher and because dopamine levels are lower.\\nNow, here\\'s where all of this starts to converge on a very clear biological picture, a very clear psychological picture, and indeed a very clear set of tools that we can think about and use.\\nUnder conditions where cortisol is high, where the stress hormone is elevated, and under conditions where the neuromodulator serotonin is reduced, there is a greater propensity for estrogen to trigger aggression.\\nNow, again, I know I\\'ve said it before, but for males who make a lot of testosterone relative to estrogen, you have to swap in your mind this idea that if testosterone is high, that means that estrogen is low, because while that can be true in the periphery in the body, if testosterone is high, there is going to be some aromatization, that conversion of testosterone to estrogen.\\nSo anytime you hear that testosterone is high, you should think testosterone is high in the body and perhaps estrogen is low in the body, but that means that there\\'s going to be heightened levels of estrogen in the brain and therefore increased propensity for aggression.\\nIn females who generally make less testosterone relative to estrogen, there is sufficient estrogen already present to trigger aggression.\\nSo both males and females are primed for aggression, but that\\'s riding on a context, and that context of whether or not you get a tendency for aggression or not depends on whether or not cortisol is high or low, and I\\'m telling you that if cortisol is relatively higher in any individual, there\\'s going to be a tilt, an increase in that hydraulic pressure that Lorenz talked about toward aggression.\\nAnd if serotonin, the neuromodulator, that is associated with feelings of wellbeing and sometimes even of slight passivity, but certainly of wellbeing, if serotonin is low, there\\'s also going to be a further shift towards an aggressive tendency.\\nSo if we return to Lorenz\\'s hydraulic pressure model of aggression in other internal states, we realize that external stimuli, things that we hear, things that we see, for instance, someone saying something upsetting or us seeing somebody do something that we don\\'t like to others or to us, as well as our internal state, our subjective feelings of wellbeing, but also our stress level, our feelings of whether or not we have enough resources and are content with what we have, all of that is converging on this thing that we call internal state and creating this pressure of either to be more aggressive or less aggressive.\\nAnd now we have some major players feeding into that final pathway, that question of whether or not, will we hit the other person? Will we say the thing that is considered aggressive? Will we not say it? If somebody says something or does something aggressive to us, will we respond or will we be submissive or even passive? Again, there are many things funneling into that question and dictating whether or not the answer is absolutely I\\'ll fight back or I\\'m going to attack them even unprovoked or if they say this, I\\'m going to do that or no matter what they do, I\\'m not going to respond.\\nThese kinds of things are very complex and yet we really can boil them down to just a few common elements.\\nAnd I\\'m telling you that those elements are whether or not cortisol levels are relatively lower or relatively higher.\\nAgain, relatively higher is going to tend to make people more reactive, why? Because reactivity is really a function of the autonomic nervous system, which is sort of like a seesaw that oscillates between the so-called sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system, which tends to put us into a state of readiness through the release of adrenaline.\\nCortisol and adrenaline when they\\'re circulating in the brain and body make us more likely to move and to react and to speak.\\nIt\\'s actually what will induce a kind of low level tremor, which is an anticipatory tremor to be able to move more quickly, right? A body in motion is more easily set into further motion, that is.\\nAnd the neuromodulator serotonin is a neuromodulator that in general is associated with feelings of wellbeing in response to what we already have.\\nSo when we are well-fed, serotonin tends to be released in our brain and body, in particular, well-fed with carbohydrates.\\nThe precursor to serotonin is tryptophan.\\nAnd indeed there are nice studies exploring the types of diets, nutritional programs that can reduce aggressive behavior, both in children and in adults.\\nAnd tryptophan rich diets or supplementation with tryptophan.\\nSo for tryptophan rich diets, things like white turkey meat, but then there are also a number of carbohydrates.\\nYou can look up, it\\'s very easy to find foods that contain lots of tryptophan.\\nThose foods contain the precursor to serotonin.\\nNow it isn\\'t simply the case that eating more foods with tryptophan will tend to reduce your aggression.\\nI suppose it could do that if you ate it in abundance, it could make you tired and then you\\'re less likely to be aggressive.\\nI don\\'t recommend that strategy.\\nBut the idea here is that when it\\'s been explored, increasing levels of tryptophan, either by supplementation or by food or drugs, prescription drugs that increase serotonin.\\nSo for instance, fluoxetine, sometimes called Prozac or Zoloft or any number of the other SSRIs tend to reduce aggressive behavior.\\nNow, not always, but in general, that\\'s the case.\\nSimilarly, because elevated cortisol tends to shift the whole system, again, create more of a hydraulic pressure towards aggressive states.\\nIf cortisol levels are reduced, well then the tendency for aggressive behavior is reduced.\\nThis is supported by a number of peer-reviewed studies.\\nWe\\'ll provide links to some of those in the caption show notes.\\nAnd we\\'re going to return to these a bit later in the context of specific studies that have looked at genetic variants in different individuals that cause them to make more or less serotonin or at least to metabolize serotonin differently.\\nThis is also the case for so-called intermittent explosive disorder that can often be associated with gene variants that control how much serotonin is made or how it\\'s metabolized or how much cortisol is made and how much it\\'s metabolized.\\nIn thinking about tools, there are a number of things that one could consider.\\nFirst of all, there are a number of decent studies exploring how supplementation with the omega-3 fatty acids, which are precursors of some of the transmitter systems, including serotonin that can modulate, not directly mediate, but modulate mood and emotional tone.\\nSupplementation with the omega-3s has been shown to reduce impulsivity and aggressiveness in certain contexts in things like ADHD or in individuals who have a predisposition for aggressive type behavior or aggressive thinking.\\nNow, that doesn\\'t necessarily mean that the omega-3 fatty acids are going directly to the ventromedial hypothalamus and changing the activity of neurons.\\nThey\\'re more likely they are causing or modulating an overall shift in mood through the immune system, through hormone systems that are changing the overall tone or the propensity for neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus to be activated.\\nHow much omega-3 fatty acid, what source? Well, we\\'ve talked about this on the podcast before.\\nYou can, of course, get omega-3 fatty acids from a number of different foods.\\nGetting them from whole foods is probably the best way to do it.\\nBut many people, including people with depression, will often supplement with one gram or more of omega-3 fatty acids per day.\\nSome people, including myself, will take them every day as just a general mood enhancer.\\nI don\\'t suffer from depression, but I\\'ve found it to be beneficial for my health.\\nAnd so some people will do that.\\nAnd I\\'ve talked about before how in double-blind placebo-controlled studies, people taking one to three grams of omega-3 fatty acids per day, typically in the form of a high-quality fish oil, although there are other sources as well, algae and so forth, can experience improvements in mood that are on par with some of the SSRIs, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.\\nAnd of course, if you\\'re prescribed an SSRI by your psychiatrist or other doctor, please do take that and don\\'t cease to take it just simply to take omega-3s.\\nHowever, you might mention to them, and you can find links to the studies in our previous episodes on depression, that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids at this one gram or more of EPA specifically, so getting above that one gram threshold as high as three grams per day of the EPA has allowed people to take lower doses of SSRIs and still keep their mood in a place that\\'s beneficial for them.\\nAnd in terms of keeping cortisol in a range that\\'s healthy and doesn\\'t bias someone toward high levels of aggression and irritability, that\\'s again going to be set by a number of larger modulators or contextual cues.\\nAnd I\\'ve talked about some of those on the podcast, but I\\'ll just briefly recap them now.\\nObviously getting sunlight in your eyes early in the day and as much sunlight as you safely can in your eyes throughout the day is going to be important.\\nAgain, because of this effect of estrogen in long days, not increasing aggression.\\nHowever, in shorter days, estrogen increases aggression because of the increase in cortisol observed in short days.\\nAnother way to reduce cortisol was discussed in our episode on heat and the use of sauna and heat, but also hot baths.\\nIt turns out that hot baths and sauna can be very beneficial for reducing cortisol.\\nAll the details on that are included in the episode on heat and its timestamps, so you can go directly to that if you want to learn about the temperatures and the various durations, but to just give a synopsis of that, a 20 minute sauna at anywhere from 80 to 100 degrees Celsius is going to be beneficial for reducing cortisol.\\nIf you don\\'t have access to a sauna, you could do a hot bath, adjust the temperature so you don\\'t burn yourself.\\nI think 80 to 100 degrees Celsius is going to be too hot for many people if it\\'s a hot bath, whereas many people who can\\'t tolerate that hot bath can tolerate the sauna.\\nSo safety first always, and of course, but hot baths reduce cortisol.\\nHot saunas reduce cortisol of a duration about 20 to 30 minutes is going to be beneficial.\\nAnd of course, some of you may be interested in exploring the supplementation route.\\nAnd for reductions in cortisol, really the chief player there is ashwagandha, which is known to decrease cortisol fairly potently.\\nI should just warn you that if you\\'re going to use ashwagandha in order to reduce cortisol, first of all, check with your doctor or healthcare provider before adding or subtracting anything from your supplementation or health regimen.\\nOf course, I don\\'t just say that to protect us.\\nI say that to protect you.\\nYou are responsible for your health, what you take and what you don\\'t take.\\nChronic supplementation with ashwagandha can have some not so great effects of disruption of other hormone pathways and neurotransmitter pathways.\\nSo the limit seems to be about two weeks of regular use before you\\'d want to take a break of about two weeks.\\nSo ashwagandha, again, a very potent inhibitor of cortisol, but with some other effects as well.\\nDon\\'t use it chronically for longer than two weeks.\\nBut if your goal is to reduce cortisol, let\\'s say you\\'re going through a period of increased irritability and aggressive tendency, maybe you\\'re also not getting as much light as you would like.\\nAnd perhaps also if there are other circumstantial things leading you towards more aggressiveness and your goal is to reduce aggressiveness, that can be potentially helpful.\\nAnd in light of all this stuff about cortisol and estrogen and day length, I should mention that there are in fact some people who have a genetic predisposition to be more irritable and aggressive.\\nAnd there are a couple of different gene pathways associated with this.\\nWe never like to think about just one gene causing a specific behavior.\\nThe way to think about genes is that genes generally code for things within our biology.\\nIn the context of today\\'s discussion, things like neural circuits or the amounts of neurotransmitters that are made or the amounts of hormones that are made or the amount of neurotransmitter hormone receptors or enzymes, et cetera, that shift the activity of our biology in a particular direction.\\nThey bias our biology.\\nAnd in fact, there is a genetic variant present in certain people that adjusts their estrogen receptor sensitivity.\\nAnd that estrogen receptor sensitivity can result in increased levels of aggression, sometimes dramatic increases.\\nHowever, and also very interestingly, photo period, meaning day length, is a strong modulator of whether or not that aggressiveness turns up or not.\\nWhether or not that person with the particular gene variant is more aggressive or not depends on how long the day is and how long the night is.\\nOne particular study that I like that references this is Trainer et al.\\nThe title of the study is photo period reverses the effects of estrogens on male aggression via genomic and non-genomic pathways.\\nThis was a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\\nWe\\'ll put a reference to this in the show notes, if you\\'d like to explore it further.\\nBut it really points to the fact that rarely, sometimes, but rarely is it the case that just one gene will cause somebody to be hyper aggressive.\\nAlmost always, there\\'s going to be an interplay between genetics and environment.\\nAnd as environment changes, such as day length changes and the length of night changes, so too will the tendency for people with a given genetic variant to be more aggressive or not.\\nNow, of course, in the absence of detailed genetic testing for this particular estrogen receptor variant, most people, I\\'m guessing you, are probably not walking around knowing that you have this gene or not.\\nRegardless, I think it\\'s important to pay attention to how you feel at different times of year, depending on whether or not it\\'s summer, whether or not it\\'s winter, whether or not you\\'re getting sufficient sunlight, meaning viewing sufficient sunlight or not, whether or not you\\'re getting sufficient sunlight exposure to your skin or not, whether or not you\\'re indoors all the time.\\nGenerally, those things correlate with season, but not always.\\nYou can go through long bouts of hard work in the summer months when days are long, but you\\'re indoors a lot and getting a lot of fluorescent light exposure late in the evening, and perhaps that\\'s when you\\'re feeling more aggressive.\\nSo we have to be careful about drawing a one-to-one relationship between any biological feature and certainly psychological or behavioral feature like aggressiveness.\\nBut it\\'s, I believe, helpful to know that these genetic biases exist, how they play out.\\nAgain, they shift our biology in a general thematic direction.\\nThey don\\'t change one thing.\\nThey change a variety of things that bias us toward or away from certain psychological and behavioral outcomes and the various things that we can do in order to offset them.\\nWe described those earlier in terms of trying to keep cortisol low by getting sufficient sunlight, regardless of time of year and regardless of whether or not you happen to have this particular genetic variant.\\nSo earlier I talked about how it is testosterone converted into estrogen that\\'s activating aggression in the ventromedial hypothalamus, not testosterone itself.\\nHowever, there are some studies carried out in humans that have evaluated the effects of testosterone and how levels of testosterone correlate with aggressiveness in the short term.\\nI\\'m just going to detail a few of those studies because I think they are interesting and important.\\nFirst of all, there is a study that has explored levels of testosterone in men of different professions.\\nNow, before I tell you the data, I want to be very clear here.\\nWith a study such as this, one never knows whether or not these men went into a particular profession because they had a testosterone level of a given value or whether or not the work itself altered their testosterone levels or both.\\nAnd I think it\\'s fair to assume that it\\'s probably both.\\nSo be very careful in assuming that a given testosterone level is causal for choosing a particular career or that a particular career is causal for creating a particular testosterone level.\\nThis study used salivary testosterone levels as the measure, which to be fair is not the best way to measure testosterone.\\nTypically blood draw would be the best way to measure testosterone, but nonetheless, provided the appropriate methods are used, salivary testosterone can be a reasonable measure of testosterone.\\nThe different occupations that were looked at were, and here they just looked at men in this particular study, were ministers, salesmen, they didn\\'t say what particular types of salesmen, firemen, professors, of all things, physicians and NFL players.\\nAnd what they discovered was that the testosterone levels were essentially in that order from low to highest.\\nSo minister, salesman, fireman, professor, physician, NFL player.\\nNow we could micro dissect all the different stereotypes and all the different features of each of these jobs.\\nFor instance, we don\\'t know whether or not the fact that the firemen happened, at least in this study, to have lower testosterone levels on average than the professors or the physicians was because firemen have lower testosterone levels or because they have a much more stressful job and their cortisol levels are higher than the professor or the physician and cortisol and testosterone, not always, but generally are in somewhat antagonistic push-pull mode because they derive from the same precursor, et cetera.\\nTypically, when cortisol is high, testosterone tends to be lower and vice versa.\\nSo we don\\'t know what\\'s causing these effects.\\nAnd again, this is just one study and just six occupations, but I think it\\'s relatively interesting given the fact that each of these professions involves different levels of competitiveness, right? So we don\\'t necessarily just want to think about the level of physical exertion that\\'s required, but also the level of competitiveness because it\\'s known that competitive interactions can cause increases in testosterone, in particular in the winners of competitive interactions, a topic for a future podcast.\\nMeanwhile, studies that have analyzed also, again, salivary testosterone in prisoners, in this case, female prisoners, so these are incarcerated individuals, have looked at levels of testosterone according to whether or not the person committed a nonviolent or a violent crime in order to arrive in prison and higher levels of salivary testosterone were related to those that had arrived in prison because of conviction of a violent crime as opposed to a nonviolent crime.\\nLikewise, when they analyzed prison rule violations, so an indirect measure of aggressiveness, but in this case, it was strongly associated with aggressiveness because they knew what the violations were.\\nThey found where for prisoners that had none, no prison violations, prison rule violations, I should say, their testosterone levels tended to be lower than the testosterone levels of women that had some, even one or more aggressive violations of prison rules.\\nWe\\'ll provide links to these studies in the show notes if you\\'d like to go into them further.\\nObviously, studies like this need to be taken with a grain of salt because there are so many different factors, different prisons have different degrees of violence to begin with and competitiveness to begin with, but just as a final pass at examining the role between testosterone and aggressiveness, there was a very interesting study from Gotts et al, G-O-E-T-Z, published in 2014, that looked at serum, so in this case, blood levels of testosterone, 30 minutes after application of a gel-based testosterone that goes transdermal so that the testosterone can go very quickly into the bloodstream and then did brain imaging to evaluate the activity of neurons in the so-called corticomedial amygdala.\\nThe medial amygdala is one of the areas of the amygdala complex, as we call it, because it\\'s complex, it\\'s got a lot of different nuclei, you now know what nuclei are, low clusters of neurons, it\\'s got a lot of different ones, but that medial and that corticomedial amygdala in particular is known to be associated with aggressive type behaviors.\\nIt\\'s linked up with, it\\'s part of the larger circuit that includes the ventromedial hypothalamus and other brain areas that we referred to earlier, such as the P-A-G.\\nWhat is remarkable about this study is that it showed that just 30 minutes after application of this so-called androgel, this testosterone that seeps into the bloodstream, there was a significant increase in, of course, testosterone and corticomedial amygdala activation.\\nSo testosterone can have acute effects, immediate effects on the pathways related to aggression.\\nAnd I think this is something that\\'s not often discussed because many of the effects of steroid hormones like testosterone and estrogen are very slow acting.\\nIn fact, steroid hormones, because they have a certain biochemical composition can actually pass through the membranes of cells.\\nSo the outside of a cell and into the nucleus of the cell and change gene expression in the cell.\\nYou think about puberty, the kid that goes home for the summer and then comes back looking completely different.\\nWell, that\\'s because of a lot of genes got turned on by steroid hormones like testosterone and estrogen.\\nBut the steroid hormones can also have very fast acting effects.\\nAnd with testosterone in particular, those can be remarkably fast acting.\\nAnd one of the most apparent and well-documented fast acting effects is this effect, the ability to activate cells within the amygdala.\\nSo you might say, well, I thought the amygdala was associated with fear.\\nWouldn\\'t testosterone then cause fear? No, it turns out that the amygdala harbors both cortisol, corticosterone receptors and testosterone receptors.\\nAnd they each adjust the activity in the amygdala differently such that testosterone tends to activate amygdala circuitry for inducing states of mind and body that are more action-based.\\nAnd indeed in animals and in humans, testosterone application and activation of this cortico-medial amygdala pathway will make animals and humans lean into effort.\\nThis is why I say testosterone makes effort feel good or at least biases the organism toward leaning into challenge.\\nSo if you recall, there\\'s not just one type of aggression.\\nThere\\'s reactive aggression, which is triggered when one is confronted with something that sometimes is inevitable, right? One needs to fight for their life or for somebody else\\'s life, but also proactive aggression.\\nAnd proactive aggression involves activation of those go pathways in the basal ganglia and a leaning into effort to overcome whatever state one happens to be in to begin with.\\nAnd so this is very important because it points to the fact that yes, estrogen is activating aggression pathways that are in the ventromedial hypothalamus, but it\\'s very likely the case that testosterone is acting to accelerate or to bias states of mind and body toward those that will lead to aggression.\\nAgain, aggression is not like a switch on and off.\\nIt\\'s a process.\\nIt has a beginning, a middle, and an end.\\nRemember that hydraulic pressure that Conrad Lorenz hypothesized? Well, think of testosterone as increasing the pressure toward an aggressive episode and then estrogen actually triggering that aggressive episode in the ventromedial hypothalamus.\\nSo if somebody tells you that testosterone, endogenous, or exogenous makes people aggressive, tell them no.\\nTestosterone tends to make people lean into effort.\\nAnd if that effort involves being aggressive, either reactively aggressive or proactively aggressive, well, then it will indeed lead to aggression, but the actual aggression itself is triggered by estrogen, not testosterone.\\nNow thus far, we really haven\\'t talked too much about the social context in which aggression occurs.\\nAnd that\\'s because there is a near infinite, if not infinite number of variables that will determine that.\\nSo for instance, violent aggression is entirely appropriate at a professional boxing match, provided it\\'s occurring inside the ring and only between the competitors and within the bounds of the rules of the sport, et cetera.\\nHowever, there are some things that tend to bias certain social contexts toward being more aggressive or less aggressive and not always physical aggression.\\nAnd those generally come in two forms that many of you are familiar with, which are alcohol and caffeine.\\nLet\\'s discuss caffeine first.\\nWhy would caffeine increase aggressive impulsivity? Well, the general effects of caffeine are to increase autonomic arousal, the activity of the so-called sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system, which is, to put it very much in plain language, it\\'s the alertness arm of your nervous system.\\nThat is, it creates a sense of readiness in your brain and body.\\nAnd it does so by activating the so-called sympathetic chain ganglia.\\nAgain, as I always remind people, simpa and sympathetic does not mean sympathy.\\nSimpa means together or all at once.\\nAnd caffeine tends to bias our brain and body to activate the sympathetic chain ganglia, which run from about the base of your neck until the top of your pelvis, and deploy a bunch of chemicals that jut out into the rest of your body, activate adrenaline release.\\nThere\\'s a parallel increase of adrenaline in your brain, creating the state of alertness and readiness.\\nThat state of alertness and readiness can be for all sorts of things, not just aggression.\\nHowever, when we are in a state of increased sympathetic tone, meaning more alert, such as after drinking caffeine, we will bias all those brain and body systems, the hormones, the chemicals, et cetera, that exist toward action as opposed to inaction.\\nSo put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity.\\nNo surprise there.\\nOn the opposite end of things, alcohol tends to decrease activity in the sympathetic arm or the autonomic nervous system, tends to make us feel less alert.\\nNow, initially it can create a state of alertness because of its effects in inhibiting the forebrain.\\nOur forebrain prefrontal cortex in particular has what\\'s called top-down inhibition.\\nIt exerts a inhibitory or a quieting effect on some of the circuits of the hypothalamus, such as the ventromedial hypothalamus.\\nThe way to conceptualize this is that your forebrain is able to rationalize and think clearly and to suppress behavior and to engage the no-go pathway.\\nIt\\'s telling you, don\\'t say that mean thing.\\nDon\\'t do that violent thing, et cetera.\\nAlcohol initially tends to increase our level of overall activity by reducing inhibition, not just in that forebrain circuit, but in other circuits tends to make us more active.\\nWe tend to talk more than we normally would, move more than we normally would, but very shortly thereafter starts acting as a sedative by way of reducing activity in the forebrain, releasing some of the deeper brain circuits that are involved in impulsivity, but also causing a somewhat sedative of effect.\\nAnd then of course, as alcohol levels increase even further, people eventually will pass out, blackout, et cetera.\\nSo what we\\'ve got with alcohol and caffeine is we\\'ve got two opposite ends of the spectrum, caffeine increasing arousal and readiness and the tendency for impulsivity and alcohol also increasing impulsivity, but through a different mechanism.\\nA really interesting study, and I should just mention that the title of the study is caffeinated and non-caffeinated alcohol use and indirect aggression, the impact of self-regulation.\\nSo the title is almost self-explanatory.\\nThis was a paper published in the Journal of Addictive Behavior in 2016, examining how ingestion of alcohol that\\'s either caffeinated or non-caffeinated alcohol drinks impacted what they call indirect aggression.\\nAnd just to remind you what indirect aggression is, these are not physical acts of aggression, these are verbal acts of aggression.\\nSo embarrassing others or otherwise somehow trying to reduce the wellbeing of others by saying certain things in particular in groups.\\nThis study examined both males and females.\\nThis was done by way of a college campus study.\\nSubjects were 18 to 47 years old.\\nI guess there\\'s some older students on that campus or maybe they use some non-students, but these days you\\'ve also got some students that are in their thirties and forties.\\nSo they have a fairly broad swath of subjects included, fairly broad racial background as well, included not at equal numbers, but at least they included a pretty broad spectrum of people with different backgrounds.\\nThey looked in particular at people that ingested non-caffeinated alcohol drinks at a frequency of 9.18 drinks per week.\\nOkay, again, there\\'s a college campus, not that I encourage that.\\nI\\'m one of these people that I\\'ve never really liked.\\nDrugs are alcohol and so we\\'re fortunate in that way.\\nI can drink or not drink and tend to not drink.\\nBut so to me, 9.18 drinks per week sounds like a lot, but I know for some people that might actually be typical.\\nAnd then others who were drinking at least one caffeinated alcoholic beverage per week.\\nAnd those individuals end as high, I should say, as 7.87 caffeinated alcohol beverages per week.\\nSo this would be energy drinks combined typically with hard alcohol that\\'s fairly commonly available in bars and so forth.\\nAnd some individuals drank as much as, goodness, 20.36 alcoholic drinks per week total, some that were caffeinated, some that were not caffeinated.\\nThe basic outcome of this study was that the more alcohol someone tended to consume, the more likely it was that they would engage in these indirect aggressive type behaviors.\\nAnd in terms of the caffeinated alcoholic beverages, there the effect was especially interesting.\\nHere, I\\'m just going to paraphrase or I\\'ll actually read from the study.\\nQuote, with regard to caffeinated alcoholic beverage use, our findings indicated that heavier caffeinated alcohol beverage use was associated positively with indirect aggression even after considering one\\'s typical alcohol use and dispositional aggression.\\nWhat this means is that even though alcohol can bias certain individuals to be more aggressive, and even though certain individuals already have a disposition toward being more aggressive, there was an effect that was independent, meaning above and beyond both alcohol and a predisposition, meaning if someone was consuming caffeinated alcoholic beverages, they had a particularly high likelihood of engaging in indirect aggressive behavior.\\nNow, this makes perfect sense in light of the model they propose, which is this self-regulation model that basically self-regulation involves several things.\\nIt involves engaging in certain behaviors and suppressing other behaviors.\\nSo as described before, because alcohol tends to have a sedative, suppressive effect on the autonomic nervous system, at least after the initial period, it\\'s going to tend to reduce the likelihood that people will engage in any type of behavior, whereas caffeine will increase autonomic arousal and increase the likelihood that someone will engage in a particular type of behavior, aggressive or otherwise.\\nSo the combination of caffeine and alcohol is really acting as a two-prong system to bias people towards more impulsivity, that is less self-regulation.\\nSo it\\'s really yanking your volitional control, your ability to engage in prefrontal top-down inhibition over your hypothalamus from two distinct and specific circuits.\\nBy now, you should be getting the impression that self-regulation is a key feature of whether or not somebody, maybe even you, is going to engage in aggressive speech or aggressive behavior.\\nAnd we\\'ve talked about a number of tools that one can use to reduce the probability that that will happen.\\nI suppose if the context were appropriate, you could even take those tool recommendations and just invert them and increase the likelihood that aggressiveness would happen.\\nBut regardless, self-regulation is key.\\nAnd in light of that, I want to share with you a study that\\'s focused on kids, but that has important ramifications for adults as well.\\nAs you probably are already aware, there are many kids out there that suffer from so-called attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD.\\nThere are also many adults we are finding that are suffering from ADHD.\\nAnd there is also an epidemic, I would say, of people that are concerned about whether or not they have ADHD.\\nNow, whether or not they have true clinical ADHD or not is not clear.\\nWe did an episode all about ADHD and tools for ADHD.\\nI would encourage you to check out that episode and some of the diagnostic criteria.\\nIf you have the opportunity, you can find that at hubermanlab.com.\\nAs this study I\\'m about to share with you aptly points out, there is no objective diagnostic marker of ADHD.\\nThere\\'s no biomarker or blood draw or blood test for ADHD.\\nWhether or not one has ADHD depends on their performance on a number of different cognitive tests and behavioral tests and self-report.\\nIn any event, the study I\\'m about to share with you explored how a particular pattern of supplementation in kids with ADHD was able to reduce aggressive episodes and impulsivity and increase self-regulation.\\nAnd the title of the study is efficacy of carnitine in the treatment of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\\nEven though they put carnitine in the title, that what they focused on was whether or not acetyl-L-carnitine supplementation could somehow adjust the behavioral tendency of these kids with ADHD.\\nAnd to make a long story short, indeed it did.\\nThere was a very significant effect of acetyl-carnitine supplementation on improving some of the symptomology of ADHD.\\nA few details about the study that might be relevant to you.\\nThis was a randomized double-blind placebo control double crossover study.\\nThis was done as an outpatient study.\\nSo the kids weren\\'t in a hospital.\\nThey were living out in the world.\\nThis again was done on younger kids.\\nSo this was six to 13 year old kids that were diagnosed with ADHD.\\nThey received either acetyl-L-carnitine or placebo.\\nAnd they did all the good practice stuff that good researchers do of making sure that the placebo and the acetyl-L-carnitine had similar look and taste.\\nIt was consumed twice daily after meals.\\nNow she just mentioned that acetyl-L-carnitine typically is taken in capsule form or occasionally in injectable form here.\\nThey were using this as a drink, which is essentially the same as capsule form, but the powder is just going directly into liquid.\\nAnd the carnitine dosage was 100 milligrams per kilogram.\\nSo they\\'re doing this according to the body weight of these kids with a maximum dosage of four grams per day.\\nThe quantity of the medication was supplied here.\\nI\\'m reading for a period of eight weeks and every eight weeks a new quantity of medication was supplied.\\nSo basically this is a fairly long-term study exploring behavioral outcomes and psychological outcomes in week eight, 16 and 24.\\nThey also looked at things that you could only get through a blood draw.\\nSo things like hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, et cetera.\\nThese are kids and even if it were adults, they were quite appropriately examining a lot of the physiological measures that one would want to carry out to make sure first of all, that blood levels of carnitine are increasing and indeed they confirm that, but also that no negative effects are showing up in the physiology as well as the psychology of these kids.\\nSo first I\\'ll just tell you the basic outcome of the study, which was here I\\'m paraphrasing, given twice daily carnitine appeared to be effective and well-tolerated treatment for a group of children with ADHD, they showed significantly abnormal behavior compared to these other boys.\\nAnd now I\\'m moving to the table of results.\\nThey showed significant reductions in their so-called total problem score.\\nThe total problem score is a well-established measure of behavioral problems in kids with ADHD.\\nAnd I should say adults with ADHD has to do with challenges in social and learning environments and how well or poorly an individual tends to perform.\\nReductions in attentional problems overall, reductions in delinquency and most important for sake of today\\'s discussion, significant reductions in aggressive behavior.\\nNow, what\\'s especially nice about this study, I think, is that even though it was a relatively small number of subjects and certainly needs to be repeated in other studies and other laboratories, that they were able to confirm the shifts in L-carnitine within the bloodstream of these kids.\\nThat is they were able to correlate the physiology with the psychological changes.\\nIn studies like this, and frankly, in all studies of human pharmacology, you have to worry about effects that show up, not just because of placebo effects, but because of so-called off-target effects or related things totally independent of the drug or the particular supplement that you happen to be looking at.\\nTo put it in the words of a great neuroscientist, unfortunately, he passed away some years ago, but he was a member of the National Academy, extremely accomplished neuroscientist, once turned to me and said, never forget a drug is a substance that when injected into an animal or a human being, creates a paper.\\nMeaning you can see effects of pretty much any drug or any supplement in most all conditions.\\nHowever, it is in cases such as this study where you can quite convincingly see that the particular feature of physiology that you expected to change actually changed.\\nAnd you see a psychological outcome that you can gain much greater confidence that the changes in delinquency, in this case, reduced delinquency, improved attention, reduced aggressiveness and so forth, was at least somehow related to the shift in blood physiology and levels of L-carnitine or acetyl L-carnitine and carnitine in the bloodstream of these children, as opposed to something else like L-carnitine going and affecting some downstream target that you have no knowledge of.\\nNow, of course, that\\'s still entirely possible, but I think studies such as these increase our confidence that things like L-carnitine can be used perhaps in concert with things like omega-3 supplementation, diets that are biased towards increasing more tryptophan and therefore more serotonin, obviously avoiding things like alcohol.\\nAnd as it appears from the study I just described, reducing one\\'s intake or not consuming any caffeinated alcoholic beverages, seems like it would be a good idea if your goal is to reduce aggressiveness, to think about the hormone context.\\nAnd whether or not you tend to have higher testosterone and estrogen or lower testosterone and estrogen, maybe even think about the work environment, whether or not you are existing in a particularly competitive work environment and even daylife, time of year, and whether or not you\\'re getting sufficient sunlight, whether or not you\\'re avoiding light in the evening and so on.\\nSo studies such as this, I think are useful because they point to the fact that very seldom, if ever, will there be one supplement or one nutritional change or even one behavioral change that\\'s going to completely shift an individual from being aggressive and impulsive, but rather that by combining different behavioral regimens, by paying attention to things like time of year and work conditions and school conditions and overall levels of stress and likely therefore levels of cortisol, et cetera, that you can use behaviors, diet and supplementation as a way to shift that overall internal milieu from one of providing a lot of internal hydraulic pressure as it\\'s been called throughout the episode toward aggressive impulsivity and relax some of that hydraulic pressure and reduce aggressive tendencies.\\nSo once again, and frankly, as always, we\\'ve done a deep dive into the neurobiology and the psychology of what I believe to be an important feature of our lives, in this case, aggression.\\nI want to point out that in a episode in the not too distant future, I\\'m going to be hosting Dr. Professor David Anderson from Caltech University, who is the world expert on the neurobiology of aggression.\\nIn fact, he is the senior author on many of the studies related to the ventromedial hypothalamus that I discussed today.\\nOur discussion will touch on aggression, of course.\\nSo hearing today\\'s episode will help you digest that information, but we are also going to talk about other emotional states.\\nHe is an expert not just in aggression, but in motivated states related to sex and mating behavior, social relationships of all kinds, and how those relate not just to biology and psychology, but also certain forms of pathology, things like PTSD and the relationship, for instance, between anger, fear, anxiety, and depression, and many other important topics that I know many of you, if not all of you, will be interested in.\\nIn the meantime, I want to point you to his recently released and wonderful book entitled The Nature of the Beast, How Emotions Guide Us.\\nAnd again, the author is David Anderson from Caltech.\\nThis is a wonderful book.\\nIt serves as a tremendous introduction to the history of the study of these areas, the current science and discoveries being made in these areas, all made accessible to the scientist and non-scientist alike.\\nIt\\'s a very engaging read.\\nAnd so much so that even though he was gracious in sending me a copy, I also purchased myself a copy to give to somebody who is a therapist, and I\\'ve purchased another copy to give to a high school kid that I mentor because he\\'s very interested in the neuroscience of emotions.\\nAnd I think we are all interested in emotions, not just fear and some of these negative states, not just aggression, but also the positive emotions of our lives.\\nAnd so The Nature of the Beast, How Emotions Guide Us by David Anderson is a wonderful read.\\nI can\\'t recommend it highly enough.\\nIf you\\'re learning from and or enjoying this podcast, please subscribe to our YouTube

       " Document(page_content=\"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.\\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.\\nToday we are discussing psilocybin.\\nPsilocybin is a psychedelic, meaning it modifies the psyche.\\nAnd in doing so, it changes our level of consciousness.\\nPsychedelics such as psilocybin change the way that we perceive the outside world and our internal world, our memories, our thoughts, our feelings, et cetera, not just while one is under the influence of psilocybin, but it can also fundamentally change all of those things afterwards and for a very long period of time afterwards as well, which is one of the reasons why there's growing excitement about the application of psilocybin and other psychedelics for the treatment of various mental health issues, such as depression, alcohol abuse disorder, and addictions of various kinds, as well as things like OCD and eating disorders.\\nToday we will discuss psilocybin, talking about what it is.\\nIn fact, you may be surprised to learn that psilocybin basically is serotonin.\\nNow, for those of you that are familiar with psilocybin and serotonin, you might think, wait, that's not true.\\nBut in fact, psilocybin's main effect is to mimic serotonin, but it does it in a very specific way because it activates a subset of serotonin receptors in a very strong fashion, leading to neuroplasticity at the level of the neural circuits, that is the brain areas and connections that serve things like memory and perception.\\nSo if any of that is confusing at this point, I promise to make it all clear in just a few minutes.\\nPsilocybin is one of many psychedelics, of course.\\nThere are things like LSD, DMT, 5-MeO, DMT, even MDMA, while not considered a classic psychedelic, is considered a psychedelic in the general sense.\\nToday's episode is going to focus on psilocybin in particular.\\nI will tell you what psilocybin is, how it works at the molecular and cellular level.\\nI'll talk about how it changes brain circuitry.\\nI'll talk about the clinical effects, what's been demonstrated in controlled laboratory studies.\\nI'll talk about dosages and translating from psilocybin mushrooms to actual psilocybin, and the compound that actually exerts the effects of psilocybin, which it turns out is not psilocybin, but something called psilocin.\\nPsilocin is the actual compound that goes into the brain to create all the changes in consciousness and all the rewiring effects that we associate with psilocybin.\\nSo understanding how psilocybin is converted to psilocin has tremendous impact on the duration of a psilocybin journey, whether or not that psilocybin journey is going to lead to a short or longer window for neuroplasticity.\\nIn fact, many people don't realize this, but much of the positive changes that are possible with proper, and I do want to underscore, proper psilocybin therapeutic approaches takes place after the session in which one feels all the typical or typically associated effects of psilocybin, like hallucinations and changes in thought patterns, et cetera.\\nSo today we are going to talk a little bit about chemistry, but I promise to make it accessible to anyone and everyone, regardless of whether or not you have a background in chemistry or biology.\\nWe're going to talk about some cell biology, the actual neuronal changes that occur when one takes psilocybin, and we're going to talk about how neural circuits change over time and how all of that impacts the changes that most people are interested in when they go on a psilocybin journey, things such as longstanding improvements in mood, things such as tremendous insight into themselves and to others, into their past, their present, and their future, and even changes in their levels of creativity or their ability to experience joy from music or their ability to dissociate in a positive way from things that formerly were depressing or triggers for depression.\\nIn fact, we're going to talk quite a lot about the conditions inside of a psilocybin journey that make it actually positive and therapeutic.\\nThis is a very important point that I'll make several times throughout today's episode, which is that just because something invokes neuroplasticity, changes in brain circuitry, does not mean that it's therapeutic, or I should say does not necessarily mean that it's therapeutic.\\nFor neuroplasticity to be therapeutic, it has to be adaptive.\\nIt has to allow someone to function better in life than they did previously.\\nSo today we will talk about how the conditions of a psilocybin journey, including whether or not it's done with eyes closed or eyes open, or whether or not people alternate between eyes closed and eyes open phases of that journey, as well as whether or not music is played during that journey, and even what types of music are played will dictate whether or not somebody will feel better or worse in the days and weeks and years following that psilocybin journey, as well as the dosage level, because as you'll soon learn as well, there are clinical studies showing that just one psilocybin journey can improve mood in a longstanding way, but most clinical trials involve two dosages, spaced in very precise ways from one another with appropriate follow-up, but in both of those particular journeys, the structure of the journey, who's present, who's not present, eyes open or eyes closed, the particular music that's played, all of those features make up part of a larger neuroplasticity trigger of which psilocybin is critical, but psilocybin is not the only variable.\\nSo whether or not you're interested in participating in a clinical study or whether or not you're interested in psilocybin for other reasons, this is critical information to understand.\\nSo today we're going to talk about nearly every feature of psilocybin possible, including what psilocybin is, how it works at the level of chemistry, cell biology and neural networks and neuroplasticity.\\nWe'll talk about the clinical studies, we'll talk about dosages, we will talk about conditions of clinical studies and we will talk about the post psilocybin journey period in which neuroplasticity and the various activities, including therapy or perhaps not therapy, can contribute to positive therapeutic changes from psilocybin.\\nNow, as we go into this discussion, I do want to underscore the fact that at the time of recording this episode, meaning now, May, 2023, psilocybin is still a schedule one drug.\\nIt is considered illegal in the United States.\\nThere's perhaps just one exception to that, maybe a few others, but the main exception is in the state of Oregon, psilocybin has been approved in particular therapeutic settings for use in particular conditions, namely depression and some forms of addiction.\\nSo in Oregon, it's more or less in the domain of a decriminalized as opposed to actually legal.\\nIn other areas of the country, including Oakland, California, there's some areas in which it has been decriminalized and perhaps there are a few others that I'm not aware of, but in general, psilocybin and other psychedelics are still considered illegal.\\nAnd this is very important, not just saying this to protect me, I'm saying this to protect you, possessing or certainly selling psilocybin except for rare instances such as clinical studies and these decriminalized areas that I talked about a moment ago is still very much not allowed under the law.\\nToday, I'll also discuss safety issues.\\nI'll talk about whether or not young people, meaning people 25 or younger should consider psilocybin given that their brain is still in a rampant period of naturally occurring neuroplasticity.\\nI will also talk about dosages as it relates to people who have formerly been on or may currently be on different forms of antidepressants.\\nAnd I will talk about people who are at risk for psychotic episodes, either because they know they themselves have a propensity for psychosis or they have close family members who have psychosis, which includes things like schizophrenia, bipolar depression, as well as things like borderline personality and some related psychiatric conditions.\\nSo today's episode really will be a deep dive into psilocybin.\\nSo whether or not you think you're already familiar with psilocybin and its effects or whether or not you're just curious about them, I do encourage, if you're willing, to try and ratchet through some of the understanding of how psilocybin works and what it is, leading up to some of the therapeutic applications and different patterns of dosing, spacing of different sessions, et cetera, because I do believe that with that knowledge in hand, you will be able to make far better, much more informed decisions about whether or not psilocybin is right for you.\\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.\\nIt is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public.\\nIn keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.\\nOur first sponsor is 8 Sleep.\\n8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating and sleep tracking capacity.\\nNow, sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health and performance.\\nEverything goes far better when we are sleeping well on a consistent basis.\\nNow, one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is to make sure that the temperature of your sleeping environment is correct.\\nIn fact, your body temperature has to drop by one to three degrees in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep.\\nAnd waking up involves a heating up of your body by about one to three degrees.\\nWith 8 Sleep, you can program your mattress to be a specific temperature at the beginning, middle and towards the end of your sleep night.\\nEver since I started sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress, I've slept far better than I ever have.\\nSo it's an all around great tool that has tremendous functionality, not just for measuring, but for improving your sleep.\\nIf you'd like to try 8 Sleep, you can go to 8sleep.com slash Huberman and save $150 off their pod three cover.\\n8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK, select countries in the EU and Australia.\\nAgain, that's 8sleep.com slash Huberman.\\nToday's episode is also brought to us by Roca.\\nRoca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality.\\nNow I've spent a lifetime working on the biology, the visual system, and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order to make sure that you can see clearly under any conditions.\\nRoca understands all of that and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses so that regardless of whether or not you're in a very brightly lit area or a more shady area, or you go from brightly lit to shady areas, you can always see with tremendous clarity.\\nNow, even though they were initially designed for sport, Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses come in a tremendous number of different aesthetics.\\nSo they have the kind of what I call cyborg versions that most people associate with triathlon glasses and sports related glasses, but they also have a tremendous number of frames that you feel perfectly comfortable wearing to work or out to dinner, et cetera.\\nIf you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses, you can go to roca, that's R-O-K-A.com and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order.\\nAgain, that's roca, R-O-K-A.com and enter the code Huberman at checkout.\\nToday's episode is also brought to us by HVMN Ketone IQ.\\nKetone IQ is a ketone supplement that increases blood ketones.\\nNow I know most people are familiar or at least have heard of the so-called ketogenic diet, which is essentially a very low carbohydrate diet.\\nIt's designed to get your brain and body functioning off ketones, which are a great source of fuel for the body and brain.\\nHowever, most people, including myself, are not ketogenic.\\nThat is, I'm not in a ketosis state, pretty much ever as far as I know.\\nNonetheless, with ketone IQ, you can increase your blood ketones and thereby improve things like cognition and physical performance.\\nI find that when taking ketone IQ, even if I'm eating a standard omnivore diet, which is the diet that I follow, by taking ketone IQ prior to workouts, sometimes on an empty stomach, and especially prior to doing any kind of cognitive work, so researching podcasts or doing work related to my lab or teaching, et cetera, that I can maintain mental clarity for a longer period of time.\\nAnd it does seem to enhance my mental clarity as well.\\nIf you'd like to try ketone IQ, you can go to HVMN.com and use the code Huberman to get 20% off.\\nAgain, that's HVMN.com and use the code Huberman to get 20% off.\\nLet's talk about psilocybin.\\nAnd again, today we're going to focus specifically on psilocybin and we're going to set aside all the other psychedelics for future episodes.\\nPsilocybin is what's called a tryptamine.\\nThat refers to its chemical composition, not to the so-called psychedelic tryp.\\nIn fact, it's spelled differently.\\nTryptamine is T-R-Y-P, trypt-R-I-P, of course.\\nTryptamines include psilocybin, but also things like DMT and 5MAO-DMT.\\nThe tryptamine psychedelics very closely resemble serotonin itself.\\nThat's right.\\nMost of you have probably heard of the chemical serotonin.\\nAnd serotonin is what's called a neuromodulator, which means your brain and body naturally make it and that it modifies or changes the activity of other neurons and neural circuits.\\nAnd it does that generally by either increasing or decreasing the activity of those neural circuits.\\nIf I were to show you a picture of the chemical structure of psilocybin or its active derivative, psilocin, and I were to also put right alongside it an image of the chemical structure of serotonin, provided that you weren't a chemist who really likes to focus on the detailed differences between things, you would say those look very similar.\\nAnd indeed psilocybin and its active form, psilocin, are very similar structurally and chemically to serotonin itself.\\nNow, as I mentioned before, serotonin is something that you naturally make.\\nAnd yes, it's true that about 90% of the serotonin in your brain and body is manufactured in your gut.\\nHowever, contrary to popular belief, the serotonin in your brain is not manufactured from the serotonin in your gut.\\nYou have separate independent sources of serotonin.\\nThat is you have particular neurons that make serotonin in your brain.\\nYou also have serotonin in your gut and those work more or less in parallel separately.\\nNow, what does serotonin do? This is really important to understand because of the similarity between psilocybin and its active form, psilocin and serotonin.\\nSerotonin in that it's a neuromodulator, changes the activity of other neurons and the net effects of those changes are things that you're familiar with.\\nFor instance, satiety or the feeling that we've had enough of various things, such as food or a social interaction or sex or pleasure of any kind.\\nSerotonin is involved in all of that and an enormous number of other things, such as mood regulation, such as our sense of pleasure itself or lack of pleasure, such as whether or not we feel motivated or not motivated.\\nIt works in concert with other neuromodulators, such as dopamine and epinephrine and norepinephrine.\\nIn fact, if this were an episode about serotonin, which it is not, you would soon realize that serotonin is involved in so many different functions that impact our daily life.\\nAnd that is one reason why certain antidepressant medications, which alter either increase or decrease the amount of serotonin transmission in the brain, will often have a lot of side effects related to things like mood, libido, appetite, sleep, et cetera.\\nIt's because serotonin is involved in so many different things.\\nAnd serotonin is involved in so many different things because there are a lot of different so-called serotonin receptors.\\nSerotonin is a chemical that we call a ligand, and the chemical ligand is simply the thing that plugs into the receptor for that chemical or ligand.\\nThe receptors, in this case serotonin receptors, have the opportunity to do all sorts of different things.\\nThey can change the activity of neurons, making them more active or less active.\\nThey can cause growth factors to be released, making sure that those neurons reinforce or even build up stronger connections so that they're more likely to be active in the future.\\nSerotonin binding to particular receptors can even change the gene expression in particular cells, making those cells proliferate, so make more of them, making those cells more robust, making those cells, they interact with new elements of the brain and body.\\nBasically, serotonin and all these different receptors that it binds to has dozens, if not hundreds, and maybe even thousands of different functions.\\nSo the fact that psilocybin so closely resembles serotonin leads to a very important question that we should all be asking ourselves, which is why is it that psilocybin, which looks so much like serotonin, when one takes it in the form of magic mushrooms or some other form, maybe the synthetic form of psilocybin itself, which nowadays is manufactured in laboratories and placed in different psilocybin containing foods and pills, et cetera, why that leads to complex yet fairly circumscribed sets of experience like visual and auditory hallucinations, changes in particular thought patterns and neuroplasticity that, in many cases, in the clinical setting, provided things are done correctly, improvements in mood, relief from depression, relief from various compulsive disorders, et cetera, right? This is really what you need to understand if you want to understand psilocybin and how it works and how to make it work optimally for a given condition or goal.\\nYou have to understand what it's actually doing and what allows psilocybin to do fairly specific things in comparison to serotonin, even though psilocybin and serotonin are so similar, is that psilocybin mainly binds to and activates the so-called serotonin 2A receptor.\\nThe serotonin 2A receptor is one of, again, many different serotonin receptors, but serotonin 2A is expressed in particular areas of the brain and even on particular areas of neurons in the brain that allow for very specific types of changes in neural circuitry to take place, not just when one is under the influence of psilocybin, but afterwards as well.\\nSo really, in order to have a useful discussion about psilocybin, we need to talk a lot about the serotonin 2A receptor.\\nBut fortunately for you, unless you're somebody really interested in structural biology or cell biology, that discussion is not going to be about the binding pocket for serotonin on serotonin 2A receptor or a lot of the downstream signaling of the serotonin 2A receptor.\\nWe'll talk a little bit about that where it's relevant, but more importantly, at least for sake of today's discussion, we're going to talk about how the serotonin 2A receptor is really the one responsible for triggering all the changes in neural circuitry that lead to the changes, that is the improvements in mood, the relief from compulsive disorders in many cases, but really it's the serotonin 2A receptor selectivity of psilocybin that is leading to all the excitement that you hear about in terms of psilocybin as a therapeutic tool.\\nLet me say that from a slightly different angle.\\nThere are data that I'll talk about today, which show that one, although in most cases, two psilocybin journeys done with particular dosages of psilocybin lead to maximal binding or occupancy of those serotonin 2A receptors in ways that lead to significant and unprecedented relief for major depression.\\nIn fact, you'll soon learn that the clinical trials for psilocybin are outperforming standard therapy and outperforming so-called SSRIs and various other antidepressants in terms of providing depression relief in ways that are frankly staggering, not just to me, but to the psychiatric community at large.\\nAnd this is where so much of the excitement is coming from.\\nNow, that statement could be taken one way, which is to just say, okay, well, here's a compound psilocybin that outperforms SSRIs, and therefore all the attention should be on psilocybin.\\nBut SSRI stands for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.\\nIn other words, the SSRIs, of which there's now a lot of controversy, things like Prozac, Zoloft, et cetera.\\nI'm sure you've heard some of this controversy.\\nThere are people who are very pro SSRIs, although there are a growing number of people who really feel that the SSRIs are probably most appropriate for things like obsessive compulsive disorder, where they in fact can be very beneficial.\\nBut there's a lot of kind of leaning back from SSRIs as the be all end all for the treatment of depression nowadays because of the side effect profiles.\\nAnd the fact that it's not even really clear that serotonin deficiencies are the major cause of depression in the first place.\\nNow, again, we're talking about psilocybin, not about SSRIs, but you should be thinking, wait, how is it that two molecules, psilocybin and some particular SSRI, both of which look like and or increase serotonin transmission in the brain are leading to either incredibly positive and interesting outcomes, or to kind of troubling side effect riddled outcomes.\\nAnd again, it all boils back down to the selectivity of psilocybin to bind that serotonin to a receptor.\\nAnd so in order to understand how psilocybin works and in order to understand proper dosing profiles and spacing of sessions, AKA journeys, we really need to talk a little bit more about the serotonin 2A receptor, where it is in the brain, what sorts of things happen when psilocybin binds the serotonin 2A receptor and how those things set in motion, the various changes, the neuroplasticity that allows people to feel better in terms of their mood.\\nAnd as you'll soon learn, can experience more pleasure and joy from things like music and enhanced creativity, all the things that I do believe, whether or not people are thinking about or maybe even exploring psilocybin for recreational or therapeutic purposes, all the things that people want and are really talking about and perhaps even doing psilocybin in order to obtain.\\nSo before going any further, I just want to place an image in your mind.\\nYou can place an image in your mind whereby when serotonin is released in the brain naturally, not having taken any compound, any drug, anything, it's getting released at a lot of different sites, binding to a lot of different serotonin receptors, doing a lot of different things.\\nWhen somebody takes an SSRI, the net effect of that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor is that there's more serotonin around to exert its effects.\\nBecause it's a reuptake inhibitor at the synapse, the connections between neurons, the serotonin can do its thing more extensively and for longer periods of time, but it's doing it kind of non-specifically.\\nSo when you think about standard antidepressant treatments, at least for sake of this discussion, you kind of think of a sprinkling or a kind of spraying of serotonin at different locations in the brain and binding to lots of different receptors.\\nWhereas when you think about psilocybin, even though the subjective effects are pretty diverse, we'll talk about those in a few moments, what you're really talking about is a molecule psilocybin that looks a lot like serotonin that is selectively and very strongly binding to and activating that serotonin 2A receptor.\\nSo that's the image I'd like you to embed in your mind.\\nAnd then the next image I'd like you to embed in your mind is where these serotonin 2A receptors are located in the brain.\\nThe serotonin 2A receptors are located in multiple brain regions, but they have a tremendous amount of expression in the so-called neocortex, the outside of the brain that includes things like our prefrontal cortex, which is involved in understanding context, which behaviors, thoughts, and speech patterns are appropriate for certain circumstances, how to switch context and category switch when you go from playing sports to hanging out with friends to being in a professional setting, you change your behavior in the way that you speak and perhaps even the way that you think.\\nYou might think some things that are out of context, but you probably keep those to yourself and your ability to keep those to yourself are dependent on a functional prefrontal cortex.\\nThere are a lot of 5-HT2A, and by the way, 5-HT is the abbreviation for serotonin.\\nSo there are a lot of serotonin 2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex.\\nAlso in other areas of the cortex that are associated with sensation and perception, that is hearing of sounds, that is seeing of particular things.\\nAnd in particular, there is a very, very, very high expression of serotonin 2A receptors in the visual cortex.\\nAnd that is one of the reasons why psilocybin triggers visual hallucinations.\\nAnd provided psilocybin is present at sufficient enough concentration, that is taken at a sufficient dosage, one will experience profound visual hallucinations regardless of whether or not their eyes are open or their eyes are closed.\\nNow that's an important fact because it explains one of the major effects of psilocybin that people experience while they are on the drug.\\nNow, as I'll talk about a little bit later in terms of what constitutes a useful psilocybin session, useful meaning that it's leading to adaptive improvements in mood, adaptive improvements in creativity and cognition, et cetera, is that people not have their eyes open for at least the majority of the psilocybin session.\\nThis is something I've discussed with several experts who are running clinical studies on psilocybin in their laboratories, some of whom are going to be guests on the Huberman Lab podcast in upcoming episodes.\\nAnd I can't underscore this enough.\\nBecause your visual cortex contains so many of these serotonin 2A receptors, and because psilocybin binds so strongly to that serotonin 2A receptor, you're going to experience a lot of visual hallucinations when you are under the influence of psilocybin.\\nThere's no surprise there.\\nThis has been known for hundreds, if not thousands of years.\\nIt's one of the main reasons why people take psilocybin.\\nHowever, as I mentioned earlier, these hallucinations occur even when the eyes are closed.\\nAnd it's now fairly well established that if people are to take psilocybin and have their eyes open, much of their cognition, much of their thinking, much of the time spent in that psilocybin journey is focused on the altered perceptions of things in the outside environment.\\nSometimes this looks like a sort of a fracturing of the outside world into kind of geometric shapes.\\nSometimes it appears as a kind of melting of things in the visual environment, including people's faces or a morphing of people's faces.\\nAll of that has a strong, let's just call it a draw for a lot of people who are looking for a highly unusual experience inside of the psilocybin journey.\\nBut I think if one's goal is to derive the long lasting benefit from the psilocybin experience, it's very clear that having an eye mask or some other eye covering or something that ensures that one's eyes are closed for the majority, if not the entire psilocybin session is going to be very useful because it's going to limit the extent to which one is focused on those outside changes in visual perception, aka hallucinations, and rather will allow the person to go inward to combine whatever it is that they happen to be seeing in their mind's eye with the different thoughts and memories and changes in their emotions that are occurring.\\nAnd that going inward by staying in the eye mask, at least for the majority of the time, seems to be a very, if not the critical feature of making the psilocybin journey effective in the therapeutic sense.\\nNow, once again, I want to cue to some of the safety precautions here.\\nI'm going to say this at least three times throughout today's episode.\\nAs I'm talking now and various other times throughout today's episode, you may get the impression that I'm all for everybody doing psilocybin, and that is simply not the case.\\nIn order for a psilocybin journey to be therapeutically useful, it does require certain conditions and supports, and there are certain people for which psilocybin use is going to be contraindicated, meaning they should not do psilocybin.\\nIn particular, people who have existing or have a predisposition to psychotic episodes or bipolar episodes.\\nEven having a first relative who has bipolar or schizophrenic or schizotypal issues can be a rule-out condition that can get someone eliminated from a clinical study on psilocybin for fear of triggering psychotic episodes, not just during the psilocybin journey, but potentially in a longstanding way.\\nSo again, that's really critical.\\nThe other thing is that everything I'm talking about today, unless I say otherwise, is really focused on adults, meaning people who are 25 years old or older, that is their basic wiring and rewiring of the brain that we call developmental neuroplasticity, is completed.\\nMost of the studies today that I'll talk about involve subjects ranging from 25 years of age out to about 70 years of age, but no one younger.\\nSo again, psilocybin and its use is certainly not for everybody.\\nIt's still illegal.\\nIt's being used in the clinical setting and research setting.\\nThere are these pockets of decriminalized areas and potentially soon legalization of psilocybin, but again, only in the proper clinical setting.\\nOkay, again, I say that not just to protect myself, but I say that also to protect all of you.\\nPsilocybin is a powerful, powerful drug, not just to be under the influence of, but also in terms of its longstanding changes after the effects of psilocybin have worn off.\\nI'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.\\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational

the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.\\nLet's talk a little bit about dosing of psilocybin and also about microdosing of psilocybin.\\nNow, this is an area that I wouldn't say is controversial, but that there's, how should we say this? There's a lot of loose thinking around this in the non-clinical, non-research communities.\\nBut within the clinical and research communities, there's a lot of data that's come out indicating what effective and safe doses, provided all other things are considered safe, safe doses of psilocybin actually are.\\nAnd here we really can go back to our discussion of psilocybin as quote unquote magic mushrooms or mushrooms.\\nAnd if one were to translate from the mushroom form of psilocybin to the psilocybin that's actually used in various studies, because frankly, in these studies, people aren't eating mushrooms.\\nThey're typically taking synthetic psilocybin, either intravenously injected into a vein or orally.\\nAnd that's how the researchers are able to tightly control the amount of psilocybin.\\nAnd the typical dosage that's used in clinical studies ranges from one milligram, often given repeatedly from day to day over long periods of time, so-called microdosing.\\nAnd really that one milligram per day or even up to three milligrams per day, repeatedly over time is what people generally think of as microdosing as compared to say a 10 milligram dose given once, maybe twice in two separate sessions, or a 25 to 30 milligram dosage that's given once or twice.\\nNow, those amounts of one to three milligrams or 10 milligrams or 25 to 30 milligrams might not mean much to those of you that don't think about these things in the research terms.\\nPerhaps you've heard of microdosing and you've also heard of macro or quote unquote heroic dosing, okay? That's sort of a common, or I should say popular nomenclature for psychedelics.\\nAnd I'll circle back to that in a few minutes.\\nBut I think one of the questions that I hear a lot is how much psilocybin is present in a given amount of mushrooms.\\nAnd so the way this typically works is that mushrooms are often discussed in terms of grams or ounces.\\nSo an eighth of mushrooms refers to an eighth of an ounce of mushrooms or X number of grams of mushrooms.\\nThe breakdown is actually quite simple.\\n1000 milligrams equals one gram.\\nAnd the concentration of psilocybin in most so-called magic mushrooms is about 1%.\\nSo one gram of mushrooms being 1000 milligrams means that it contains approximately, and again, it's approximately 10 milligrams of psilocybin.\\nAnd then most of the clinical studies, it's been shown that the dosage of 25 to 30 milligrams given, or I should say taken once or twice, we'll talk about the spacing of sessions a little bit later, taken once or twice is what's leading to the most pronounced therapeutic outcomes.\\nBut of course, with enhanced therapeutic outcomes, one also observes enhanced side effect profiles or what are called adverse events.\\nSo there's an important nuanced conversation that has to take place.\\nBut right now we're talking about the conversion of grams of mushrooms to psilocybin.\\nSo one gram of mushrooms being 1000 milligrams containing 1% psilocybin means that it contains 10 milligrams of psilocybin.\\nNow, the so-called heroic doses that you've heard about, and this is something that's discussed more with the, let's call them traditional or classic psychonauts.\\nThese are people that may have an advanced degree, but typically are not running laboratories exploring the effects of psilocybin in controlled clinical trials.\\nThese are people who have been longtime explorers and often writers and people who have been spokespeople for psilocybin and other psychedelics.\\nAnd they will often refer to the so-called heroic doses.\\nIt's a little bit hard to translate from that informal community to the scientific data.\\nBut in discussing that topic with various researchers who run laboratories at major universities focused on psychedelic therapies, what I was told is that the quote unquote heroic dose that's often discussed really refers to a five gram or so dose of mushrooms.\\nSo what that translates to is 50 milligrams of psilocybin.\\nSo when you hear someone talk about a quote unquote heroic dose, they're probably referring to ingestion of 50 milligrams or so of psilocybin, but in its mushroom form.\\nSo about five grams of mushrooms.\\nAnd again, it's important to point out that the concentration of psilocybin in different strains of mushrooms and in different batches, and depending on the age of those mushrooms and how they've been stored, et cetera, can vary tremendously from batch to batch.\\nIn fact, there are some laboratories that have explored the range of psilocybin concentration in different mushroom strains and different so-called magic mushrooms.\\nAnd that range is pretty broad.\\nIt's anywhere from a half percent all the way up to 2%.\\nWhat that means is that someone might get a hold of one gram of mushrooms thinking that they're taking 10 milligrams of psilocybin in those mushrooms when in fact they're actually taking 20.\\nOr somebody could take three grams of mushrooms thinking they're taking 30 grams of psilocybin.\\nAnd in fact, they're only taking 10 or 15 milligrams of psilocybin.\\nSo the sourcing is really key, obviously, as things become more legal and more regulated and more used in the therapeutic setting.\\nOr, and this is what's happening more and more, or as people start to rely on synthetically made psilocybin as opposed to using mushrooms to ingest psilocybin, then certainly the dosaging is going to be more consistent from batch to batch because we're not talking about batches of mushrooms, we're talking about batches of psilocybin itself.\\nSo now I'd like to take a step back from all this chemistry and cell biology and talk a little bit about the structure of a psilocybin journey itself and relate that to what we now know about what's happening in the brain during the psilocybin journey.\\nAnd then a little bit later, we will return to that serotonin 2A receptor when we talk about some of the more lasting changes in brain chemistry and brain wiring that occur after the psilocybin journey is over.\\nSo let's take a couple of minutes and just discuss the various components of an effective therapeutic psilocybin journey.\\nAnd here I'm not detailing a menu of things that people should do in order to pretend that they are a psilocybin assisted therapy coach or to do self-administered psilocybin therapy.\\nThat is not what I'm doing.\\nWhat I am trying to do is to share with you the consistent components that are present in the clinical trials that have demonstrated the effectiveness of psilocybin for the treatment of depression and for other compulsive and addictive disorders.\\nAnd those data, meaning the specific data related to those trials and the references themselves, we'll get into a little bit later.\\nBut we can't really have a conversation about psilocybin and what it does without talking about the so-called set and setting as it's often referred to that is known to at least bias the probability of the journey being beneficial and not a so-called bad trip.\\nSo what are the variables that make up an effective and safe psilocybin journey? And again, when we say safe, we're referring to people who are not prone to psychotic episodes.\\nThey don't even have a first relative that's prone to psychotic episodes.\\nWe're talking about people that are 25 years or older.\\nWe're talking about people that, for instance, are not taking antidepressants that impact the serotonin system.\\nThis is very important to understand.\\nI think a lot of people don't know this, but as far as I know, all of the studies that have explored psilocybin for its ability to positively impact brain chemistry and mood and function have required that people either not be on or abstain from antidepressants in the weeks leading up to the psilocybin journey.\\nNow, that is not to say that if you are currently taking SSRIs or something similar that you should cease taking them and do psilocybin.\\nI'm absolutely not saying that.\\nThat could be very, very, very dangerous if not catastrophic.\\nAnytime you're going to take anything or stop taking anything for that matter, you do need to consult with your physician.\\nLet's get a psychiatrist as well.\\nSo let's talk about psilocybin journeys from the subjective side and from the structural side.\\nAnd when I say the structural side, what I mean is what does a psychedelic journey actually include? And here are the words set and setting become extremely important.\\nSome of you may have heard that set and setting are the foundation of a well-done or even therapeutically beneficial psychedelic journey.\\nAnd all of that really hinges on safety and outcomes.\\nSo set refers to mindset, the mindset of the person taking the psychedelic.\\nAnd setting refers to, as the name suggests, the setting in which they're taking it in and the people that are present there.\\nSo let's talk about setting first.\\nThe setting for a psychedelic journey needs to be one in which the person under the influence of the psilocybin or other psychedelic is safe.\\nThat means no windows they can jump out of.\\nThat means no streets of moving cars they can run out into.\\nThat means no opportunity for getting lost.\\nThat means no opportunity for getting into bodies of water.\\nIn other words, it requires that there be at least one and perhaps even two or more other individuals who are not also taking psychedelics, right? Who are not also taking psychedelics present in that setting to ensure that the person taking the psilocybin is not going to harm themselves or others.\\nI say this not to sound like a school teacher, even though technically I'm a school teacher, but because of course I don't want anyone to get harmed.\\nAnd I'm also aware that there's a lot of interest nowadays in psychedelics such as psilocybin becoming legal or decriminalized for their therapeutic applications.\\nAnd if we look back to the late 1960s and early 1970s, when the Controlled Substances Act was invoked to make psychedelics like psilocybin illegal, one of the bases for that was not just the geopolitical unrest at the time and things like the Vietnam War, but also some highlighted instances in which people did not take set and setting into consideration, took things like LSD, stared at the sun, went blind or took psilocybin, went out and harmed somebody else.\\nAgain, these are very, very isolated instances, but these are the exact sort of instances that lead to criminalization or the fact that things like psilocybin and LSD and MDMA for that matter are considered illegal.\\nAgain, I completely acknowledge that there are a number of different factors making them illegal.\\nWe could have a whole discussion about that.\\nWe talk about the drug trade, the war on drugs, but right now is such a critical time in the history and the use of psychedelics for therapeutic and other reasons and getting setting correct, meaning making it absolutely as safe as possible for the person taking the psychedelic is absolutely key.\\nAnd one of the best ways to ensure that it's safe is to have responsible individuals who are not under the influence of psychedelics present in that environment.\\nSo that's one component of setting.\\nThe other component of setting that we talked about earlier, which turns out to be very important, is the opportunity and perhaps even the bias toward the person on the psychedelic being seated or ideally lying down and being in the eye mask or at least having their eyes covered so that they can combine any spontaneous visual hallucinations that occur with the various thought processes that are occurring while under the influence of psychedelics.\\nThis is far and away different than quote unquote, taking mushrooms and going into the woods or taking mushrooms and going to the beach.\\nWhat we're talking about today is the use of psychedelics for particular brain rewiring outcomes that yes, can involve things like changing one's relationship to nature or changing one's relationship to somebody else by interacting with nature or somebody else.\\nAnd while I'm not trying to diminish the potential value of those sorts of psychedelic journeys, if we look at the scientific data, the vast majority of it, not just in the clinical setting, but in terms of understanding the safety and efficacy and positive rewiring of brain circuitry that allows people to feel better, to understand themselves better and to interact with life in more adaptive ways going forward out of the psychedelic journey involve these very, let's say, subdued settings that are typically in one room, a closed environment with one or two other individuals acting as sort of guides or helping the individual by talking to them from time to time if they feel like they have to sort through a particular aspect of the psychedelic journey that's creating anxiety.\\nAnd we'll talk about the contour of the psychedelic journey that almost everyone who takes psilocybin at somewhere between 20 and 30 milligram dosages tends to experience.\\nBut the setting that I'm describing is not just a list of things to make sure you're safe, but they're really the list of things that also ensure that one can get the maximum benefit out of the psilocybin journey.\\nNow, other things included in setting that are known, again, from scientific literature to be very influential in terms of the experience that one has and to bias things towards a positive experience are, again, safety, eye mask, but also the presence of music.\\nNow, when I first heard about this from one of the premier researchers on psilocybin and other psychedelics, which is Robin Cardart Harris, he's a professor at University of California, San Francisco, who's one of the major pioneers in the studies of psychedelics.\\nAnd when he first started telling me about the critical role that music plays, I thought, okay, that makes sense.\\nThat music can impact our emotion, impact the way that we think, and could therefore impact what one experiences during the psychedelic journey.\\nBut he really underscored for me the extent to which music is not just a sort of incidental feature of the setting in psychedelic set and setting, but that it is one of the major drivers of the actual cognitive and emotional experience that somebody has on something like psilocybin that allows the psilocybin journey to be looked at or viewed, not just as beneficial, but, and this is quoted in the scientific literature, as one of the most profound and important positive experiences that one ever experienced in their life.\\nSo let's talk about the sorts of music that have been used in these clinical studies.\\nWell, first of all, we need to think about how long the psilocybin journey itself is going to be.\\nAnd the typical duration of the psilocybin journey is anywhere from four to six hours.\\nIt's going to depend somewhat on dose.\\nIt's going to depend somewhat on variability in people's liver metabolism.\\nAnd it's also going to depend somewhat on how much food people have in their gut.\\nIn all the clinical studies that I read, it was advised that people not have any food in their gut at the time at which they ingest or injected with the psilocybin.\\nIt's particularly true if people are going to be taking psilocybin mushrooms in order to get their psilocybin.\\nAnd that has been done in a few studies.\\nMost studies, however, use synthetic psilocybin taken orally.\\nAgain, that's converted to psilocin in the gut by the acidity of the gut.\\nAnd the acidity of the gut is going to be impacted by the various foods that people eat.\\nAnd so that's one of the major reasons why people are advised to not eat for at least four hours prior to the psilocybin journey.\\nSo here we've got this six hour, what we're calling journey, because that's what everyone calls it or trip, that people start experiencing about 30 to 45 minutes after ingesting psilocybin or taking psilocybin.\\nThere's a peak component in which there's a maximal intensity of emotion and often that's also associated with anxiety.\\nAnd this is very important to understand.\\nThe anxiety component is part of what in the therapeutic setting they refer to as ego dissolution and that anxiety around the peak.\\nAnd I think most people would probably hear peak experience and think, oh, we're talking about a peak positive experience.\\nBut no, we're referring to a peak experience and anxiety that people stay with and then come down from gradually as one goes from the second or third hour after taking psilocybin.\\nAnd that tapers off slowly toward the six hour mark, what sometimes people refer to as parachuting back in.\\nOf course, they're not, hopefully, I would very much hope people aren't actually parachuting back in while on psilocybin, but I think you get the idea.\\nThe music that's typically played in the clinical studies using psilocybin for the treatment of depression or for compulsive disorders or addiction tends to have a particular contour that matches with and can also drive that contour of the psilocybin journey that I just described.\\nAgain, we're talking about people wearing an eye mask with guides present.\\nSo people who are not taking psilocybin there as well to ensure that the person feels supported and is safe.\\nThe person is typically lying down, sometimes sitting down, but more often than not lying down wearing an eye mask.\\nAnd the music that's played at the beginning of the psilocybin session tends to be music that doesn't have a lot of vocalizations.\\nIt tends to be things like classical music.\\nIt tends to be fairly low volume, but that then transitions into music that has a lot of percussion.\\nSo often drums that tends to be higher volume that has a lot of intensity at about the time that one would be experiencing the peak in emotion and in perception, the so-called peak of the journey.\\nThat intense music tends to be played for about 45 minutes to 90 minutes, depending on the study one looks at.\\nAnd then tends to transition into softer music again, sometimes choral type or more melodic music, often female voices in particular, and then transition into nature sounds and things that more or less mimic the outside natural world and less so synthetic things like drums or instruments and vocalizations and things of that sort.\\nSo why would it be so important that music match and even contribute to the subjective experience that people have on psychedelics? And here we should probably take a couple of moments and just talk about what those subjective experiences are like.\\nSo for people that haven't done psilocybin or any psychedelics, it's a little hard to describe, but one way to describe it is that there's a lot of so-called perceptual blending.\\nSo for instance, people in the eye mask will report seeing some geometric shapes and colors, but perhaps the music they're listening to will then start to change the intensity or the movement of whatever it is that they're seeing, hallucinating inside of the eye mask in ways that are linked.\\nThis is referred to as synesthesia or the merging of different senses that are not ordinarily merged.\\nIn addition, people under the influence of psilocybin or other psychedelics for that matter, often will report that their pattern of breathing becomes linked to the perceptions of things that they are hearing or seeing or feeling.\\nSo for instance, if they take a big deep breath in and then a long exhale out, they may find that during the long exhale out that the notes of music that they're hearing in those moments are also drawn out for the duration of the breath and they'll inhale and that they're getting at least what they perceive as control over the music, which of course they are not actually controlling by using their breath.\\nAnd that perhaps their visual perceptions are also being merged with that.\\nSo those are just a couple of examples of how perceptual blending AKA synesthesia can occur while under the influence of psilocybin.\\nAnd this really is highly individual from one person to the next.\\nSome people, for instance, will find that if they take their fingertips and rub them across the couch or the chair that they happen to be lying down or sitting on, that they will experience a change in the music.\\nMaybe even if they move their hand up, they hear an increase in frequency of sound, they move their hand down, they hear a decrease in frequency of sound and that all of this is linked to their emotional state at the same time and vice versa.\\nOkay, so we're talking about a lot of perceptual and emotional blending and some sense of control over one's perceptions and emotions in a way that's very unordinary, even extraordinary.\\nNow we can step back from all of this very subjective description of the psychedelic journey and ask what is going on that would allow these sorts of things to occur? And there you are already equipped with an understanding of the cell biology and the chemistry that makes all of this possible.\\nAnd that is that when psilocybin is ingested and then converted to psilocin, it's the psilocin that crosses the blood-brain barrier.\\nAnd then even though psilocin looks a lot like serotonin, psilocin has this incredible ability to predominantly activate the serotonin 2A receptor.\\nWell, we can understand much of what's happening at a subjective level during the psychedelic journey, even right down to the sorts of emotions and perceptual blending, the synesthesia.\\nWe can understand a lot of that by understanding where the serotonin 2A receptors are expressed on neurons and what those particular neurons are doing.\\nAnd the simplest way to describe this is that there's a category of neurons that we call pyramidal neurons.\\nPyramidal neurons are found lots of places in the brain, but they're called pyramidal neurons because they're shaped like a pyramid.\\nThey have a cell body, which is the part of the cell that has the DNA in it and a lot of other important things like the organelles, mitochondria, et cetera.\\nAnd then they also have what are called dendrites.\\nDendrites are the little branches or processes that reach out both from the bottom of these cells.\\nAnd then these pyramidal cells are interesting because they also grow a branch up, up, up, up, up into layers of neural tissue above them.\\nAnd they have what's called an apical branch.\\nThat's the part that grows up.\\nAnd then they fan out at the top.\\nAnd that fanning out at the top allows them to communicate with other neurons in their environment.\\nOkay, so if you're not getting a good picture of this in your mind from my description, I apologize, but simply think about putting your arms out to the side.\\nAnd by doing that, you're able to interact with things that are some distance from your body.\\nSort of an obvious thing in that case.\\nThese cells are effectively doing the same thing by extending little processes out into layers above them and to the sides.\\nAnd this is really important because much of the serotonin 2A receptors that are present on neurons in the brain are present in those apical dendrites, those branches of these pyramidal neurons that are above and that extend out to the side of those neurons.\\nAnd so when somebody is under the influence of psilocybin, that means that psilocin has bound to the receptors on those apical dendrites, and it's increasing lateral communication across brain areas.\\nIn fact, this is perhaps one of the most well-documented effects of psilocybin and other psychedelics, which is that there's a shift from the brain being more modular, meaning more segmented, like auditory neurons are communicating electrically and chemically largely with other auditory neurons.\\nOf course, they'll communicate with other types of neurons too, right? When I hear something off to my right, like a snap of the fingers off the right, I'll turn my head and my ability to do that depends on my auditory neurons being linked up with things like my motor system and my visual system.\\nBut the key thing to understand is that when there is psilocybin present in one system, that the communication of any of these pyramidal neurons, the ones involved in hearing, the ones involved in thinking, the ones involved in memory, the ones involved in visual perception or in the generation of visual hallucinations with eyes closed, those are all talking to many, many more other neurons more extensively.\\nSo what happens effectively is that there's a reduction in the modularity, the separateness of function in the brain, and an increase in what's called integration of communication across what would otherwise be disparate brain regions.\\nWe can say that really simply by saying psilocybin increases communication across the brain.\\nNow, in addition to that, there's a reduction in what's called the hierarchical organization of the brain.\\nTypically, sensory information comes in from the outside environment.\\nSo we hear something, we see something, we taste something, we smell something.\\nAnd in what's called a bottom up fashion, meaning bottom from the periphery, up meaning it propagates up through the eyes, through the nose, through the ears, through the skin or the senses in those regions, I should say, up into areas of the brain that sit deep to the cortex like the thalamus.\\nAnd then the thalamus is sort of a way station.\\nIt's like a switchboard that sends visual stuff to the visual centers and auditory stuff to the auditory centers and touch stuff to the touch centers and things that maybe trigger a memory off to the memory centers of the brain, et cetera.\\nThat's the typical organization.\\nIt's hierarchical because it goes from the periphery up to the more complex processing regions of the brain that make decisions, that link all of that stuff to prior experience, maybe plans about the future.\\nWhen psilocybin is present in the system, there's a broadening of the flow of that information from the bottom up as well.\\nAnd that has to do with what's called thalamic gating.\\nThe thalamus is a very interesting structure.\\nWe probably don't want to go into it in too much detail right now, but it really is like a switchboard and a way station saying, hey, pay attention to the visual stuff.\\nPay attention to the auditory stuff or just to the visual and auditory stuff and ignore touch sensation for the time being or vice versa.\\nWhen psilocybin is present in the system and when serotonin 2A receptors are activated very strongly, there's a tremendous broadening of the flow of information up and through the thalamus.\\nSo not only is there more communication of so-called higher order brain centers, we refer to them as higher order because they're involved in thinking and decision making and emotion, et cetera, but there's also a shift in the flow of sensory information into the brain that can generally be described as broader and including more blending of the different senses.\\nAnd when I say blending of the senses, I'm also referring to blending of the sense of interoception, of our sense of our body and what's happening inside of our body.\\nAnd this without question, at least partially explains why when under the influence of psilocybin, one's breathing can be linked to a sound and then suddenly the sound one thinks is being controlled by one's breathing or that the sound itself can be linked to something that we see in our mind's eye while in the eye mask.\\nEssentially what I'm describing here is that serotonin 2A receptor activation allows for more broad, less precise and less hierarchical activation of brain circuitry.\\nAnd when I say hierarchical, what I mean is that normally things go from periphery, from eyes to thalamus to visual cortex.\\nHowever, when under the influence of psilocybin, as I mentioned before, even in the eye mask, the visual cortex is going to be very activated even in the absence of any visual input.\\nSo then if one hears a sound, perhaps from music, a particular motif or voice, and that's linked to a particular emotional state, that is now being blended with visual phenomenon occurring within the brain that have no external stimulus.\\nAnd so while the patterns of activation in the brain while under the influence of psilocybin aren't random, they are far less channeled, far less modular and far less hierarchical than would ever be the case when not under the influence of psilocybin.\\nI'd like to just take a brief break and thank one of our sponsors, which is Element.\\nElement is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't.\\nThat means plenty of salt, sodium, magnesium and potassium, the so-called electrolytes and no sugar.\\nNow, salt, magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body, in particular to the function of your nerve cells, also called neurons.\\nAnd we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.\\nElement contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio of 1,000 milligrams, that's one gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium and 60 milligrams of magnesium.\\nI typically drink Element first thing in the morning when I wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure I have enough electrolytes.\\nAnd while I do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well, especially if I've been sweating a lot, and certainly I drink Element in my water when I'm in the sauna and after going in the sauna because that causes quite a lot of sweating.\\nIf you'd like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement, that's lmnt.com slash Huberman to claim a free Element sample pack with your

networks are most activated during a psilocybin or other psychedelic journey.\\nAnd so for those of you that are interested in those different models, first of all, please know that they are not competing models.\\nWhile some of them disagree about some of the details, it's very likely that all of these models are true.\\nThey include things like changes in the so-called default mode network.\\nThere's a lot of interest in this.\\nI've talked about it before on this podcast.\\nThe default mode network is the network in the brain that's thought to be responsible for spontaneous imagination, for daydreaming, and that reflects sort of the base activation state of the brain when there's no drugs in our system.\\nAnd the default mode network is one of the systems or networks rather, that is thought to be rewired under conditions of psilocybin or other psychedelics.\\nAgain, if you're interested in these models and comparing and contrasting them, there's a very nice review from Brian Roth's lab at Duke entitled The Neural Basis of Psychedelic Action.\\nWe'll provide a link to this in the show note captions.\\nAnd again, I just want to emphasize that all of these models have been shown to be true in different studies.\\nAnd what they all point to is more extensive communication between areas of the brain that normally are not as active at the same time while under the influence of psychedelics such as psilocybin.\\nThe controversy in the field relates to which of these networks is the one that changes the most to explain the therapeutic outcomes that have been discovered in recent years.\\nSo again, check out that review if you're interested in that sort of thing.\\nIn the meantime, we can cut a broad swath through all of those models and just say that psilocybin expands the functional connectivity of the brain while one is under the influence of psilocybin.\\nAnd it does seem that some of that expanded functional connectivity persists after the effects of psilocybin have worn off.\\nAnd that statement about the functional connectivity of the brain being more expanded, not just during the psilocybin session, but after as well, has been substantiated in a number of papers.\\nBut one of the key papers in this area is one that I recommend people check out if they're interested in this sort of thing, is entitled the effects of psilocybin and MDMA on between network resting state functional connectivity in healthy volunteers.\\nAnd I like this paper for a number of reasons.\\nFirst of all, it's a very high quality paper carried out in the laboratory of Robin Cardart Harris at UCSF.\\nAgain, one of the premier researchers in this area of psychedelics and their function, what they do in the brain and also their therapeutic applications, but also because it focused on healthy volunteers.\\nThey explored using brain imaging, what brain areas are active in a resting state.\\nSo things like default mode network.\\nThen they had people take psilocybin or MDMA.\\nAnd then they looked at the connectivity between those brain areas in those same individuals when they were not under the influence of these drugs and found more extensive connectivity.\\nAll of which pointed to an enhanced lateral connectivity, less hierarchical organization, effectively more interconnection and communication between different brain areas.\\nI think not only is the fact that they looked at healthy volunteers, very interesting and important, but also that they looked at this resting state of the brain.\\nThey weren't providing a particular auditory or visual stimulus for people to hear or look at while they were in the brain imaging scanner, as it's called.\\nRather, they were simply looking at how the brain was behaving at rest.\\nAnd so it's very clear that for people that do two or even just one of these psilocybin journeys at a particular dose, that the brain is actually getting rewired.\\nYou know, we hear this a lot.\\nPsilocybin or other psychedelics lead to plasticity.\\nThey rewire your brain.\\nWell, let's go back to what we said at the beginning.\\nRewiring of the brain is not the goal.\\nAdaptive rewiring of the brain is the goal, right? Rewiring that leads to new ideas that are interesting, that are accessible after the psychedelic journey, new ideas and new ways of thinking or feeling that allow people to function better in their lives.\\nThat's the goal of effective psychedelic therapies, not simply rewiring of the brain.\\nA brain injury for that matter will lead to rewiring of the brain, but that's maladaptive rewiring.\\nThe use of things like amphetamines or methamphetamines in particular will lead to rewiring of the brain, but that is strongly maladaptive rewiring.\\nSo now there are really dozens of studies conducted in humans using brain imaging and other techniques have evaluated how things like psilocybin change connectivity in the brain.\\nAnd I think the take-home message is it expands that connectivity.\\nHowever, it seems to do so in ways that still allow people to function in their daily lives.\\nAnd one of the key things that I gleaned from the literature on the therapeutic use of psilocybin for the treatment of depression is that very seldom do people who take psilocybin experience long-term issues with memory.\\nWhy is that so critical? Well, you could imagine that increasing connectivity in the brain, reducing modularity, reducing hierarchical organization of the brain would lead to disruptions in memory, right? It's as if you're shuffling books on the bookshelf, so to speak, but that doesn't seem to be the case.\\nRather, it seems that the increase in connectivity is leading, provided set and setting are correct, provided safety protocols are followed to positive rewiring or adaptive rewiring of neural tissue.\\nSo that's one of the things that makes psychedelics and psilocybin in particular very exciting from the therapeutic standpoint.\\nAnd of course, we have to acknowledge that it's also what has a lot of people excited about psychedelics, not just for the treatment of depression, but for expanding the brain's capabilities more generally.\\nSo along those lines, I want to touch on the issues of creativity and the experience of life outside of psychedelic journeys is impacted by psychedelic journeys.\\nAnd here, this relates to a question that I heard a lot when I put the call out on social media that I was going to do this episode, and I asked people, what do you want to know about psilocybin? And one of the more common questions that I got was, does it increase creativity? Does it increase our experience of life in ways that are beneficial aside from it's now documented positive effects in treating depression and compulsive disorders and addiction? And the short answer to this is yes, but that the positive effects of psychedelics, psilocybin in particular on creativity and our experience of life have only been explored in a fairly narrow set of dimensions.\\nHowever, where it's been explored, there's some really interesting findings.\\nSo one of the more interesting findings I think is a paper entitled increased low frequency brain responses to music after psilocybin therapy for depression.\\nI think this is a really interesting paper because what the authors did is they took advantage of the fact that in these therapeutic psilocybin sessions that are carried out for the treatment of depression, music is being played.\\nAnd there are prior studies showing that when music is played, you activate different brain areas depending on what sort of music is being played.\\nThat's somewhat obvious, perhaps, sad music versus intense, you could think about heavy metal versus choir music versus Gregorian chants versus punk rock music and on and on.\\nIt makes sense that different brain areas would be activated when different patterns of music are played.\\nHowever, there do seem to be some universal features of brain activation in response to music.\\nThis should probably be the topic of an entire episode of the Huberman Lab podcast and indeed it will be.\\nFor instance, there are areas of the auditory cortex that are activated, no surprise there, and areas of the brain's reward circuitry, the so-called ventral striatum and the so-called mesolimbic reward pathway.\\nTalked a lot about these in the episodes about dopamine that I've done previously.\\nThese are brain areas that lead to the release of dopamine in other brain areas and that reinforce certain experiences and that tend to give us the subjective feeling of, yes, I like this, I want more.\\nSo in this particular paper, what the authors did is they took advantage of the fact that people are in the clinic, they're on psilocybin, they're listening to music and as you recall, the music played at different stages of the psilocybin journey are different.\\nThey have a different emotional component and music is a really nice stimulus in the laboratory as we say, because like with visual stimuli, you can break it down into high-frequency, low-frequency.\\nSounds like doon, doon or these kinds of things.\\nThat was my attempt at low frequency versus high frequency auditory stimuli or at the spatial frequency or what in the auditory domain would be called the temporal frequency.\\nIs it boom, boom, boom or is it boom, boom, boom, boom? All we've changed there is the temporal frequency.\\nThe sound was somewhat the same but the distance between those sounds was different.\\nYou get the idea.\\nSo they have access to these people and these different conditions and they can put them in the brain scanner and they can do that before and after having taken psilocybin.\\nAnd the long and short of this study is that psilocybin changes one's experience of music, not just during the psilocybin journey itself but thereafter.\\nAnd in fact, it changes one's emotional response to music in very interesting ways.\\nFor instance, one of the more common features of major depression is that people don't derive as much pleasure from different types of experiences whether or not it's food or sex or social experiences to the point where sometimes they just stop trying to seek out those experiences.\\nPeople with depression often feel as if music no longer has the same impact.\\nIt just doesn't really lift them up very much.\\nThis study found that people who have taken psilocybin according to the parameters we talked about earlier can get a return of the elevated emotionality, the positive emotions associated with music that formerly made them feel good.\\nIn other words, they can feel music again.\\nThey can feel good in response to music again.\\nNow, this is interesting because in theory, it could be that psilocybin simply allowed them to access the emotions around music again more generally but that's actually not what this paper and some other papers that have been published report.\\nRather, it seems that taking psilocybin can increase one's positive perception of music that one likes and can tone down or reduce the depressiveness or the sadness of music that tends to make one sad even after the psilocybin has worn off and for a long period of time afterwards, maybe even forever, although no study, of course, can be carried out forever because forever is forever.\\nWhat we do know, however, is that psilocybin can rewire the connections between the emotion centers in the brain and the networks that control auditory perception of music and leads to this condition in which people who felt like I was depressed or I couldn't feel the music, I just wasn't getting the same lift and joy from it again, they can start to experience more joy from that music again and that music that made them feel sad and depressed has a diminished capacity to make them feel sad and depressed.\\nAnd there's a lot of neuroimaging data in this paper that point to the specific brain areas that include areas like the ventral tegmental area that can explain why these sorts of effects would occur.\\nSo this isn't just subjective reports of people saying, oh yeah, I was depressed and music didn't feel really good and now it feels great or that used to make me feel so sad and now I feel like I have a capacity to listen to that without being crushed by feelings of sadness.\\nThe paper included some subjective reports of that sort, but then was able to link those to changes in brain circuitry and brain activation in response to music using neuroimaging.\\nSo in that way, it really points to both the subjective and structural and functional changes that psilocybin can bring about through that expanded connectivity between brain areas.\\nBecause remember, during the psilocybin session, it's not as if music or the perception of music is specifically being looked at or focused on in these studies, rather music is playing, people are in the eye mask, they're feeling all sorts of things, they're breathing, they're hearing, they're touch, it's all happening all at once.\\nThere's a peak, it's long, there's a long taper, the music's changing.\\nOkay, all of that took place in this study as well.\\nBut it is after the session when comparing brain activation states to music of a particular type, sad or happy, and comparing that to the patterns of brain activation that occurred before the psilocybin journey that they discover that people's brains have rewired during the psilocybin session in a way that allows them to experience joy in response to music again.\\nSo that's one of the more rigorous studies I was able to find that addresses this question of whether or not psilocybin really does rewire the brain in ways that allows us to be more creative and experience life differently after the psilocybin session.\\nNow that paper didn't focus specifically on creativity.\\nI did an entire episode on creativity that talked about different types of meditation, like open monitoring meditation, it talked about different patterns of thinking that one can actually practice to increase creativity.\\nWe had arguably one of the most creative people on the planet, Rick Rubin came on this podcast, talked about the creative process from the perspective of music and his role in producing music.\\nSo you can check out those episodes if you're interested in the neural circuitry related to creativity.\\nAt least at the time of recording this episode, there haven't been a lot of studies looking specifically at the brain networks that we think are involved in creativity and how those change in response to psilocybin and other psychedelics.\\nI imagine those studies are either happening now or will happen in the future.\\nBut the studies I just described, referring to the changes in emotionality and responses to music, I think provide a nice template for what's likely happening both during psilocybin journeys and after those psilocybin journeys.\\nWhen we talk about less hierarchical organization, more connectivity between brain areas, what it's pointing to is the fact that during the psilocybin journey, people have the opportunity to learn new relationships between different sensory and emotional states.\\nAnd those new relationships seem to persist long after the psychedelic journey has been finished.\\nAnd a lot of people researching psilocybin in the clinical setting think that that's one of the major reasons why psilocybin and other psychedelics can rewire our relationship to things more broadly.\\nIt allows for new learning, new contingencies.\\nAnd when we look at depression, we often think, you know, diminished mood, people now have an appetite, they're not interested in social relationships or romantic relationships, they're really struggling.\\nAnd all of that, of course, is true.\\nBut another lens to look at depression through is that a lot of that thinking and a lot of those emotional states that are negative are somewhat habitual.\\nThey relate to a sort of implicit understanding and living out of the idea that A leads to B leads to C.\\nOkay, you seek out a relationship, it doesn't work out.\\nYou try a new job, you don't get the job.\\nYou get the job, it's no good.\\nAll these negative outcomes of if A, then B, then C.\\nAnd it does seem that psilocybin can have this effect of invoking new patterns of learning, new considerations about what might be possible.\\nAnd indeed may even lead to actual rewiring of the emotion centers in the brain with these other brain areas and vice versa in ways that eject people from the psilocybin session, thinking, oh, you know, yeah, I used to feel this way about something, work, relationships, myself, et cetera, but I'm willing to consider this other possibility or this other possibility seems at least partially true to the extent that I'm willing to go out and evaluate that.\\nNow, here I'm speaking very subjectively, but remember we have to tie back the subjective experiences and changes of things like music and emotion and our relationship to life and jobs and relationships back to the cell biology and chemistry of psilocybin because ultimately it really is just a chemical activating receptors, those receptors changing networks in the brain.\\nAnd the journey itself seems to be the time when all of those changes are put in motion.\\nIt's like a boulder that gets rolling.\\nIn fact, I think the best way to think about psilocybin and other psychedelics is that they initiate the neuroplasticity process, but they are not the neuroplasticity process itself.\\nAnd the journey itself is not where all the neuroplasticity occurs.\\nWe know that for sure.\\nIn fact, if you want to imagine how psilocybin and other psychedelics work to change the brain, think about them as a wedge that gets underneath the boulder that is the neuroplasticity that gets rolling forward.\\nAnd then think about whether or not the plasticity is adaptive or maladaptive, whether or not it actually serves you in your life on a daily basis or not, depending on whether or not you're using your conscious brain to move that boulder in a particular direction, right? Not just bulldozing through things and destroying them, but clearing a path through old, ineffective, maybe even destructive patterns of thoughts or emotions, et cetera.\\nI give you that analogy because I think it more accurately captures what psychedelics like psilocybin are doing, rather than the typical discussion around psychedelics that we tend to hear, which is that, oh, it creates plasticity and plasticity is what you want.\\nFor the next couple of minutes, I'd like to focus on some of the key and stereotype that is characteristic experiences that people tend to have during a psilocybin journey, because there's some really interesting research on this.\\nThese are phrases that perhaps you've heard before, things like letting go, ego dissolution, feelings of connectedness.\\nWhile all of that is very subjective on the one hand, those words are heard often enough and repeatedly enough in psilocybin sessions and after psilocybin sessions, along with this description of the psilocybin experience as one of the most profound of one's life, or one of the most positive in the ideal case of one's life, that they are worth exploring.\\nWe should also, of course, explore the so-called bad trip, the possibility that someone will have a not good time or even very frightening time while under the influence of psilocybin.\\nSo there have been some scientific studies that have explored what sorts of subjective experiences, that is thoughts and feelings, insights that people have that relate to positive therapeutic outcomes.\\nAnd more generally with the sense that the psilocybin journey was positive or maybe even tremendously positive in one's life.\\nSo while there's a century or more of writings about psychedelics that describe things like enhanced feelings of connectedness or dissolution of the ego, the loss of one sense of self, and then the regaining of one sense of self and so on.\\nThere is a particular paper that describes some of those things in terms of rating scales, that is the sorts of tests that people can take in which they answer particular questions and that link back to things like feelings of connectedness and ego dissolution that allows us to put some numbers to those experiences and to look at some of the statistics associated with those experiences.\\nAnd this is really what's important about scientific studies, whether or not a measure is subjective, so someone's self-reporting how they felt or feel, or whether or not it's measure of blood pressure or of a chemical in the bloodstream, et cetera.\\nIt's the use of numbers and statistics that allows comparison between different groups and that can be compared between studies that allows us to make some firm conclusions about what sorts of things psilocybin may or may not be doing when it's effective or not.\\nSo the paper I'd like to highlight is entitled, Quality of Acute Psychedelic Experience Predicts Therapeutic Efficacy of Psilocybin for Treatment-Resistant Depression.\\nI'll put a link to this paper in the show note captions.\\nBut the basic contour of this paper is that they looked at subjects that underwent two different psilocybin sessions, one at a relatively low-ish dose of 10 milligrams of psilocybin, and that would be equivalent to about one gram of psychedelic mushrooms, more or less.\\nAnd a second session involving subjects taking 25 milligrams of psilocybin, or what's roughly equivalent to somebody taking two and a half grams of psilocybin mushrooms.\\nThose people then answered what's called the Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire, which allowed them to address, and here I'm paraphrasing, the quality of experiences in the 25 milligrams psilocybin session.\\nSo without going into too much detail, it's often the case in these sorts of two-session studies that subjects will take a slightly lower dose of psilocybin to familiarize themselves with the experience, and then the higher dose that leads to the more intense experience, intense meaning a bigger, more intense peak, a longer session overall, greater distortions in emotionality and perceptual experience, all the stuff we talked about before.\\nSo what this study found is that one of the key features, if not the key feature, of a positive, quote unquote, psychedelic experience is this sense of oceanic boundlessness occurring at some point during the psychedelic journey.\\nNow, oceanic boundlessness doesn't necessarily mean anything to any of us.\\nIt probably means different things to different people.\\nIt's this idea that one is experiencing something extremely unusual, even mystical, kind of beyond this world and one's normal experience, but that it's not aligned with any specific outcome in the moment.\\nIt's not directly attached to any one feeling or memory or thought process.\\nIt's this, I think it's a little bit tough to describe because I can guarantee you, I'm not on psilocybin or any psychedelics right now, and I can only imagine that you're not, although some of you might be.\\nI can't even imagine what this podcast would be like for somebody on psilocybin at this moment, but in any case, oceanic boundlessness, a feeling of the experience being mystical and not really heading in any one particular direction, just a feeling of massive connectedness with one's environment, both in the room and session, perhaps with the guides, with oneself, with one's past, with one's present, people outside the room, with the entire world, maybe even the universe, that sort of thing.\\nThe intensity of that experience of oceanic boundlessness, the mystical experience seems to be positively correlated with positive therapeutic outcomes, that is relief from major depression.\\nNow, during the psychedelic journey, as we talked about before, there are a number of steps that one typically goes through.\\nSo there's the buildup to first experiencing the effects of the drug, about maybe 20 to 45 minutes into the journey or trip, then the peak, and it is during that peak that people often feel the sense of oceanic boundlessness.\\nHowever, it's also often the case that it is during the peak, where the maximum intensity of emotion, and we know based on direct measurements, also increases in blood pressure and heart rate, often very significant increases in anxiety and fear as well, that people will experience things like ego dissolution.\\nAnd the guide's role at that point is of course to keep the person safe, make sure they don't run out of the room, jump out of a window, run into traffic.\\nSadly, these are things that have happened outside of a strong, healthy, safe set and setting.\\nBut the guide's role is to keep the person safe, but also to encourage them to let go and move through that experience, to experience the anxiety, allow it to peak, allow them to see that they're not going to die from that anxiety, they're not going to dissolve, they won't lose their sense of self completely, or they may temporarily feel as if they lose their sense of self, but then they feel it restored at various intervals during the peak or as they exit that peak and move toward the, say, second, third, fourth, fifth hour of the session.\\nSo when exactly these feelings of oceanic boundlessness and ego dissolution occur, varies from person to person, but typically it's during the peak that the ego dissolution, the fear and the need to quote unquote let go is most typical.\\nI think perhaps the best way to describe the data in this paper in a way that's meaningful to everybody is to refer you to figure two, which if you're not looking at the paper, won't mean anything to you, but I'll describe it.\\nAnd if you do want to take a look at figure two, again, you can access the paper in the show note captions.\\nWhat they did is they looked at a number of different subjective measures, things like experience of unity, the feeling that one is connected to others and to the world, things like spirituality, whether or not the whole thing felt like a spiritual experience, whether or not it was a blissful state, whether or not there were insights, whether or not somebody felt disembodied, out of body, whether or not somebody had a lot of anxiety, whether or not they had these synesthesias, these blending of visual auditory touch and breathing and things of that sort.\\nAnd they addressed which of those measures related to the positive clinical outcomes that were observed later after the psilocybin wore off.\\nAnd while I'm not going to go point by point through each one of these measures, there's a general feature to emerge from the study, which is that the experience of unity, the sense that the psilocybin journey was spiritual, an experience of bliss at some point inside of the psilocybin journey, the sense that there were insights, that there were learnings about one's life and oneself.\\nWhen those things were experienced very strongly, that correlated with the person being what was called a responder to the psilocybin treatment, meaning they got relief from their depression.\\nWhereas people who felt less of that, okay? So the non-responders, as they're called, the people who do not benefit so much in the long run from the psilocybin treatment tended to report less of an experience of unity, less of a spiritual experience, less of a blissful state, less insightfulness, and so on.\\nWhereas there were very few differences between the people that derived benefit from the psilocybin treatment and those did not along the dimensions of synesthesia, this blending of different perceptions that ordinarily doesn't occur for most people.\\nOr complex imagery, right? Put simply, everyone who took psilocybin in this study at 25 milligrams saw complex imagery.\\nThey saw a lot of hallucinations, but just seeing hallucinations did not lead to the positive clinical outcomes in terms of mood.\\nAnxiety was a very interesting measure here because ordinarily we think of the ego dissolution, the letting go is such a key component of the psychedelic journey in terms of the positive therapeutic outcomes.\\nThis has been discussed quite a lot.\\nAnd in full disclosure, Robin Carter Harris has already come on to record an episode of the Huberman Lab podcast.\\nThat episode hasn't been released yet, but it will be released soon.\\nAnd he talks about the importance of this letting go in terms of the positive clinical outcomes of the psilocybin journey.\\nAnd indeed that is true.\\nAnd I should also mention that Dr. Matthew Johnson from Johns Hopkins who also runs a laboratory exploring psychedelics and their role in treating things like eating disorders and depression, et cetera, also doing incredible work.\\nAlso talked about the importance of letting go during the psilocybin journey, this ego dissolution, this ability to move through the anxiety.\\nAnd again, I can't underscore this enough because it's been told to me over and over again by the top researchers in this area that people will head into that peaking phase of the psilocybin journey.\\nAnd oftentimes it is not pleasant for them.\\nThey're feeling like it's uncomfortable.\\nIt's scary and their heart rate is up and their blood pressure is up and they're having a hard time calming down than they want to calm down.\\nBut it does seem that while the guides should not ramp them up and get them more stressed, that the ability to move through that stressful period to somewhat guide oneself or to be encouraged to guide oneself through that peak and that anxiety and that fear of losing oneself and the so-called ego dissolution that occurs is an important feature for an effective therapeutic session.\\nIn this study, anxiety itself was inversely correlated with a positive therapeutic outcome.\\nOkay, so this is important and somewhat nuanced.\\nOn the one hand, I'm telling you that the letting go, the ego dissolution does seem to be important in terms of reporting a psychedelic experience as effective as having accomplished something and perhaps even explaining some of the long-term positive effects to emerge from that psychedelic journey, in this case, psilocybin journey.\\nHowever, non-responders, that is people who did psilocybin but did not have a positive therapeutic outcome in comparison to the responders, those non-responders tended to have higher subjective ratings of anxiety than did the responders.\\nSo this is important.\\nAnd what it speaks to is the fact that, well, yes, letting go during the session, experiencing some anxiety, perhaps even ego dissolution and the dissolving of self and then the return of self is important.\\nIt is also important, it seems, that anxiety not be so, so high or subjectively experienced as so high that one does not experience the positive neuronal rewiring that leads to a more pervasive elevated mood.\\nOkay, so I'm definitely saying two things at once because I'm trying to capture the data accurately.\\nIt would not be fair for me to say, just let go, experience as much anxiety as is possible.\\nAnd that's part of the process.\\nYes, letting go, again, an air quote seems to be important for one's experience of the psychedelic journey in particular around the peak that occurs about two hours in or so.\\nHowever, extreme levels of anxiety seem inversely correlated or negatively correlated, would be the better way to put it, with the positive therapeutic outcome or relief from depression.\\nSo this takes us back to all of the things we've been talking about thus far, not just the chemistry and biological action of psilocybin, but the key importance of getting dosage right, the key importance of making sure that you're in a safe environment, but also one in which the guides really know what they're doing.\\nI think this is one of the biggest and most important reasons for having well-trained guides who really understand the contour of the psychedelic journey, but are also trained in how to help somebody with their anxiety in real time while they're under the effects of psilocybin.\\nAnd of course, to help people integrate those feelings of high anxiety and maybe guide them back down to a calmer state during the psychedelic session itself.\\nAnd here I can just mention some unpublished data and studies.\\nAnd again, these are very preliminary, but through discussions with Dr. Matthew Johnson, who's running these psilocybin and other sorts of psychedelic trials at Johns Hopkins, he and I discussed the importance of having a real-time tool to adjust anxiety while under the influence of psychedelics like psilocybin.\\nAnd there he asked, and they've started to incorporate, is my understanding, some of the real-time respiration tools, that is breathing tools, that we know based on work in my laboratory, Dr. David Spiegel's laboratory, can reduce anxiety very quickly in real time.\\nAnd that involves the use of the so-called physiological psi.\\nI've talked a lot about this before on previous podcasts.\\nSo rather than explain it to you again here now, we'll put a link to the physiological psi.\\nI do a demonstration of it in the show note captions.\\nI'll also link to a recent paper that we published in Cell Reports Medicine.\\nThis was a collaborative work that my laboratory did with Dr. David Spiegel's laboratory at Stanford School of Medicine, showing that the physiological size, among the different deliberate respiration techniques, one of the fastest and most effective ways to reduce levels of autonomic arousal, AKA anxiety or stress.\\nAnd Dr. Matthew Johnson's laboratory started to incorporate physiological size within these psychedelic sessions as a tool that the guides can refer people to before the session begins, teaching it to them, so they realize they can calm themselves down if necessary in real time.\\nIt works the first time, it works every time.\\nThis is not because it's some magic breathing technique that I created, it certainly is not.\\nThis is a naturally occurring pattern of breathing that occurs in sleep and in waking, but that when done deliberately leads to very rapid and quite significant decreases in stress and anxiety.\\nAnd then when people are inside of the psychedelic session, if they feel their anxiety levels are going too high, they're heading toward what might be called a quote unquote bad trip.\\nThey're starting to panic, or really think they're going to have a panic attack or die.\\nAgain, the subjective experience is going to be layered on top of the physiological experience of one's heart rate being really elevated, so stress and agitation.\\nBy using the physiological sigh inside of the psychedelic session, Dr. Johnson's laboratory, and I believe at least one other laboratory are starting to use breathing techniques such as the physiological sigh as a way for these people who are under the influence of psilocybin to self-direct their own calm, and to bring that level of anxiety down so that they can continue to move through the peak and move through the other phases of the psychedelic journey in ways that could be most beneficial for them.\\nSo to close out the description of this really wonderful study, and by the way, it's another one from the Cardhart-Harris Laboratory about the subjective experience of ego dissolution or oceanic boundlessness, this mystical state, as so key as a component of a positive psilocybin journey.\\nI'll just read for you the final sentence of this paper because it captures it so well.\\nQuote, it seems vital that appropriate consideration is paid to the importance of promoting a certain kind of experience as the quality of that experience may be the critical determinant of therapeutic success.\\nNow, before we move into what will be a very brief description of some of the other rewiring phenomena that psilocybin can induce, and then into some of the therapeutic applications of psilocybin as they relate to these recent, really exciting clinical trials for depression and addictive disorders and things of that sort, I just want to cue everybody to a paper that I think many people will want to take a look at in thinking about psilocybin, and I'll provide a link to this paper as well in the show note captions.\\nThis paper is entitled Therapeutic Use of Psilocybin, Practical Considerations for Dosing and Administration.\\nAnd this is a wonderful paper because it really goes step by step through the pharmacology of psilocybin, of which you now understand a bit, but it goes into a bit more detail.\\nBut then it also really nicely describes the contour of a psilocybin session and what's happening at the level of chemistry, early, middle, peak, and toward the end of the psilocybin session.\\nAnd then also importantly, it gets into issues of dosage and translating from mushrooms to psilocybin itself to psilocin, things I talked about earlier, but in a bit more detail, if you'd like to see that detail.\\nAnd then perhaps most importantly, there's a section on contraindications where it points out that of course, women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, people who have a predisposition to psychosis, those people should really avoid the use of psilocybin and other psychedelics entirely.\\nIt also talks about where the evidence is strong, moderate, and weak for the use of psilocybin for treatment of various disorders.\\nAnd I can just summarize that very quickly because it's where we're going ahead in a few minutes, which is that the most evidence for positive therapeutic outcomes in response to psilocybin taken and conducted in the manner that we've been describing today in terms of dosage and journey set and setting is for cancer-related depression, cancer-related anxiety, and treatment-resistant depression.\\nThat's where most of the evidence resides.\\nThere's also some evidence for the use of psilocybin journeys.\\nAnd again, this is typically one or two psilocybin journeys spaced in the cases of two journeys, anywhere from one to two weeks apart.\\nAnd again, with all of the same contour of supports and setting that we've been talking about today.\\nAnd there, there's some evidence for improvement in terms of outcomes in alcohol use disorder independence and tobacco addiction.\\nAnd then finally, there's the least amount of evidence, although there is clinical trial support for relief or partial relief, for obsessive-compulsive disorder, cluster headaches and migraines, and demoralization due to AIDS diagnosis, okay? So this paper has a lot of really interesting information in terms of different conditions, in terms of dosage, and again, contra-intigrations and what's called adverse events, what sorts of bad things can and do happen as a consequence of psilocybin and other types of psychedelic journeys, both during and after those psilocybin or psychedelic sessions.\\nAnd we'll talk a bit more about this when we go into some of those clinical studies, because adverse reactions is always a key measure in any clinical study.\\nSo very soon we'll get into the more recent clinical studies related to psilocybin for the use of treating depression and some other conditions.\\nBut before we do that, I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about how psilocybin does and does not change the brain, what is and what is not known about that.\\nIn fact, when I put out the call for questions about psilocybin, many of the questions related to these issues.\\nThe first thing to understand is that a psilocybin journey is really a way to try and put that wedge under the boulder, as I described it, to try and invoke neuroplasticity of a particular kind.\\nAnd in that way, it's kind of remarkable, if you think about it, that everyone has different lives, different experiences.\\nPsychedelics, in this case, psilocybin, are activating these brain networks that each of us has, more broadly than they would normally be activated.\\nThese are very abnormal patterns of thinking and perceiving and experiencing our emotional and physical life, et cetera.\\nAnd yet, so often, the outcomes are positive, not always, but the outcomes are positive, the experience is positive, even though it might have these anxiety moments or components within them.\\nIt's very important to understand that psilocybin and the journey, while important, are not really what all of this is about.\\nIt's really about neuroplasticity.\\nSo researchers, in particular neuroscientists, are very intensely interested in understanding what sorts of neuroplasticity psilocybin creates, because it turns out there are lots of different types or processes involved with neuroplasticity.\\nFor instance, brain networks, behavior, thinking, emotion, et cetera, can change because of the addition of new neurons.\\nThat's one form of neuroplasticity that's referred to as neurogenesis, the production of new neurons, most typically in the so-called dentate gyrus or other subregions of the hippocampus, a brain area involved in learning and memory.\\nNeurogenesis in other regions of the adult human brain are exceedingly rare and, to be honest, may not occur at all.\\nThis is a debated area.\\nWe could do an entire episode about this, but for the most part, neuroscientists don't really believe that your neocortex, your striatum, your cerebellum, has that much neurogenesis that's related to learning and memory of new things or new experiences.\\nAnd we don't actually think that occurs as a consequence of taking psilocybin either.\\nNow, some of you who are familiar with, for instance, the cerebellum might be saying, wait, what about granular cell proliferation in the cerebellum? Or what about the rostral migratory stream from the subventricular zone where there are neuroblasts spitting out little new neurons that migrate into the nose to replenish the olfactory neuron population? Yes, that's all true.\\nThat does occur.\\nIt's been observed in mice.\\nIt's been observed in monkeys.\\nAnd to some extent, it's been observed in humans.\\nBut it's not, again, I repeat, it is not a prominent feature of learning and acquisition of new skills, new ideas or new emotional states.\\nPerhaps the best supported evidence for neurogenesis underlying new thoughts, experiences, abilities, emotions, et cetera, is the production of new neurons in that dentate gyrus subregion of the hippocampus.\\nAnd that probably does occur in humans.\\nBut neurogenesis is not really the dominant mode of changing neural circuitry in adult humans.\\nIt might be a player in adolescence, in young childhood.\\nIt is certainly a player before we are born when we are still in utero.\\nBut then the brain is being wired up in many different ways, including the addition of new neurons and changing of connections.\\nAll this is to say that while neurogenesis is a really sticky idea and it makes great headlines, the addition of new neurons is not really the way that the brain changes under psilocybin, other psychedelics, or just generally.\\nIt's perhaps responsible for maybe 1% to 2%, and I'm being generous there, of the rewiring events that are going to be most important for all of us.\\nSo we need to set that down and cement that there until further evidence comes out to the contrary.\\nThat's certainly where I, and here I feel comfortable speaking for the majority of neuroscientists out there, professional neuroscientists, that is.\\nThe papers showing adult neurogenesis are interesting, but they don't really explain most of the plasticity that occurs in the adult human brain.\\nSo if neurogenesis ain't it, what is? Well, it's very clear that psilocybin, other psychedelics, and any sort of behavioral or drug intervention that can induce neuroplasticity does so largely through the addition or strengthening of new neural connections or through the elimination or weakening of other neural connections.\\nAnd if you look at the data exploring the mechanistic basis for psilocybin-induced neuroplasticity, it's mostly focused on animal brains, animal models, mice and rats in particular, a little bit on primates, but mostly mice and rats, because that's where the interventions can be done of knockout animals, of imaging the brain in real time.\\nOf course, there are the beautiful studies of Robin Cardhart-Harris and others exploring neuroplasticity at the level of brain imaging, at the level of ultrasound measurements, of how active are certain brain areas in humans, how extensive is the modularity or not extensive is the modularity, et cetera, the stuff we talked about earlier.\\nSo in other words, there are neuroplasticity studies for the effects of psilocybin in humans.\\nBut in terms of underlying mechanisms of neuroplasticity, I think the predominant theory is that psilocybin induces neuroplasticity through the addition of novel connections in those pyramidal neurons of the frontal cortex elsewhere in the cortex, and certainly also in the visual cortex, probably also subcortically as well below the cerebral cortex in areas like the thalamus, maybe even in the brainstem as well.\\nAnd that those neuroplasticity events are structural and functional, and they involve a couple of basic events, the most prominent of which is the growth of dendrites.\\nDendrites are those little branches or processes that come out of the neurons, not just the pyramidal neurons, but other neurons as well.\\nBut since we're talking mainly about pyramidal neurons today, both the apical, those ones that top, they're called the apical tufts, they're the ones that reach laterally to connect with other neurons, communicate with other neurons that we talked about before, as well as the dendrites that come out of the base of those pyramidal neurons.\\nThose processes grow in response to psilocybin, as well as the addition of what are called dendritic spine.\\nSo the dendrites are the branches, the spines are these little protrusions that grow out.\\nThey actually, and here, I don't know if this is coincidence or not.\\nAgain, I always say I wasn't consult the design phase, but these little protrusions actually look like little mushrooms.\\nThey have a little stalk and they have a little head, a little spine head, and those little spine.\\nSo think of these as like little tiny mushroom appearing.\\nOkay, they aren't actual mushrooms.\\nOkay, the first person that puts in the comments, oh my goodness, I learned today that mushrooms grow out of our neurons when we take magic mushrooms.\\nThat is not what I'm saying.\\nWhat I'm saying is that these little mushroom-shaped protrusions that we're calling dendritic spines do in fact grow out of dendritic branches of neurons when animals ingest psilocybin or are injected with psilocybin, and that those little mushroom-shaped protrusions are the sites of new excitatory connections, new locations for input from other neurons to activate those neurons that have those little mushroom-shaped protrusions.\\nIf you'd like to see examples of this, both movies and still shots, it's pretty remarkable.\\nThere's a paper that I'll provide a link to in the show note captions.\\nThis was published in the journal Neuron, cell press journal, excellent journal, entitled, psilocybin induces rapid and persistent growth of dendritic spines in the frontal cortex in vivo.\\nSo these measurements were done in the mouse equivalent, more or less, of the prefrontal cortex.\\nThere's some interesting details in this paper, for instance, that those new connections persist, so they don't just grow out during the psilocybin being active in the bloodstream and brain of the animal, they persist, okay, so this may, again, may explain some of the persistent changes that occur in people after psilocybin journeys.\\nThey may, too, grow new spines.\\nI should also mention that a reduction in the number of dendritic spines, these little mushroom-shaped protrusions in the frontal cortex neurons of humans occurs in depressed patients.\\nWe know that from post-mortem tissue, and that drugs that relieve depression or that treatments, including behavioral treatments, that provide some relief from depression do seem to be correlated with increases in spine growth in frontal cortex neurons as well.\\nSo this raises a very interesting idea, which is perhaps it's the growth of new connections, these new dendritic spines, in particular, neurons that's created by administration of psilocybin that explains the relief from depression that people experience.\\nSo this is just one paper, but it's one paper of a growing body of work showing that, yes, indeed, psilocybin induces both structural and functional plasticity in the human and animal brain.\\nIt does that in the human brain at therapeutic doses of anywhere from 10 to 25, perhaps even 30 milligrams per session, one or two sessions.\\nI should mention that the mouse studies tended to use quite high doses of psilocybin.\\nI was actually, I wasn't shocked, but I was somewhat wide-eyed for a moment to realize that most of the studies looking at changes in plasticity in the mouse brain in response to psilocybin use the equivalent of one milligram per kilogram of body weight, which is if you do the math and you translate what we were talking about before in terms of dosages, I'll just spare you all the time, it's about double the sorts of dosages that are typically used in humans, maybe even triple in some cases.\\nNow, it's often the case in animal studies because of the metabolism of animals being different, but also because seeing effects of drugs in animal studies can be difficult.\\nThey did use a dose response anywhere from zero to 0.25 to half to one to two milligrams per kilogram of psilocybin in the study, so they had a dose response curve, but focused mainly on this one milligram per kilogram dosage.\\nIn any event, the point is that many of the studies that describe these pretty dramatic structural changes in the animal brain, most typically the mouse brain in response to psilocybin, use dosages of psilocybin that if translated to humans would be about double the human therapeutic dose.\\nSo that is something that we need to take into consideration.\\nNonetheless, it's very clear that in both animal studies and humans, psilocybin is inducing both structural and functional changes in brain circuitry and that in humans, the network connectivity is being changed dramatically.\\nWe talked about those data earlier and that the underlying basis for that might be, again, might be, we don't know for sure, the addition of new dendritic spines on these pyramidal neurons that we've been talking about repeatedly throughout today's episode, although neurogenesis perhaps and other modes of neuroplasticity such as the elimination of certain connections, perhaps related to unhealthy maladaptive thoughts or our feeling that a particular sad song is overwhelmingly sad.\\nIt could be the case that those sorts of things change subjectively because of the removal of neural connections.\\nIf you're going to think like a neurobiologist or scientist for that matter, you don't ever want to think that one mechanism can explain all the effects of a given drug or a given experience.\\nIt's almost certainly likely to be the consequence of multiple mechanisms acting in parallel.\\nAnd because I know there are people out there who would like to know even more about the neuroplasticity induced by psychedelics, including psilocybin, there's a wonderful review that I provide a link to in the show note captions entitled, Psychedelics and Neuroplasticity, a systematic review unraveling the biological underpinnings of psychedelics.\\nThis review is great because it goes a step beyond just psilocybin, psilocin binding to the serotonin 2A receptor and things like brain derived in a trophic factor.\\nIt actually talks a lot about the intracellular signaling and exactly how neurons change their excitability patterns based on this activation of the serotonin 2A receptor.\\nIt's probably more detailed than most of you out there are interested in, but if you are interested in that level of detail, this is a wonderful open access review.\\nSo a few minutes ago, I talked about where there is strong, modest and somewhat weak or rather I should say, minimal evidence for the therapeutic use of psilocybin to treat various disorders.\\nAnd across the board, it really appears that major depression and so-called intractable depression in some cases is where we're seeing the most exciting research to date.\\nNow keep in mind that because of the Controlled Substances Act being invoked in 1970 in the United States and because it was only just a few years ago really, only about five years ago that psychedelics including psilocybin received what's called breakthrough status at the FDA that there are now a lot of clinical trials exploring how psilocybin can impact various things like mood disorders, addictive disorders and so on.\\nPrior to 2018 when that therapeutic breakthrough potential was established in the United States, I think a lot of people in the so-called psychedelics community had the sense and really the belief that these drugs had enormous potential but they just weren't being explored that extensively.\\nSo I do want to give a nod to the incredible researchers such as Robin Cardart-Harris but also Matthew Johnson, Roland Griffiths, Nolan Williams and many others.\\nOkay, I'm certainly not listing off everybody that would take hours but those researchers have really pioneered both the legal efforts and the funding efforts and most importantly the research efforts defining the clinical data that I'm about to describe.\\nAnd here I'm going to summarize the clinical data in a bit of a top contour fashion, just giving you the kind of highlights.\\nWe will of course provide links to the papers if you'd like to look into it further but I'm only giving you the top contour because I've had the great fortune of having Matthew Johnson on this podcast before.\\nYou can find that episode at hubermanlab.com.\\nJust simply put Matt's name or psychedelics into the search function.\\nIt'll take you to that episode in all formats or links to all formats rather.\\nI've also had the great fortune of sitting down recently with Dr. Robin Cardart-Harris to talk about his work at University of California, San Francisco on psilocybin, LSD, ayahuasca and DMT as it relates to depression and other disorders.\\nAnd that episode which also will be released at hubermanlab.com and on all platforms, YouTube, Apple, Spotify, really goes in depth into these clinical studies and what those studies really look like.\\nWho's in the room? Whether or not people just get one dose or two doses, how far apart those are separated, all of that is covered in extensive detail in that what I found to be wonderful discussion with Dr. Robin Cardart-Harris.\\nSo if you're interested in all of the details as it relates to clinical application of psychedelics, stay tuned for that episode soon.\\nAgain, you can find that at hubermanlab.com and on all platforms.\\nIn the meantime, I would be remiss if I didn't include a bit of discussion about what has been observed in terms of using psilocybin journeys as a way to treat depression because the data are just, oh, so exciting.\\nAgain, these data really started to surface as the consequence of studies that were initiated around 2006 in just a few select laboratories and then really picked up in terms of the number of laboratories and number of studies between 2018 and now.\\nSo what you'll notice is that most of the papers I'm about to describe were published in, for instance, phenomenal journals, New England Journal of Medicine in 2021, New England Journal of Medicine, November, 2022, Journal of the American Medical Association Psychiatry just very recently, 2021.\\nSo these are very recent papers.\\nEssentially, all of these clinical studies involve either one or two psilocybin sessions.\\nThe dosages that were explored range from zero milligrams, placebo, if you will, 10 milligrams, in some cases, 25 milligrams, in some cases, 30 milligrams.\\nAnd most typically people receive the same dosage for both sessions if indeed they did both sessions.\\nHowever, there's at least one study looking at just one single episode of psilocybin administration.\\nSo this is the paper entitled, no surprise, single dose psilocybin for treatment resistant episode of major depression.\\nThis was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in November of 2022.\\nI'll just summarize the results of this single application study.\\nThey randomly assigned subjects who had treatment resistant depression.\\nSo they'd resisted treatment to other things to receive a single dose of a synthetic formulation of psilocybin.\\nSo they're not eating mushrooms, they're getting a synthetic dose of psilocybin, but the dose is known of either 25 milligrams, 10 milligrams, or one milligram, which was the control.\\nAnd they receive psychological support.\\nThere were a number of different tests, subjective tests of depression taken before and after the psilocybin journey.\\nThey had about 75 to 79 participants in each group, again, at the three different doses, 25, 10, or one milligram.\\nAnd they looked at the changes in these scores, these depression related scores on these tests.\\nThere are many results from this paper, one could summarize, but among the most important results, I can summarize from the discussion, and here I'm paraphrasing that the change in baseline levels of depression, that is, at week three, following the psilocybin session, was significantly better.\\nThat is, people experienced more relief or more people experienced more relief from the 25 milligram dose than from the one milligram dose.\\nAnd this is important, there was no significant difference between the 10 milligram dose and the one milligram dose.\\nThis really points to the fact that the 25 to 30 milligram dose that's used in the largest numbers of studies exploring treatment-resistant depression really seems to be, I don't want to say the best dose, but the most effective dose, at least in this clinical context, in this set and setting, and with this particular patient population.\\nSo we want to be careful to say that so that one doesn't just translate that 25 milligrams is better than 10 milligrams, although in this study it was for sake of treatment-resistant depression relief.\\nThere were a number of other key aspects of this paper, in particular, the exploration of so-called adverse events, so things like headaches, propensity for self-harm, actual self-harm, anxiety, and so on.\\nIt's worth mentioning that there were adverse events in essentially every group.\\nThe number of adverse events was highest in the 25 milligram dose group, and this is observed in other studies as well.\\nWith higher dosages, there tends to be greater relief from depressive symptoms, but also a greater chance for adverse events.\\nSome of those adverse events can be quite severe, so feelings of suicidal ideation, et cetera.\\nSome of them one could consider a little less severe, mild headache, or severe headache that was transient, or anxiety that was transient.\\nAgain, highly individual responses.\\nWe could go line by line and table by table through this paper, which we won't, because there's a lot of data.\\nAgain, we'll provide a link to this paper if you'd like to peruse it yourself.\\nIt's fairly straightforward to read.\\nThat's one thing that's nice about these clinical trials is they tend to be written in fairly non-technical language, although there's a little bit of technical language.\\nThe important point is that a single dose of 25 milligrams of psilocybin provided significant relief from treatment-resistant depression in this particular patient population, but it is not the case that 100% of the people who took 25 milligrams of psilocybin experienced that relief.\\nHowever, the majority of them did.\\nNow, when you say majority in science, you really need to look to numbers.\\nAnd the reason I'm not telling you, oh, it was 75% or 60% or 50% is because it depends on which time point people were analyzed.\\nPeople were asked about their level of depression relief immediately after, one week after, two weeks after, or three weeks after.\\nAnd the degree of relief tended to change over time.\\nIn fact, it tended to diminish over time, but it was also stable, or remarkably stable, I should say, at least by my read, in the 25 milligram dose group.\\nAnd that is summarized nicely in figure two of the paper because they explored these people's levels of depression out to week 12, and they still saw a significant degree of depression relief 12 weeks after the single 25 milligram psilocybin dose session.\\nSo as I mentioned earlier, there are now about a dozen or so excellent studies, clinical trials, exploring the use of single or two-session psilocybin treatment in that 25 to 30 milligram range, which seems to be the most effective dose for long-lasting relief from depression.\\nEach one of those studies explored something different, as is important.\\nReplication is also important, of course, in order to validate previous studies.\\nBut for instance, there have been comparisons of psilocybin versus SSRIs or other antidepressants.\\nThere have been comparisons of psilocybin plus psychoanalysis or cognitive behavioral therapy versus cognitive behavioral therapy alone or psychoanalysis alone.\\nAnd so there's a lot of evaluation now of the clinical outcomes and the statistical outcomes of these subjective measures, and even some objective measures of neurochemistry where that's possible in terms of trying to understand if and how psilocybin is effective for the treatment of depression.\\nAnd the major takeaway is that, indeed, it does seem to be the case.\\nAnd the numbers that I feel comfortable not throwing out there but putting out to you reflect my conversation with Robin Cardhart-Harris.\\nAgain, that will be released soon at hubermanlab.com, as well as takeaways from what I would say are the six broadest studies, meaning they have the widest range of age groups, the broadest demographic in terms of the subjects, their backgrounds, their levels of education, men, women, ethnicity, et cetera.\\nAnd a lot of that can be summarized in the paper entitled Effects of Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy on Major Depressive Disorder.\\nThis was a particular randomized clinical trial.\\nBut in the discussion, I think they summarize it quite well, which is that if you look at the number of people who take this 25-milligram dose twice in sessions spaced about a week apart, what you will find is that anywhere from 60 to 75% of the people who have major depressive disorder, who do these psilocybin sessions in the proper setting, report a good experience with it, have minimal adverse events coming out of those sessions and in the weeks following, those people experience substantial positive relief from major depression in ways that other treatments that they had explored, including antidepressant drugs, cognitive behavioral therapy, and other types of therapy alone could not provide.\\nNow, it's a general feature of these clinical trials focusing on psilocybin that people are asked to stop taking their antidepressants prior to participating in the trial.\\nIt's also a general feature of these trials that people are encouraged to not suddenly start their antidepressant treatment immediately afterwards, because of course that could confound the results of the psilocybin treatment.\\nAnd this is a very important thing to note, all subjects were encouraged not to avoid taking those antidepressant medications if in fact their clinician felt that it was important for their immediate and long-term survival.\\nSo, no one should be reckless in thinking about what to add or delete from their drug protocol when dealing with depression, right? The outcomes could be very severe in that case.\\nNonetheless, we can paraphrase from the discussion of the paper I just mentioned, because it really highlights the incredible results that psilocybin applied in these particular therapeutic settings are providing.\\nAnd here again, I'm paraphrasing.\\nThe present trial showed that psilocybin administered in the context of supportive psychotherapy, consisting of approximately 11 hours of psychotherapy.\\nSo this is going to be two sessions of the psilocybin with proper therapeutic support, produced large rapid and sustained antidepressant effects.\\nThe effect sizes reported in the study were approximately 2.5 times greater than the effects sizes found in psychotherapy, and more than four times greater than the effect sizes found in psychopharmacologic depression treatment studies.\\nIn other words, four times the positive effect observed with typical SSRIs or other pharmacology of that sort.\\nThese findings are consistent with the literature that showed that combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy were more efficacious in the treatment of major depressive disorder than either intervention alone.\\nSo again, this points to the fact that combining drug therapy with talk therapy, as it's often called, is going to be more effective than either treatment alone.\\nHere the drug therapy is psilocybin therapy.\\nAnd again, please don't take the fact that in these studies they tended to ask people to not take their antidepressant medication heading into the study as a sign that one should stop taking their antidepressant medication.\\nRather, I think this study and other studies like it, again, which we'll provide links to in the show note captions that are discussed extensively in the episode with Dr. Cardart-Harris soon to come, really point to the incredible role that psilocybin can have in creating an experience inside of the session, the journey or the trip, as it's called, as well as initiating neuroplastic events, perhaps the addition of dendritic spines, maybe even some new neurons, maybe, although I don't think that's the predominant mode.\\nBut that leads to these more extensive connectivities in the brain, the so-called reduction in modular networks, enhanced activity in brain areas that normally wouldn't be talking to one another, but not doing that in any kind of haphazard way.\\nIt really does seem that the one or two sessions of psilocybin that induce these feelings of ego dissolution, that induce these feelings of oceanic boundlessness, right? So mystical, right? And in many ways it's what I find so incredible about psilocybin and other psychedelics is that despite the highly mystical, highly subjective, and still at this time, somewhat top contour understanding of how they might exert their effects, you can highlight boldface and underline might there, right? Because it hasn't really been firmly established what the exact cell biological rewiring events are.\\nBut there is now what I would refer to as a center of mass of data that point to the fact that psilocybin, when taken in the appropriate set and setting, at the appropriate dosages, can invoke the sorts of neuroplasticity and changes in emotionality, in perceptual experience, not just during the psychedelic session, but for long periods of time after the psychedelic session that can provide really remarkable relief from things like major depression and perhaps other psychiatric issues as well.\\nAnd of course, I realize that many of you are listening to and are watching this episode and you're not necessarily depressed or thinking about psychedelics like psilocybin in the context of depression.\\nI hope today's discussion allowed you to better understand how psychedelics and psilocybin in particular, because that's what we've been talking about, are able to exert these incredible effects that they seem to exert.\\nThis is not a call for everyone to run out and do psilocybin.\\nIt is absolutely not that.\\nIt is, however, my attempt to really put a magnifying lens on this incredible area of research that's happening, not just in the context of clinical trials, but in the context of trying to understand how serotonin and how drugs like psilocybin, which in many ways mimic serotonin, and more particularly the activation of particular receptors in the brain, like the serotonin 2A receptor.\\nI mean, just sit back and think about that.\\nThe selective activation of this receptor, which is, by the way, associated with the expansion of the neocortex across evolution, didn't mention that before, but indeed it is, how that can lead to enhanced ways of thinking, changed ways of thinking, actual learning inside of this short four-hour or six-hour session that we call the psilocybin journey.\\nSo as is often the case, perhaps as is always the case here on the Huberman Lab Podcast, we did a deep dive into a topic today into the topic of psilocybin, what it is, how it works, the different ways in which it changes brain circuitry, how it creates the experiences that we think of as the psilocybin journey, what the safety issues are, what the so-called set and setting are that can lend themselves to positive therapeutic outcomes.\\nAnd in doing so, my goal was really to highlight several things.\\nFirst of all, I am very excited about the potential for psychedelics such as psilocybin to provide relief for mental health issues that to date have been very hard for people to access.\\nIn addition to that, I'm just fundamentally interested in the brain and how it works and how it can change this thing we call neuroplasticity.\\nTo me, neuroplasticity is the holy grail of the human nervous system.\\nAs far as we know, we are the animal that can have long lasting neuroplasticity throughout the lifespan.\\nAnd if it requires the use of compounds in a safe and controlled way, such as psilocybin, in order to achieve maximal plasticity in a short amount of time, that's exciting.\\nBut of course, that also needs to be considered with all of the safety precautions in mind that we talked about earlier, including the fact that people who have a predisposition or who have psychosis or bipolar disorder or a relative that has psychosis or bipolar disorder, younger people, meaning people 25 years of age and younger, and really anyone who's not working with a dedicated and highly trained physician needs to be very cautious about these compounds as well.\\nThey're very exciting.\\nI think psilocybin is an exciting and super interesting compound for basic and clinical reasons and for other reasons as well.\\nBut they are sharp blades, as we say.\\nAnd with sharp blades, you can do incredible things, but you can also cut yourself very badly.\\nSo all those considerations need to be taken to mind.\\nSo I consider the science and use of psilocybin to be an exciting, but still preliminary area that I certainly am paying a lot of attention to, and I know there's a lot of excitement about.\\nSo stay tuned for the episode with Dr. Robin Cardart-Harris, and we will probably revisit psilocybin, and we will certainly revisit the other psychedelics and non-classical psychedelics, including LSD, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, ketamine, MDMA, mescaline, and all the rest in future episodes as well.\\nIf you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast, please subscribe to our YouTube channel.\\nThat's the best, zero-cost way to support

much during today's episode, but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast, we talk about supplements.\\nWhile supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people do derive tremendous benefit from them for things like enhancing the quality and duration of their sleep, for things like improving focus and for hormone augmentation and much more.\\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is proud to have partnered with Momentous Supplements.\\nIf you'd like to learn more about the supplements discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast, you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S, so livemomentous.com slash Huberman.\\nIf you haven't already subscribed to our Huberman Lab podcast neural network newsletter, the neural network newsletter is a completely zero cost newsletter that includes summaries of podcast episodes and summaries of protocols, things like a toolkit for improving your sleep, a toolkit for improving focus, toolkit for neuroplasticity, toolkit related to deliberate cold or deliberate heat exposure to fitness, to flexibility and much more.\\nAgain, all zero cost.\\nSimply go to hubermanlab.com, go to the menu, scroll down to newsletter and provide your email.\\nWe do not share your email with anybody.\\nAnd again, the newsletter is completely zero cost.\\nAnd to see previous newsletters, you can simply scroll down a bit further on that neural network newsletter page at hubermanlab.com and you'll find downloadable PDFs.\\nAnd you can just click on any of those PDFs, no signup required.\\nAnd if you're not already following me on social media, it's Huberman Lab on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.\\nAnd on all those places, I discuss science and science related tools, some of which overlaps with the content of the Huberman Lab podcast, but much of which is distinct from the content covered here on the Huberman Lab podcast.\\nSo again, it's Huberman Lab on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.\\nThank you once again for joining me for today's discussion all about psilocybin.\\nAnd last but certainly not least, thank you for your interest in science.\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\n\", metadata={'source': 'docs/youtube/How
