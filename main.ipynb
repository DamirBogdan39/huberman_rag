       "[Document(page_content=\"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\nwhere we discuss science\\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\\nand I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology\\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\\nToday, we are discussing caffeine.\\nCaffeine is one of the most widely used substances\\non the planet.\\nEstimates are that more than 90% of adults\\nand as many as 50% of kids, that is adolescents and teenagers,\\nuse caffeine on a daily basis.\\nCaffeine is an amazing molecule.\\nMost people are familiar with caffeine's ability\\nto increase alertness\\nand to reduce our feelings of sleepiness and fatigue.\\nAnd indeed, it does that.\\nBut what most people are not aware of\\nis that caffeine acts as a strong reinforcer.\\nWhat I mean by reinforcer\\nis that when caffeine is present in a drink or food,\\nand yes, indeed, caffeine is present in many foods,\\neven unbeknownst to us,\\nwhen it's present in drinks and foods,\\nwe actively come to like those foods and drinks\\nmore than if caffeine were not contained\\nin those foods and drinks.\\nSo it reinforces our liking of particular foods and drinks,\\nand indeed, it even reinforces our liking\\nof the containers they are consumed from\\nand the company we keep\\nwhen we consume foods and drinks that contain caffeine.\\nThat is, caffeine is not just a stimulant,\\ncaffeine is a reinforcer,\\nand it's a reinforcer that plays an active role\\nin almost everybody's daily life.\\nWe can say that with confidence\\nbecause, as I mentioned a moment ago,\\nmore than 90% of people are consuming caffeine,\\nand most people think that they consume caffeine\\nbecause it makes them feel more alert.\\nBut there are many reasons why you're consuming caffeine,\\nand I'm not going to tell you\\nthat consuming caffeine isn't necessarily bad.\\nIn fact, today, I'm going to tell you\\nabout many of the positive health benefits of caffeine,\\nincluding neuroprotective effects,\\nanti-depressive effects,\\nand certainly performance-enhancing effects,\\nboth for mental performance and for physical performance.\\nNow, that said, there are certain situations\\nin which you want to avoid caffeine,\\nand there are certain people who might opt to avoid caffeine.\\nThat's especially the case when one thinks about caffeine\\nnot just as a stimulant, but as a reinforcer.\\nIn fact, caffeine is such a strong reinforcer\\nthat if even tiny amounts of caffeine are present\\nin certain foods and drinks,\\nyou will very quickly come to prefer those foods and drinks\\nover other choices,\\nwhich can be a good thing or a bad thing,\\ndepending on what sorts of food and drink choices\\nyou're trying to make.\\nSo today, I'm going to inform you\\nabout how caffeine works at a mechanistic level.\\nI promise to do that with a minimum of nomenclature\\nand such that even if you don't have a background\\nin biology, you will be able to digest\\nthat information easily.\\nAnd then I'll tell you how to use caffeine to your advantage,\\nor conversely, how to avoid caffeine\\nat certain times to your advantage.\\nSo today's episode will focus both on mechanisms and tools\\nthat is the use and leverage of caffeine\\nto improve mental health, physical health, and performance.\\nBefore we go any further into today's discussion,\\nI want to tell you about some recent results\\nabout a molecule that's found in certain caffeinated\\nbeverages and that has been proven to be very useful\\nfor both weight loss, mental performance,\\nand controlling blood sugar levels.\\nAnd that's GLP-1 or glucagon-like peptide-1.\\nGlucagon-like peptide-1 is found in the brain and body.\\nIt acts both on the brain and body.\\nIt does many different things,\\nbut one of its primary effects that's been discovered\\nis to reduce hunger, and it does that two ways.\\nIt does that by activating certain neurons\\nin your hypothalamus, so that's a brain region\\nthat controls hunger and satiety.\\nIt makes us feel full at the level of the brain,\\nso it makes us feel sated, that is,\\nand it actually makes us feel full.\\nTurns out that GLP-1 acts on certain receptors in the gut\\nto make us feel as if we've ingested enough food.\\nIt doesn't necessarily make us feel\\nas if our gut is distended, but it makes us feel full.\\nThat's really interesting, because if you think about it,\\nwhen we eat, our stomach fills up, obviously,\\nand that information has to be communicated to the brain\\nsuch that the brain can then send satiety signals\\nthat actually shut off our hunger.\\nAnd believe it or not, the brain actually activates signals\\nto reduce the desire to chew when our stomach is full.\\nAnd GLP-1, as I mentioned, works on the brain\\nto create these feelings of satiety,\\nas if we've had enough,\\nand to reduce our desire to eat more.\\nAnd GLP-1 acts directly on the gut\\nto give us a slight sense of fullness in the gut,\\nwhich then is communicated to the brain.\\nSo really, there are two parallel signals being sent\\nwhen we have GLP-1 present in our system.\\nNow, a little bit of relevant history on GLP-1,\\nit was actually discovered in Gila monsters.\\nThese are these reptiles that can go long periods of time\\nwithout eating, and a very clever scientist decided\\nto study why it is that certain animals, like Gila monsters,\\ncan go a long period of time without ingesting anything,\\nand it's because they produce very large amounts of GLP-1.\\nThey isolate the peptide from GLP-1,\\nthen they looked for the analogous peptide in humans,\\nand it turns out that does exist.\\nAnd as I mentioned, it's released in both brain and body\\nto make you feel full and sated.\\nWhy am I telling you all this?\\nWell, today we're going to talk about caffeine,\\nand there's one particular caffeine source,\\nwhich is yerba mate, and there's some other forms of teas,\\nsimilar to yerba mate,\\nthat stimulate the release of GLP-1 significantly.\\nThere are also nowadays drugs,\\nwhich are called analogs of GLP-1,\\nso these are drugs that mimic or are identical\\nto the kind of GLP-1 that you would make,\\nand those drugs are proving to be very effective\\nfor the treatment of certain forms of diabetes\\nand for the treatment of obesity,\\nbut they trigger enormous amounts\\nof GLP-1 pathway activation.\\nSo those are extreme cases for people\\nthat are really struggling for weight loss,\\nbut the clinical trials and the data that are out there\\nin the general population now are very, very promising\\nfor GLP-1 analogs.\\nYerba mate tea, provided it's not the smoked variety,\\nand I mention that because a number of people\\nhave cued me to the fact that yerba mate teas\\ncome in smoked varieties and non-smoked varieties,\\nand the smoked varieties are thought\\nto perhaps be carcinogenic, that is, pro-cancer causing.\\nSo I advise people to avoid smoked varieties\\nof yerba mate tea, but yerba mate teas are known\\nto stimulate significant amounts of GLP-1 release,\\nand so they can be effective as a weight loss tool,\\nmainly by blunting appetite, and again, they do that\\nboth at the level of the brain and at the level of the gut.\\nNow, all of what I just told you has been known\\nfor some period of time, but there are a new set\\nof findings that were just published\\nin Cell Reports Medicine, Cell Press Journal,\\nexcellent journal, which indicate exactly how it is\\nthat GLP-1 stimulates both satiety\\nand can trigger additional weight loss\\nthrough other mechanisms.\\nAnd I find the mechanism to be really interesting\\nand actually really important, given some other topics\\nwe've covered on this podcast before.\\nSo the basic finding is that GLP-1,\\nwhether or not it's stimulated through the release\\nof analog drug that one is prescribed,\\nor by drinking yerba mate tea, for instance,\\nand stimulate release of your own\\nso-called endogenous GLP-1, yes, it makes you feel more full\\nat the level of brain and body, but it turns out\\nit also stimulates thermogenesis.\\nNow, thermogenesis is the active utilization\\nof more metabolic energy, and fat cells,\\nin particular, so-called beige and brown fat cells,\\nare a potent source of thermogenic activity in your body.\\nThe basic background is that you have white adipose cells,\\nso white fat cells, you have beige fat cells,\\nand you have brown fat cells, and the beige and brown ones\\nare fat cells that you actually want more of.\\nThey are not abundant under your skin,\\nthey're abundant really around your clavicles\\nand your upper neck, they are the ones that generate heat,\\nand the beige and brownness of them\\nis actually the consequence of having\\na lot of mitochondria in those cells.\\nWhen GLP-1 is elevated in your system,\\nit turns out that it communicates to those white fat cells\\nand helps convert them into beige and brown fat cells,\\nthat is, it takes fat cells that are not doing\\nanything useful for you except being stored energy,\\nand I think most people out there would like to have fewer\\nof those white adipose cells, there are few of you out there\\nthat actually need more of them that are too thin, too lean,\\nbut most people are suffering from having too many\\nof these white adipose cells.\\nWell, when you ingest yerba mate tea\\nor you were to take a GLP-1 analog\\nor stimulate GLP-1 in any number of different ways,\\nyes, you stimulate increased satiety,\\nbut you're also stimulating the conversion\\nof these white fat cells into beige and brown fat cells,\\nwhich makes you more thermogenic,\\nand over time, raises your basal metabolic rate,\\nso you're burning more calories even at rest.\\nIt also makes you feel as if you're more comfortable\\nin colder environments at rest.\\nThis is very much the same as the mechanism\\nthat's induced when you were to, say, take a cold shower\\nor do regular ice baths or get into cold water regularly,\\nthat too stimulates the conversion of white fat cells\\nto beige and brown fat cells.\\nSo I like these findings very much\\nbecause they provide a mechanistic coherence,\\nthey provide, that is, a really nice story\\nas to how something like GLP-1\\ncould be so effective for weight loss.\\nYes, on the one hand, GLP-1 is reducing appetite,\\nand that, of course, will help people maintain or lose weight,\\nbut it's also increasing basal metabolic rate,\\nand we now know how that's accomplished.\\nIt's likely accomplished,\\nat least through this one mechanism,\\nby the stimulation of conversion of these white fat cells,\\nwhich don't do much for us except as energy storage units,\\nto these metabolically mitochondrial-rich beige\\nand brown fat cells,\\nwhich you can think of as sort of the oil in the candle\\nthat allows your furnace, your metabolism,\\nto burn at a higher temperature and a higher rate.\\nSo that's the mechanism, and the basic tool takeaway\\nis that if you are somebody who's interested\\nin losing weight and you want to leverage the GLP-1 pathway,\\ndrinking a cup or two of yerba mate tea early in the day\\nwould be a great way to stimulate GLP-1 release.\\nThere are other ways to stimulate GLP-1 release.\\nYou can get it through certain forms of exercise,\\nin particular, fasted exercise.\\nThis is actually a vote in favor of fasted exercise.\\nThere's a debate as to whether or not fasted cardio\\nburns more fat than non-fasted cardio,\\nand the data basically say, no, it doesn't really matter,\\nbut that doesn't really take into account\\nthe longer arc of things like GLP-1 release,\\nso that needs to be taken into consideration.\\nSo you could do fasted cardio.\\nYou could drink yerba mate tea,\\nkeeping in mind that yerba mate tea does contain caffeine.\\nWe'll talk more about the specific forms of stimulants,\\nincluding caffeine, that mate has,\\nbut mate would be a great way to stimulate GLP-1 release.\\nAnd then, of course, for those of you that are interested\\nin more robust activation of GLP-1,\\nthen perhaps you might want to consider\\nsome of the new prescription GLP-1 analogs\\nthat are out there,\\nbut that's a more severe stimulus for GLP-1, of course.\\nAnd for everybody, regardless of whether or not\\nyou're trying to lose weight, gain weight, or maintain weight,\\nI think we're going to be hearing a lot more\\nabout GLP-1 analogs and drinks and supplements\\nand things of that sort that stimulate GLP-1\\nin the very near future,\\nbecause it does appear to be\\na very important biological mechanism.\\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\\nthat this podcast is separate from my teaching\\nand research roles at Stanford.\\nIt is, however, part of my desire and effort\\nto bring zero cost to consumer information about science\\nand science-related tools to the general public.\\nIn keeping with that theme,\\nI'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.\\nOur first sponsor is Levels.\\nLevels is a program that lets you see\\nhow different foods affect your health\\nby giving you real-time feedback on your diet\\nusing a continuous glucose monitor.\\nNow, blood glucose, or blood sugar,\\nis a critical aspect of your immediate and long-term health\\nand, indeed, your feelings of vigor\\nand mental clarity and wellbeing at any moment.\\nOne of the key things is to know\\nhow different foods and food combinations\\nand timing of food intake is impacting blood glucose.\\nAnd with Levels, you're able to assess\\nall of that in real time.\\nI tried Levels, and what it taught me, for instance,\\nwas that I can eat certain foods at certain times of day,\\nbut if I eat them at other times of day,\\nI get a blood sugar crash.\\nIt also taught me, for instance,\\nhow to space my exercise and my food intake.\\nTurns out, for me, exercising fasted\\nis far more beneficial.\\nThat's something I learned using Levels,\\nand it's completely transformed\\nnot just the spacing and timing of my diet and exercise,\\nbut also use of things like the sauna and other activities.\\nIt's been a tremendous learning for me\\nthat's really shaped an enormous number of factors\\nin my life that have led to me feeling far more vigorous\\nwith far more mental focus and physical strength\\nand endurance.\\nSo if you're interested in learning more about Levels\\nand trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself,\\ngo to

sleep tracking capacity.\\nI've talked many times on this podcast\\nabout the critical relationship\\nbetween sleep and body temperature.\\nThat is, in order to fall asleep\\nand stay deeply asleep throughout the night,\\nour body temperature needs to drop\\nby about one to three degrees.\\nAnd conversely, when we wake up in the morning,\\nthat is in large part because of our body\\nheating up by one to three degrees.\\nNow, people have different core body temperatures,\\nand they tend to run colder or hotter throughout the night.\\n8 Sleep allows you to adjust the temperature\\nof your sleeping environment\\nso that you have the optimal temperature\\nthat gets you the best night's sleep.\\nI started sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover\\nabout eight months ago,\\nand it has completely transformed my sleep.\\nI sleep so much deeper.\\nI wake up far less during the middle of the night,\\nif at all, and I wake up feeling far better\\nthan I ever have, even after the same amount of sleep.\\nIf you want to try 8 Sleep,\\nyou can go to 8sleep.com slash Huberman\\nto save up to $400 off their Sleep Fit Holiday Bundle,\\nwhich includes their new Pod 3 cover.\\n8 Sleep

makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\\nthat are of the absolute highest quality.\\nThe company was founded\\nby two all-American swimmers from Stanford,\\nand everything about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses\\nwere designed with performance in mind.\\nI've spent a lifetime working on the biology,\\nthe visual system, and I can tell you\\nthat your visual system has to contend\\nwith an enormous number of challenges\\nin order for you to see clearly,\\nfor instance, when you move from a sunny area\\nto a shady area and back again,\\nwhether or not you're looking at something up close\\nor off into the distance.\\nRoca understands the biology of the visual system\\nand has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses accordingly\\nso that you always see with perfect clarity.\\nRoca eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed\\nfor activities such as running and cycling,\\nand indeed they are very lightweight.\\nMost of the time, I can't even remember\\nthat they're on my face, they're so lightweight.\\nBut the important thing to know\\nabout Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses\\nis that while they can be used during sports activities,\\nthey also have a terrific aesthetic\\nand they can be used just as well for wearing to work\\nor out to dinner, et cetera.\\nIf you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses,\\nyou can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A.com\\nand enter the code

Supplements.\\nTo find the supplements we discuss\\non the Huberman Lab Podcast,\\nyou can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,\\nlivemomentus.com slash Huberman.\\nAnd I should just mention that the library\\nof those supplements is constantly expanding.\\nAgain, that's livemomentus.com slash Huberman.\\nLet's talk about caffeine.\\nSo as I mentioned earlier,\\ncaffeine is consumed by basically most all adults\\nevery single day and consumed at very regular times each day.\\nIn fact, if you were to take a look at your caffeine intake\\nor the caffeine intake of somebody close to you,\\nwhat you would realize is that they don't do so well\\nif their caffeine intake arrives even 10, 20\\nor 30 minutes past their expected\\nor usual intake of caffeine.\\nThat's pretty remarkable.\\nAnd it brings to mind ideas that we are all\\nquote unquote addicted to caffeine\\nor that caffeine is somehow bad.\\nI'm certainly not going to make the argument\\nthat caffeine is bad.\\nFirst of all, I'm a regular caffeine user.\\nI wouldn't call myself a caffeine abuser,\\nbut I am a regular caffeine user.\\nAnd caffeine is known to have certain health benefits.\\nI listed off a few of them earlier,\\nbut I'll mention those again now before going forward.\\nCaffeine is known to have certain neuroprotective effects.\\nAnd that is because of its ability\\nto increase neuromodulators such as dopamine,\\nbut also other so-called catecholamines\\nlike norepinephrine.\\nIf you don't know what those names mean,\\nthese are molecules that increase levels of alertness,\\nmotivation and drive.\\nAnd so then therefore not surprisingly,\\nthe large scale analysis of the relationship\\nbetween depression and caffeine\\nshows that provided people are not drinking so much caffeine\\nthat it makes them overly anxious,\\nthat regular intake of caffeine\\nis inversely related to levels of depression.\\nSo it may have some antidepressant effects\\nand those could be direct or indirect.\\nWhat do I mean by that?\\nWell, you could imagine that if people are ingesting caffeine\\nand they are more motivated to do work\\nand pursue quality social interactions,\\nthen the probability that they will have depression\\ncould be lower.\\nIt could also be that there are direct effects\\non the chemical systems of the brain\\nthat relate to mood and wellbeing\\nthat could offset depression.\\nIt is not clear whether or not the effects\\nof caffeine encountering depression\\nare direct or indirect.\\nNonetheless, there's a relationship there\\nand it's an interesting and positive one.\\nOr I should say negative correlation,\\npositive effect overall on mood and wellbeing to be exact.\\nNow it's also the case that caffeine can improve\\nmental performance and physical performance.\\nThis has been demonstrated in tens of thousands of studies.\\nI will review a few studies on this in particular today,\\nbut to just give you a sense of how caffeine works\\nat the level of its timing and impact\\non mental performance and physical performance.\\nWhen we ingest caffeine,\\nprovided that we don't have a lot of food in our stomach\\nand that our blood sugar isn't particularly high,\\ngenerally we experience an increase in alertness\\nwithin about five minutes.\\nAnd that increase in focus and alertness peaks\\naround 30 minutes after ingestion of caffeine\\nand persists for as long as 60 minutes.\\nNow this is assuming that one takes caffeine in pill form\\nor drinks the entire caffeine drink\\nwithin a short period of time.\\nBut a little bit later,\\nI'll talk about how you can consume caffeine\\nat regular intervals while doing mental work\\nor physical work in a way that can further increase\\nmental performance and physical performance.\\nBut let's just touch on what caffeine intake\\nreally does for mental performance and physical performance.\\nPerhaps the most robust finding across all of the studies\\nthat I've examined is that caffeine reduces\\nour reaction time, that is it improves our reaction time.\\nIt doesn't make it longer, it makes it shorter.\\nSo for instance, in a laboratory study\\nwhere people were asked to hit a lever\\nevery time they hear a tone,\\nyou can greatly reduce the time between the tone\\nand the pressing of the lever\\nif people ingest caffeine about 30 minutes\\nbefore they do that task.\\nNow that seems like a trivial task,\\nbut this is also seen in the domain of sports performance\\nand even in cognitive performance\\nwhere people have to arrive at a particular answer\\nto a question and the answer to that question\\nhas to be pulled from their memory banks within their brain,\\ntheir hippocampus, for instance,\\na brain structure involved in memory.\\nAnd if you are asking people, for instance,\\nto remember the capitals of different states or cities\\nor to remember certain historical facts,\\nthey will do that at a particular rate.\\nBut if they've ingested caffeine within the hour prior,\\ntheir ability to recall that information\\nis much, much better.\\nThey are faster and it does not appear\\nthat accuracy is reduced.\\nIn fact, in many cases, accuracy is enhanced.\\nAnd that's because caffeine both works\\non the reaction time systems of the brain and body.\\nI'll talk about the mechanisms for that in a little bit,\\nbut it also stimulates certain neurotransmitters\\nand so-called neuromodulators within the brain and body\\nthat give the neural circuits in the brain\\nthat are associated with learning and memory\\na lower threshold to activation.\\nWhat does that mean?\\nThat means that we are better able to access\\nthe brain circuitry involved in learning and memory\\nwhen we have a certain amount of caffeine\\ncirculating in our system.\\nSo this makes caffeine an incredible\\nperformance enhancing compound.\\nAnd I could give you tens of thousands\\nof examples of this in humans.\\nBut before I do that, I want to just touch on\\nwhat we know about the existence of caffeine in nature\\nand what the existence of caffeine in nature\\nand its effects on other animals\\ntells us about what caffeine does in humans.\\nBecause as I alluded to earlier,\\nwhat caffeine is doing for us is not just\\nmaking us more alert, improving our memory,\\nimproving our reaction time and so on.\\nIt's actually acting as a powerful reinforcer of experience.\\nAnd it's acting as not just a powerful reinforcer\\nof the caffeine containing drink that we drink,\\nbut also the mug that it's contained in,\\nplus the person that we might be sitting across from\\nwhen we consume that caffeine and so on.\\nIf it's a little bit hard for you to conceptualize\\nwhat a reinforcer is and why I'm calling it a reinforcer,\\nlet me spell it out in three specific ways.\\nWe often hear about the word reward.\\nAnd we think, okay, if we do certain things\\nand we like the outcome,\\nthen those certain things are rewarded, right?\\nIf we're doing something, we receive praise,\\nthe praise is the reward.\\nAnd therefore we are more likely\\nto do that thing in the future.\\nIn fact, a lot of parenting is like that.\\nAnd a lot of life is like that.\\nHowever, when we hear the word reward,\\nwe often think about something that feels good to us.\\nAnd certainly if we've worked hard and we get some praise,\\nthat's natural for the praise to feel good to us.\\nOr for instance, if we work very hard\\nand we get a certain outcome, a trophy, a financial outcome,\\na degree outcome, recognition, et cetera,\\nall of those can act as rewards,\\nbut those are all conscious rewards.\\nWe are aware that they are happening.\\nReinforcers are a little bit different\\nbecause the word reinforcement can apply\\nto conscious rewards of the sort that I just described.\\nBut there are also many ways in which caffeine stimulates\\nthe release of chemicals in our body that act as reinforcers.\\nBut those reinforcers are subconscious.\\nThat is, we are not aware that they cause this preference\\nfor the activities that cause their release.\\nSo the study I'm about to describe beautifully,\\nI believe, encapsulates how is it that humans came\\nto consume caffeine and why caffeine exists in nature\\nand the powerful effects of caffeine as a reinforcing agent,\\nboth in animals, insects, and in you and me.\\nAnd the title of the paper is Caffeine and Floral Nectar\\nEnhances a Pollinator's Memory of Reward.\\nKeep in mind that caffeine is made from plants.\\nSome of you will say, duh,\\nbut I think some of us don't realize\\nthat the reason why there is caffeine in coffee\\nis because coffee comes from a plant.\\nIt's a coffee bean.\\nCertain teas, which of course are plants that people brew,\\ncaffeine is contained in those teas, such as yerba mate.\\nWell, why would this bitter substance,\\nbecause in fact, caffeine is quite bitter\\nin high concentrations, why would this bitter substance\\nbe something that insects or animals\\nwould want to consume at all?\\nIt turns out that in most plants,\\ncaffeine is present in small enough quantities\\nthat insects and other animals,\\nand in fact, we can't actually taste the caffeine.\\nIf I were to give you a little bit of pure caffeine,\\nyes, it would be a stimulant for you,\\nbut you would say that it tasted awful.\\nIt's in a category of compounds\\nthat would strongly stimulate the bitter receptors\\non your tongue and would make you cringe and pucker\\nand essentially walk away from whatever it is\\nthat contained that caffeine\\nand from the experience that contained that caffeine.\\nWell, in nature, caffeine is present\\nin very low concentrations or is masked by other flavors\\nwithin flowers, beans, and plants.\\nAnd what this paper really points to\\nis that caffeine in nature is acting as a reinforcer\\nfor bees that are consuming different nectar.\\nSo the way that it works is that bees, of course,\\ngo from flower to flower and they are consuming the nectar.\\nThey are bringing nectar and pollen back to the hive,\\nand that provides critical nourishment for the bee colony.\\nThe bees are foraging in a way\\nthat includes information about color,\\nin particular, ultraviolet color,\\nthings that we can't see, but they can see\\nbecause they have different photoreceptors than we do.\\nAnd what this study shows is that plants and nectars\\nthat contain very small amounts of caffeine\\nare the preferred sources of food for bees.\\nAnd the study is beautiful\\nbecause they were able to confirm\\nthat they could mask the caffeine taste\\nso that they know that the bees\\nare not preferring the taste of caffeine.\\nBut what they do is they pair caffeine\\nwith different food sources for the bees,\\nthen they remove the caffeine.\\nAnd what they find is that the bees very strongly\\nprefer flavors that contain caffeine,\\nnot because they could taste the caffeine,\\nbut rather for the way that those caffeine-containing\\nflavors made the bees feel.\\nSo how do those caffeine-containing flavors\\nmake the bees feel?\\nThe same way that they make you and I feel,\\na little bit more alert and thereby able to do more work.\\nFor the bee, the more work is the consumption of more food,\\nwhich then has a further reinforcing effect.\\nSo what we're really talking about here is the fact that,\\nA, caffeine exists in nature, in plants.\\nIt exists in concentrations that are very low,\\nso low, in fact, that they are not detectable\\nto the taste receptors of insects,\\nand in many cases to the taste receptors of humans.\\nAnd of course, there can be high levels of caffeine\\nin a plant, but if the plant also contains compounds\\nthat mask the flavor of caffeine,\\nwell, then those plants are going to essentially\\nbe even stronger reinforcers for the flavor of the plant.\\nOkay, so now we're talking about strong flavors\\nplus strong neurostimulant effects of caffeine.\\nAnd the most important point here is that\\nall of these effects of caffeine are subconscious.\\nIt is not because the bee or you likes the taste of caffeine.\\nIn fact, most people, when they take their first sip\\nof coffee, they find that it tastes bitter\\nand kind of noxious, they don't like it.\\nYou may not even remember that\\nbecause it happened so long ago,\\nand because caffeine is such a strong reinforcer\\nthat very quickly you come to like the taste of coffee.\\nYou might even come to like the feeling\\nof your mug in your hand.\\nYou might even come to like the smell of coffee\\nand so on and so forth.\\nAnd that's because caffeine stimulates the release\\nof certain neurochemicals in the brain,\\nin particular, dopamine and acetylcholine,\\ntwo neuromodulators that increase our focus and alertness\\nand our feelings of wellbeing.\\nA little bit later, I'll tell you that\\ncaffeine stimulates the release of dopamine\\nin a way that's very much distinct\\nfrom the classical dopamine pathway\\nassociated with addiction and reward.\\nIn fact, we can think of caffeine\\nas having a somewhat privileged access to the reward systems.\\nI'll give you a bit of a hint of where this is going.\\nCaffeine stimulates the release of dopamine\\nand acetylcholine not within the classic\\nso-called mesolimbic reward pathway.\\nThat's just fancy nerd speak\\nfor the reward pathways of the brain\\nthat are associated with things like sex and food\\nand drugs of abuse like cocaine and methamphetamine,\\nbut rather caffeine seems to stimulate\\nthe release of dopamine in the parts of the brain\\nthat are associated with alertness and cognition,\\nmeaning the forebrain.\\nThis is very important.\\nWe have multiple dopamine systems in the brain and body,\\nand caffeine seems to stimulate dopamine\\ndirectly within the components of the brain\\nthat are associated with clarity of thought and wellbeing,\\nbut more so clarity of thought.\\nNow, I'm also talking about caffeine as a strong reinforcer\\nin that it makes you feel good overall, and it does,\\nand that suggests that it also taps\\ninto the more classic reward pathway,\\nbut it does that in a very interesting\\nand frankly almost diabolical way.\\nWhen we regularly ingest caffeine,\\nit stimulates the increase in dopamine receptors\\nat multiple sites throughout the brain,\\nbut in particular within the reward pathways of the brain.\\nSo not the areas of the brain that are associated\\nwith focus and clarity of thought and cognition.\\nIt does that, but it is also increasing the level\\nof dopamine receptors in the reward pathway.\\nAnd what that means is that for any dopamine\\nthat's released in response to a positive experience,\\nsocial experience, or any number of the other things\\nthat can stimulate dopamine release,\\nthere are more receptors, more parking spots, if you will,\\nfor that dopamine to arrive at and to exert\\nits increases in mood, increases in motivation,\\nand overall feelings of drive and excitement.\\nSo there are four ways that caffeine works\\nthat we need to understand.\\nFirst of all, caffeine acts as a reinforcing agent.\\nIt increases the probability that you will return to\\nand engage in a certain activity\\nor consume a certain beverage or food.\\nSecond of all, caffeine increases dopamine and acetylcholine,\\nwhich are both neuromodulators in the forebrain,\\nwhich helps us improve our ability to think,\\nto modify our rule sets, that is to adjust our strategies\\nfor different social situations and mental demands\\nand physical demands.\\nAnd third, it increases the number and efficacy\\nof dopamine receptors in the reward pathways of the brain.\\nThat is, it makes things that would feel pretty good,\\nfeel even better.\\nAnd fourth, caffeine acts as an antagonist to adenosine,\\nwhich offsets the sleepiness that we would otherwise feel\\nfrom the accumulation of adenosine that occurs\\nas we are awake for more and more hours throughout the day.\\nSo let's talk first about caffeine as a reinforcing agent.\\nAgain, this was first most beautifully demonstrated\\nin this study on honeybees,\\nwhere the bees prefer nectars that contain caffeine,\\nand that all makes perfect sense\\nin terms of the ecology of bees and flowers\\nthat contain nectar.\\nThere's an advantage, at least in terms of adaptation,\\nthat the flower benefits because of distribution\\nof things from the flower, which is good for the flowers,\\nand the bees benefit because they're getting food.\\nAnd so there's a kind of a symbiosis there.\\nBut with humans, we're consuming caffeine-containing\\nbeverages for our sake.\\nI don't think we have it in mind,\\nnor do the bees have it in mind, frankly,\\nthat we're trying to preserve the plants\\nthat provide the caffeine.\\nI think we would all suffer,\\nor I should say 90% of adults would suffer greatly\\nif all the caffeine-containing coffee and tea plants\\nwere gone, certainly.\\nBut most of us are not consuming coffees and teas\\nand caffeine-containing foods\\nbecause we're thinking about the plants they come from\\nand we want to help those plants.\\nWe're thinking about how we want to help ourselves.\\nAnd yet the point of the reinforcing effects of caffeine\\nare that they are largely subconscious.\\nWe are not aware of them.\\nNow you might say, no, that's not true.\\nWhen I drink caffeine, it makes me feel really good.\\nSo I'm aware that it makes me feel good.\\nIn order to illustrate how reinforcement really works,\\nlet me give you the counter example,\\nwhich would be an aversive agent.\\nSo we have reinforcing agents and we have aversive agents.\\nLet's say that there were compounds in nature\\nthat exist in plants that are aversive.\\nAnd indeed they are.\\nAnd let's say that these compounds were present\\nat such low concentrations that you couldn't taste them.\\nLet's say you wake up in the morning\\nand you go to your refrigerator and you open it up\\nand you are thirsty.\\nAnd so you reach for a nice, you know,\\nrich red-containing beverage in a glass jar.\\nMaybe it looks like cranberry juice\\nor something of that sort,\\nor even a nice clear glass of water.\\nIt looks like a jug of water, a glass of water,\\nand you drink that.\\nTastes fine to you, maybe even tastes great to you.\\nAnd then let's say about 30 minutes later,\\nyou feel a little queasy, you feel a little off.\\nYou feel like going back to sleep.\\nYou just don't feel very good.\\nYou don't know why,\\nbut your nervous system is a predictive machine\\nand it has a process in which it back integrates,\\nor I should say integrates backwards\\ninto your immediate experience\\nthat preceded that not so good feeling.\\nWe can reliably say that there is a much lower probability\\nthat the next day when you wake up,\\nthat you would reach for that same beverage\\nor for that same container even.\\nAnd maybe if you're in a novel environment,\\nmaybe you're staying in an Airbnb or a hotel\\nor something of that sort,\\nyou might even find that you don't really like the kitchen\\nin which you consume that beverage in the first place.\\nAnd then you don't know why.\\nAnd unless you got very, very sick the day before,\\nit's unlikely that you would have such a strong response\\nthat you would entirely avoid, for instance,\\nwater or glass jars containing liquids, et cetera.\\nLet's say you went back to the refrigerator\\nand you consume beverage again\\nand you just didn't feel so well.\\nYou felt less good than you normally would.\\nWell, even without any ability to taste\\nwhat's in that beverage,\\nand even without any understanding\\nof what was happening to you at a conscious level,\\nthere is a very, very high probability\\nthat you will avoid drinking that particular beverage,\\nand certainly at that location\\nand in the same volume in the subsequent days.\\nThat's just the way that aversive agents work.\\nAnd they work by way of activating neurons in the gut\\nthat communicate with areas in the brain\\nthat give us this feeling of queasiness.\\nAnd for some of you hearing this,\\nthat pathway and that association\\nwith times in which you felt queasy\\nand as if you wanted to vomit is so powerful\\nthat you might even be feeling\\nsome of that symptomology now.\\nFor certain people, that's going to be increased salivation\\nwhich precedes vomiting.\\nWe know that there's a class of neurons in the brain\\nrelated to an area called area post tremor\\nthat actually stimulates vomiting.\\nAnd if I keep talking about this,\\nI'll probably feel like I want to vomit.\\nSo I'm going to move on from this in a moment.\\nSo when we ingest caffeine containing beverages and foods,\\nit's the exact opposite scenarios to what I just described.\\nCaffeine as a reinforcer makes us feel slightly better\\nor a lot better in the immediate minutes\\nand hours after we ingest it.\\nSo it's acting as a reinforcing agent,\\nnot just while you're under the effects of caffeine,\\nbut for the things that preceded the ingestion of caffeine\\nwhich is why you return again and again\\nto caffeine containing beverages such as coffee and tea\\nor maybe even foods that contain caffeine,\\neven if the taste of those foods is not something\\nthat you would otherwise consider especially delicious.\\nIn fact, most people when they take their first sip of coffee\\nor tea or other caffeine containing beverage,\\nthey find it to be very bitter\\nand that's not because of the taste of caffeine,\\nit's because of the taste of the beverage itself\\nindependent of caffeine.\\nHowever, when caffeine is present in there,\\nthey come to prefer that taste over most all tastes.\\nIn fact, they will, as I mentioned earlier,\\nwill invest a lot of financial resources\\nand time and energy to make sure that they get that beverage.\\nWhat they're trying to make sure\\nis not that they get that taste,\\nbut that they get the caffeine.\\nIt is that positively reinforcing\\nand the taste therefore takes on new significance,\\nnew meaning and we come to associate it as positive\\nand in fact, most of us, including myself,\\nlove the taste of espresso, love the taste of coffee,\\nlove the taste of yerba mate,\\neven if the initial taste,\\nthe very first time that we consume that beverage\\nwas either neutral or negative\\nand that is all because of the reinforcing properties\\nof caffeine.\\nAnd then of course,\\nthere are the more direct actions of caffeine,\\nthat is the faster actions of caffeine\\nand just to list those off again very briefly\\nso that you have them in mind going forward,\\ncaffeine also increases the release of dopamine\\nand acetylcholine,\\nboth of which are neuromodulators in the forebrain,\\nwhich increases clarity of thought\\nand your ability to rule switch,\\nyour ability to move from one context to another\\nand change and understand the rules of engagement,\\nsocial engagement, physical engagement,\\nmental engagement and so forth.\\nAnd as I mentioned before,\\ncaffeine also increases the number of dopamine receptors\\nin the reward pathway,\\nsuch that any good thing that happens to you,\\nany positive experience that you have\\nwill have a more potent effect\\non your feelings of wellbeing.\\nAnd last but certainly not least,\\ncaffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist.\\nIt reduces your feelings of lethargy and fatigue\\nand your desire to sleep\\nby parking in the receptors for adenosine\\nand not allowing adenosine to have its pro-sleepy,\\nif you will, effects on your brain and body.\\nI'd like to take a quick break\\nand acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.\\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1,\\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\\nthat covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.\\nI've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,\\nso I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the

cetera.\\nAnd they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.\\nAgain, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman\\nto get the five free travel packs\\nand the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.\\nI'd like to just briefly talk about adenosine\\nand some of its molecular features.\\nAnd again, if you don't have a background in biology,\\ndon't worry, I promise to make this very clear to everyone.\\nFirst of all, caffeine is what's called a methylxanthine.\\nIt's a plant alkaloid.\\nThat's why caffeine itself is very bitter.\\nAgain, if I were to give you just the tiniest little bit\\nof pure caffeine, you would find it to be extremely aversive.\\nAnd so these plants that have snuck small enough amounts\\nof caffeine into them or that have masked the flavor\\nof caffeine with other flavors such that bees\\nand humans want to consume them,\\nwhile we don't know what plants think,\\nit does seem very diabolical and very clever\\nin that we are seeking out these caffeine-containing plants,\\nbeverages, and foods, even though caffeine itself\\nis this alkaloid is very, very bitter.\\nMethylxanthine, that is caffeine,\\nbinds to adenosine receptors.\\nAnd there are really two types of adenosine receptors.\\nThere are these so-called A1 receptors\\nand the A2 receptors.\\nAnd they're present in different parts of the brain\\nand body at different levels.\\nWe don't have to get too far into receptor subtypes.\\nMore importantly to understand is that adenosine\\nmakes us feel tired because of the way\\nthat it taps into the ATP pathway.\\nThe ATP pathway is central to energy production\\nand feelings of overall energy in our brain and body\\nin all cells and organ systems.\\nWhen caffeine binds to adenosine receptors,\\nit prevents adenosine from breaking down certain components\\nof the energy production pathway.\\nAnd the net consequence of that is increased cyclic AMP.\\nSo basically, when we ingest caffeine,\\nwe are biasing our system towards the pro-energetic aspects\\nof these cellular pathways.\\nNow, it's really important to understand that in biology,\\neven if you block a receptor\\nor you prevent the activity of an enzyme,\\nand at least in this case,\\nyou end up with more cyclic AMP, more energy,\\nyou're not really getting more energy.\\nYou're actually borrowing energy against an overall system\\nthat is frankly non-negotiable.\\nWhat do I mean by that?\\nWell, let's say that you were to wake up\\nafter six or eight hours of sleep\\nand to drink a lot of caffeine\\nand keep drinking caffeine throughout the day,\\nthroughout the day, blocking those adenosine receptors.\\nYes, you'll offset fatigue.\\nYou'll offset sleepiness\\nbecause that adenosine simply can't function.\\nBut at the point where the caffeine becomes dislodged\\nfrom the adenosine receptors,\\nyou will have a massive glut, a backlog of adenosine,\\nand you will feel extra, extra sleepy.\\nSo really, there's no way\\nto create more energy in your system.\\nReally what you're doing is you're changing the timing\\nin which the sleepy signals\\nand the more energetic signals are arriving.\\nAnd this is really important to understand\\nas the backdrop to the various tools\\nthat we're going to get into next,\\nin which you can use caffeine\\nfor enhancing mental performance and physical performance\\nand other aspects of health.\\nBut it's very important to understand this concept\\nthat when you wake up in the morning,\\nprovided that you slept well enough the night before,\\nyour levels of adenosine will be about as low\\nas they will ever be.\\nActually, in order to get your adenosine levels\\nreally bottomed out,\\nyou want to avoid caffeine\\nin the first 90 to 120 minutes after waking.\\nWe'll talk about why that is\\nbecause it turns out there's a way\\nto completely clear adenosine out of your system\\nin the hour or so after waking.\\nBut for most people, adenosine levels are going to be close\\nto their lowest after a good night's sleep.\\nBut there's really no negotiating the accumulation\\nof adenosine that's going to occur\\nand going to bias you towards feeling more sleepy\\nthan you would otherwise\\nthat's going to occur throughout the day.\\nThere's really no way to eliminate adenosine.\\nAll you can really do is block its function.\\nSo it's sort of like borrowing energy\\nagainst the fatigue that you will inevitably feel.\\nNow, this actually has very important\\nsocio-economical relevance.\\nBefore caffeine was regularly consumed by human beings,\\nwe were really slaves to the light-dark cycle.\\nAnd this was especially true\\nbefore the presence of artificial lighting.\\nBut even before the advent of artificial lighting,\\nhumans were largely constrained\\nto the outside light-dark cycle.\\nWe need to be active during the day\\nand working during the day,\\nand we need to be asleep at night.\\nCaffeine allows us to divorce ourselves\\nfrom that circadian cycle.\\nCircadian just means about 24-hour.\\nCaffeine allows us to do that at least somewhat\\nby way of increasing our alertness,\\nthat is spiking our alertness\\nat various times throughout the day and even at night.\\nThis is how we can have shift workers, for instance,\\nthat can sleep during the day\\nand then drink a strong cup of coffee at 8 p.m.\\nand then work into the night.\\nThat ability completely transformed our society.\\nNow, of course, the healthiest schedule,\\nwe know this with certainty,\\nthe healthiest schedule for brain and body\\nis going to be alert during the daytime\\nand asleep at night.\\nThere's no question about that.\\nShift workers run into all sorts of health problems.\\nAnd thank you, shift workers,\\nfor doing the important work that you do.\\nWe need you, air traffic controllers,\\nparamedics, firefighters, police officers, et cetera.\\nBut we know that there are serious health consequences,\\nnegative health consequences, that is, for shift workers.\\nBut for most people out there,\\nabout 95% of people follow a typical schedule\\nwhere they're awake during the day and asleep at night.\\nAnd yet it used to be before the advent\\nof caffeine-containing beverages,\\nthat if you were sleepy in the afternoon,\\nyou either had to take a nap or battle that sleepiness.\\nThat your activity rhythms and your sleep rhythms\\nwere governed by these circadian changes\\nin availability of sunlight and when you slept.\\nAnd you just didn't have the ability to ingest a beverage\\nthat would increase your levels of alertness\\nbecause you block adenosine.\\nSo this is important to understand that nowadays,\\nwe certainly live in a time in which we use,\\nin fact, 90% or more of adults\\nand half or more of adolescents and teenagers\\nuse caffeine as a way to negotiate with,\\nto borrow against this natural pattern\\nof adenosine making us sleepy.\\nBut again, you're just offsetting the effects\\nof sleepiness that adenosine causes.\\nYou can't eliminate the adenosine entirely.\\nThe important point is that adenosine\\nas a pro-sleepy molecule is a non-negotiable aspect\\nof your biology.\\nIn fact, it's so non-negotiable that every 24 hours,\\nyou are going to release adenosine\\nand you're going to release adenosine\\nin direct proportion to how long you've been awake.\\nSo the longer you've been awake,\\nthe more adenosine circulating in your system.\\nThere are really only a handful of ways\\nto completely clear out adenosine.\\nThe major one being to get sleep.\\nThe other is to take a short nap, which of course is sleep,\\nbut it's shallow sleep or non-sleep deep rest.\\nSo-called NSDR has been shown\\nto reduce levels of adenosine.\\nAnd there are certain things such as\\nviewing morning sunlight,\\nwhich because of its effects on cortisol\\ncan quote unquote clear out adenosine.\\nWe'll talk about this in more detail in a few minutes.\\nAnd there's also evidence that certain forms of exercise\\nprovided that it's brief and intense\\ncan also reduce adenosine, not just block its effects.\\nNow that we've talked about some of the incredible mechanisms\\nby which caffeine changes our experience of life,\\nincreases alertness and mood, et cetera,\\nI want to talk about the use of caffeine as a tool.\\nNow caffeine is a very potent and useful tool\\nfor enhancing mental health, physical health,\\nand performance.\\nBut there are certain considerations\\none has to keep in mind, in particular dose.\\nNow, first off, not everybody will respond\\nto the same dose of caffeine the same way,\\nbut we can reliably say that your body weight\\nis a good measure by which you can estimate\\nwhat a healthy, useful dose of caffeine would be.\\nSo for most people, ingesting one to three milligrams\\nof caffeine per kilogram of body weight\\nis going to be the range in which\\ncaffeine can have positive effects\\nwithout making us feel overly anxious\\nand give us that feeling that we're jumping out of our skin\\nand turn the otherwise positive experience of caffeine\\ninto an aversive one.\\nFor those of you that aren't familiar with thinking\\nin terms of kilograms and normally thinking pounds,\\nI'll just quickly give you some general estimations\\nthat, for instance, 100 kilograms equals 220 pounds.\\nSo for me, I weigh 100 kilograms.\\nThat means that one to three milligrams,\\nagain, milligrams, thousandths of a gram,\\none to three milligrams of caffeine\\nper kilogram of body weight would mean for me,\\nI could safely ingest 100 to 300 milligrams of caffeine\\nin a single dose, in a single drink,\\nif that's the way I'm consuming it,\\nor pill form, if that's the way that I'm consuming it.\\nAnd it's very likely that that will be a tolerable dose.\\nHowever, if you are not somebody that's accustomed\\nto drinking caffeine on a regular basis,\\nI suggest you start on the lower end\\nof that one to three milligrams per kilogram\\nof body weight range.\\nSo for instance, if you're somebody who weighs 50 kilograms,\\nthat's approximately 110 pounds,\\nand you would be pretty comfortable ingesting somewhere\\nbetween 50 and 150 milligrams of caffeine.\\nSo what I recommend is that people\\nwho are considering using caffeine as a tool,\\nor who are already ingesting caffeine,\\nstart to think about the dosage of caffeine\\nthat you are ingesting or plan to ingest,\\nand the timing in which you ingest that caffeine\\nrelative to certain tasks throughout your day,\\nyour waking and your sleep.\\nAnd we'll talk about that in just a moment.\\nBut the first step for you is to figure out\\nhow much you weigh in kilograms,\\nand then to go to that number of one to three milligrams\\nof caffeine per kilogram of body weight.\\nAnd that's a good range in which you might want\\nto explore the use of caffeine in a single application,\\nmeaning in a single dose.\\nNow, I do realize that some people out there\\nare drinking coffee all day long,\\nor having coffee in the morning,\\nand then again in the afternoon.\\nWhat I'm referring to here is the ingestion of caffeine\\nin a single bout, right?\\nOne cup of coffee, or two cups of coffee, for instance,\\nto achieve that 100 to 300 milligram range,\\nif that's what's appropriate for your body weight.\\nBut to avoid any confusion,\\nwhen I talk about dosage of caffeine,\\nwhat I'm really talking about is not the total amount\\nof caffeine ingested per day.\\nI'm talking about the total amount of caffeine ingested\\nin one sitting, or setting, that is.\\nAnd if you're somebody who's drinking caffeine\\nmultiple times throughout the day,\\nyou could imagine, for instance,\\nlet's say the appropriate dose for you\\nin order to get an enhancement in mental performance\\nor physical performance is 200 milligrams,\\nand you are somebody who's doing some work in the morning,\\nand you want to have that lift in the morning\\nto be able to focus better,\\nand you're doing some physical exercise in the afternoon,\\nor vice versa, that you would ingest 200 milligrams\\nof caffeine at two separate times per day,\\nseparated by about four hours.\\nNow, you don't have to separate them.\\nYou could put them two hours apart, for instance,\\nbut we'll talk about half-life of caffeine and so forth.\\nJust keep in mind that if you're ingesting\\n200 milligrams of caffeine,\\nand that's the appropriate dose for you\\nbased on your body weight,\\nand then you are ingesting another 200 milligrams\\nof caffeine an hour later,\\nyou are effectively ingesting approximately\\n400 milligrams of caffeine,\\nwhich is going to start exceeding the dose\\nin which you can normally tolerate\\nwithout feeling anxious and jittery.\\nWith all of that said,\\nthere is a range of tolerance for caffeine\\nthat's based on two things.\\nOne is a pre-existing disposition,\\nthat is whether or not your genetics\\nand nervous system and the backdrop of your life,\\nhow much stress you're experiencing,\\ntends to make you feel more anxious and alert and jittery\\nbefore you ingest any caffeine.\\nAnd the other is how so-called caffeine adapted you are.\\nWe often hear about tolerance.\\nTolerance means something very specific.\\nIt's the ability to ingest more and more of something\\nwith a plateau that is a no increase\\nor an actual reduction in the effectiveness of that thing.\\nBut here, we're not really talking\\nabout tolerance to caffeine.\\nWhat we're talking about is being caffeine adapted.\\nA simple way to understand\\nwhether or not you're caffeine adapted or not\\nis that if you drink caffeine\\nand it tends to increase your heart rate\\nand make you feel more alert and a bit more anxious,\\nthen chances are you are not caffeine adapted,\\nprovided the amount of caffeine\\nis within the healthy range for you, that is,\\nthe ranges we talked about a moment ago.\\nHowever, if you're somebody who drinks caffeine\\nand you actually feel alert and relaxed,\\nchances are you are caffeine adapted.\\nAnd so at various times during today's episode,\\nI'll talk about people who are caffeine adapted\\nand people who are not caffeine adapted.\\nWe'll talk about the use of caffeine every other day.\\nI know for you habitual caffeine drinkers,\\nincluding myself, just the simple mention of that\\nprobably sounds aversive,\\nbut there is actually great utility\\nto using caffeine every other day as opposed to every day.\\nBut just keep in mind that some people will drink caffeine\\nand not get much of a lift from it at all.\\nOther people will drink caffeine\\nand they will feel extremely anxious,\\neven at dosages far lower than that\\none to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight range\\nthat I described a moment ago.\\nSo you have to take into account individual differences.\\nThat said, one to three milligrams of caffeine\\nper kilogram of body weight for a given sitting,\\nfor your morning coffee or your morning yerba mate tea\\nis a good range from which to start.\\nAnd I do encourage you to go online\\nand look up the various beverages and foods\\nthat you might be eating that contain caffeine.\\nFor instance, some people are surprised to discover\\nthat the coffee that they get\\nfrom some of the more standard popular vendors out there,\\nthe small coffee or the medium coffee, for instance,\\ncan contain as much as 400 to 600 milligrams of caffeine.\\nAnd that the large coffee that is often sold\\nat those commercial vendors can contain as much as one gram,\\n1,000 milligrams of caffeine.\\nNow you may be adapted to that\\nsuch that it doesn't make you feel anxious.\\nBut if you wonder why you feel irritable\\nand you get a headache when you don't get that caffeine\\nor that amount of caffeine\\nat precisely the time that you're used to getting it\\neach day, that's because you are consuming\\nquite large quantities of caffeine on a regular basis.\\nSo I do recommend whether or not you drink soda\\nor coffee or tea that you figure out the source of that.\\nOkay, so figure out what vendor you purchase it from,\\nwhat kind of coffee and go online\\nand spend a little bit of time\\nbecause the information is out there\\nto discover what levels of caffeine\\nyou're actually ingesting.\\nNow, if you happen to be ingesting more than one\\nto three milligrams per kilogram of body weight of caffeine,\\nthat's not necessarily bad.\\nHowever, you do want to be careful about ingesting\\nvery high levels of caffeine over long periods of time\\nin your life because there can be issues\\nthat start to arise in particular,\\na bias towards higher levels of anxiety\\nand depletion of certain electrolytes\\nbecause caffeine is a diuretic\\ncan cause you to lose sodium\\nand other things of that sort.\\nAnd also just from simply a dependent standpoint,\\nit does appear that if you ingest high levels of caffeine\\nthat is exceeding the dosages\\nthat normally you could get away with\\nand get just as much mental enhancing\\nand physical enhancing benefits\\nthat you can cause some disruption to the microvasculature.\\nYou can bias yourself towards headaches, anxiety attacks\\nand you can become actually quite irritable\\nwhen you're not getting those higher levels of caffeine.\\nSo I do encourage you to figure out\\nnot just what an appropriate caffeine dosage\\nwould be for you,\\nbut also how much caffeine you might already be ingesting.\\nThe first tool I'd like to talk about\\nis one that I've mentioned before\\non this podcast several times.\\nAnd it's something that if you haven't heard of\\nwill be very useful to you.\\nAnd if you have heard this tool before,\\nI'm going to add some additional features\\nto the description of this tool\\nthat should make this worthwhile for you as well.\\nAnd that is to delay your caffeine intake\\nto 90 to 120 minutes after waking up on most days.\\nAnd I'll be very clear as to days\\nin which you might want to ingest caffeine\\nmore closely to when you wake up.\\nWhy would you want to delay your caffeine intake\\nto 90 to 120 minutes after waking?\\nThe answer to that is very simple.\\nMany people wake up in the morning,\\nthey drink caffeine within 10, 20, 30,\\nsometimes within two minutes of waking\\nand they feel more alert naturally.\\nThat makes sense because of the effects of caffeine\\nin blocking the effects of adenosine\\nthat I talked about earlier\\nand its effects on other neurotransmitter systems.\\nBut then what they find is that in the early afternoon,\\nin particular after lunch,\\nthey experience a dramatic dip\\nin their overall levels of energy,\\nthe so-called afternoon crash.\\nAnd in most cases, the way they respond to that\\nis to ingest more caffeine,\\nwhich indeed can increase their levels\\nof mood and alertness.\\nHowever, as we'll soon talk about,\\nthere is a problem with ingesting caffeine in the afternoon\\nif it falls within eight or 10,\\nor dare I even say 12 hours of going to sleep.\\nAnd that is the caffeine ingested in the afternoon\\nfor most everybody,\\nlet's say for 95 plus percent of people\\ndisrupts the architecture and quality\\nof their nighttime sleep.\\nAnd I should say that it doesn't necessarily\\nimpact their ability to fall asleep\\nand maybe even sleep through the night,\\nbut that the depth and quality of that sleep is disrupted\\nby consuming caffeine in the afternoon.\\nA little bit later, I'll talk about how you can offset\\nsome of those negative effects\\nif you absolutely require caffeine in the afternoon.\\nBut there's a huge advantage\\nto restricting your caffeine intake\\nto the early part of your day,\\nbut not consuming caffeine\\nwithin the first 90 to 120 minutes after waking.\\nIn fact, many people find\\nthat if they delay their caffeine intake\\nto 90 to 120 minutes after waking up,\\nthat they feel more alert in the morning\\nand they completely avoid that afternoon crash.\\nNow that said, many people, including myself,\\ndo need a short nap or non-sleep deep rest\\nor other form of relaxation\\nfor 10 to 30 minutes in the afternoon.\\nThat is natural and healthy.\\nI'm not referring to the need for that\\nwhen I refer to the so-called afternoon crash.\\nWhat I'm talking about in the afternoon crash\\nis an inability to recover energy and focus\\nand a need to consume more caffeine\\njust to make it through the afternoon.\\nBy delaying caffeine intake\\nto 90 to 120 minutes after waking,\\nthere are a couple of things that are accomplished.\\nFirst of all, you offset that afternoon crash\\nand this is an effect that many people experience\\nthe very first time they start delaying their caffeine intake\\nto 90 to 120 minutes after waking.\\nAnd the reason this works so well is the following.\\nAs I mentioned earlier, adenosine is a molecule\\nthat builds up the longer that we are awake.\\nIt is a molecule that is reduced\\nor cleared from our system by sleep.\\nSo when we emerge from sleep,\\nregardless of how long we've slept,\\nour adenosine levels are lower than they were\\nwhen we went to sleep the previous night.\\nIf you slept well enough and long enough,\\nthose adenosine levels can be very, very low,\\nbut they are never completely zero.\\nWhen you wake up in the morning,\\neven if you're one of these people\\nthat springs out of bed and is ready to attack the day,\\nand here I'm certainly not describing myself.\\nI'm not one of those people.\\nI tend to wake fairly slowly.\\nBut if you're one of those spring up and attack the day\\nor you're one of the people\\nwho moves more slowly into your day,\\nregardless, there's still some residual adenosine\\nin your system.\\nAnd it's particularly the case\\nif you did not get enough sleep\\nor enough depth of sleep the night before,\\nthe correct ratios of slow wave sleep\\nand rapid eye movement sleep.\\nAnd for those of you interested in optimizing sleep,\\nI'll just refer you to our master your sleep episode\\nof the Huberman Lab podcast,\\nthe perfect your sleep episode of the Huberman Lab podcast.\\nAnd we have a toolkit for sleep,\\nall of which are available, zero cost, timestamped, et cetera\\nat hubermanlab.com.\\nYou wake up in the morning\\nand your adenosine levels are low, but they're not zero.\\nAnd if you didn't sleep that well\\nor deeply enough the night before,\\nyou're going to have more adenosine in your system.\\nYou might think the logical thing to do\\nis therefore to drink caffeine\\nand to block the adenosine that's there.\\nBut what happens if you do that is there's an accumulation,\\na sort of glut of adenosine that hangs around.\\nAnd then in the afternoon,\\nwhen the effects of that caffeine start to wear off,\\nyou will experience the so-called afternoon crash.\\nAs I mentioned earlier,\\nthere is a way to clear out the adenosine that's present\\nwhen you wake up in the morning\\nand to clear it out essentially completely\\nwithout just blocking its receptors\\nand letting it accumulate or hang around.\\nAnd the way to do that\\nis to deliberately spike your cortisol.\\nNow, many of you have heard of cortisol,\\nthe so-called stress hormone as a bad thing.\\nAnd indeed chronically elevated cortisol is a bad thing.\\nIt depletes your immune system.\\nIt's bad for psychosocial effects.\\nIt tends to make us feel anxious and on and on.\\nBut cortisol itself is not bad.\\nCortisol is wonderful.\\nCortisol enhances the efficiency of the immune system.\\nIt makes us alert and focus.\\nIt stimulates our metabolism.\\nIt does a huge number of positive things\\nprovided that it is released in a circadian fashion,\\nthat is at the appropriate times every 24 hours\\nand that it tends to peak very close to waking.\\nIn fact, one of the reasons you wake up in the morning\\nassuming that you weren't woken up by some noise\\nor sleeping in an environment that's too warm, et cetera,\\nis that your cortisol levels start to rise.\\nAnd shortly after waking,\\nyour cortisol levels will start to reach their peak.\\nAnd when I refer to a cortisol pulse,\\nthat's just biology nerd speak\\nfor a rise and peak in cortisol.\\nYou want that cortisol pulse\\nto occur early in the day close to waking.\\nAnd you want that for a couple of reasons.\\nFirst of all, if you don't restrict that cortisol pulse\\nearly in the day,\\nit will tend to bleed into the later parts of the day.\\nAnd actually a late shifted cortisol peak\\nis one of the hallmark signatures of depression,\\nlow level depression and serious depression.\\nAnd it can start to disrupt sleep\\nand certainly can disrupt mood, metabolism\\nand your immune system.\\nSo you want that cortisol peak early in the day.\\nHow do you ensure that that happens?\\nWell, you wake up in the morning\\nand whether or not you're a bounce out of bed type\\nor you're more groggy,\\nyou know, kind of wade slowly into the day type like I am,\\nyou wake up and you don't ingest caffeine,\\nfine and in fact, beneficial to hydrate\\nwith water and electrolytes.\\nTerrific, in fact, I would say,\\nnecessary to get bright light in your eyes,\\nideally from sunlight.\\nI've talked about this many, many times before\\non the podcast.\\nIf you wake up before the sun comes out,\\nthen turn on bright artificial lights.\\nBut then certainly once the sun is out\\nand even on cloudy days, in fact,\\nespecially on cloudy days,\\nget outside for anywhere from five to 20,\\nmaybe even 30 minutes, do some work outside,\\ntake your breakfast outside.\\nIf you're a breakfast eater, get something done outside,\\neven if it's just to get outside\\nand get bright light in your eyes, why?\\nWell, because it's been shown in studies on humans\\nthat getting bright light in your eyes\\nin the first hour after waking\\nor as soon as possible after waking,\\nincreases the peak of that cortisol pulse by 50%, five zero.\\nAnd that cortisol pulse, yes, increases mood,\\nyes, increases alertness,\\nbut it does one other very important thing,\\nwhich is that through an indirect pathway,\\nit can clear out any residual adenosine\\nthat might be present in your system\\nwhen you wake up in the morning.\\nAgain, this is going to be especially important\\nfor those of you that are not getting as much sleep\\nor as much quality sleep as you would like.\\nIt's going to be very important\\nfor you to get that morning bright light,\\nideally from sunlight, get that cortisol peak going.\\nOther ways to increase that cortisol peak\\nwould be to do some physical activity.\\nIf you don't have time to do a full workout,\\nwell then getting some movement,\\n10 minutes of skipping rope\\nor even five minutes of skipping rope or jumping jacks\\nor walking if that's all you have time for,\\nideally while getting the sunlight in your eyes.\\nBut that's going to zero out\\nthe adenosine present in your system.\\nIf, however, you were to wake up\\nand immediately drink caffeine,\\ncaffeine itself can stimulate the release of cortisol\\na little bit more than it would otherwise\\nbe present in your system.\\nBut by blocking those adenosine receptors\\nand because of the indirect effects of caffeine\\non the cortisol system,\\nyou actually are reducing the clearance of adenosine\\nthat would otherwise occur.\\nSo I realize that's a mouthful.\\nJust to be very clear,\\nif you wake up and you ingest caffeine right away,\\nyou're blocking the adenosine receptor\\nbut you're not clearing it out.\\nYou're also preventing cortisol\\nfrom having its normal increase in rise\\nsuch that it can directly clear out adenosine\\nbecause cortisol can clear out adenosine.\\nAnd that's what you want.\\nYou want to be at maximum alertness and focus\\nin your morning and throughout your day.\\nAnd by delaying your caffeine\\nto 90 to 120 minutes after waking,\\nyou set up your system\\nso that you get that morning cortisol peak,\\nideally a peak that's even greater\\nbecause you're getting your bright light viewing.\\nAnd then when you ingest your caffeine 90 to 120 minutes\\nafter waking,\\nnot only will you be craving it just a little bit,\\nbut you will be drinking that caffeine\\non an already existing backdrop of increased alertness\\nfor two reasons.\\nOne is adenosine is zeroed out\\nand your cortisol peak is higher.\\nAnd so now when you ingest caffeine,\\nyou can actually ingest levels of caffeine\\nthat are a little more reasonable\\nthat almost with certainty are going to fall\\nin this one to three milligrams per kilogram dosage\\nand will allow you to feel really alert\\nand will carry that alertness\\nwell into the afternoon hours\\nwithout the need to drink more caffeine\\nand thereby will prevent you from drinking caffeine\\nand disrupting your nighttime sleep.\\nAnd of course, by getting better nighttime sleep,\\nyou're going to zero out your adenosine even more.\\nSo what I'm describing here are essentially two tools.\\nI'm telling you to get morning sunlight\\nand maybe some exercise in conjunction with that,\\neven if it's brief exercise.\\nBut the main tool of delaying caffeine 90 to 120 minutes\\nafter waking has immediate effects,\\nbut it also sets in motion a cascade or domino falls\\nthat lead to better sleep and more wakefulness\\nthe next night and the next day and so on and so forth.\\nNow I realize there are some people\\nwho just simply cannot or will not delay their caffeine\\n90 to 120 minutes after waking for whatever reason.\\nFirst off, let me say that if you are somebody\\nwho likes to wake up and do very intense exercise\\nwithin the first 90 minutes after waking,\\nwell, in that case, it would be appropriate\\nto ingest your caffeine just prior to doing that exercise.\\nNot a problem, not a problem.\\nBut you should expect that the combination\\nof drinking caffeine very shortly after waking\\nplus exercising very intensely shortly after waking\\nwill increase the intensity of that early afternoon\\nand afternoon fatigue that you feel.\\nNow, for some people, that's a great thing.\\nThey can afford to take a nap or do non-sleep deep rest,\\nstep away from work and so forth.\\nIn that case, I strongly encourage you to do\\nwhatever it is that allows you to get regular exercise\\nbecause regular exercise is going to be very beneficial.\\nIn fact, we did an entire episode called Toolkit for Fitness\\nthat describes a couple of different,\\nbut really one main structure that allows you\\nto get the appropriate amount of resistance training\\nand cardiovascular training and flexibility training\\nthroughout the week.\\nI happen to follow that program\\nand it works very well and it does involve\\nsome of those workouts to come very early in the morning\\nshortly after waking.\\nAnd in those cases, I do ingest caffeine\\njust prior to those.\\nSo within 10, 20 minutes of waking.\\nHowever, on other days,\\nI personally delay my caffeine intake 90 to 120 minutes\\nand I've done that to great benefit.\\nAnd most people, if not all people that try that\\nhave reported the same.\\nI should mention that some people will find getting out\\nto that 90 minutes to be excruciatingly difficult\\nbecause they're so accustomed to ingesting caffeine\\nclose to waking up.\\nIn that case, maybe just push out your caffeine intake\\nby about 15 minutes each day\\nuntil you hit that 90 to 120 minute mark.\\nAnd that will make it much easier.\\nIt might take you a week or so to get there,\\nbut once you get there,\\nyou'll find it to be quite easy to maintain.\\nThe other thing is that if you are somebody\\nwho insists on drinking caffeine very shortly after waking,\\nI would encourage you to drink half of your caffeine then\\nand then the other half of your caffeine\\nabout an hour later.\\nThat also will help offset some of the afternoon crash\\nfor reasons related to the so-called kinetics of caffeine.\\nCaffeine has a quarter life of about 12 hours.\\nThat means that if you were to ingest a cup of coffee\\nat let's say 8 a.m. and let's say 100 milligram coffee,\\njust for sake of simplicity,\\nthat about 25% of that caffeine action,\\nwe wouldn't really say 25 milligrams,\\nbut about 25% of that caffeine action\\nwill still be present at 8 p.m. that night,\\nwhich is pretty remarkable.\\nSo there's a long arc of caffeine effects\\nand this is why it can impede sleep\\nif we take caffeine in the afternoon.\\nBut again, if you're somebody who wakes up\\nand you really need caffeine right away\\nand you refuse to do this 90 to 120 minute delay thing\\nthat I'm talking about, well then in that case,\\nI would drink half of your caffeine upon waking\\nand then a little bit more or the other half\\nabout an hour later,\\nand that will extend the arc of that caffeine effects\\nsuch that you don't need it again in the afternoon\\nbecause you won't experience the afternoon crash.\\nBecause of the way caffeine works,\\nI should mention that if you ingest caffeine\\non an empty stomach,\\nit will have a more potent stimulant effect.\\nThat will also tend to increase the level of jitteriness\\nthat caffeine can produce.\\nLater, I'll talk about ways to offset that jitteriness,\\nbut I'll just tell you one tool now.\\nMany people opt to take 100 milligrams\\nof theanine as a way to offset some of that jitteriness.\\nTheanine will reduce the jitteriness of caffeine,\\nwhich is why many energy drink manufacturers\\nand even some coffee manufacturers\\nare now putting theanine in energy drinks\\nand in ground coffee because, no surprise,\\nit allows people to consume more of that beverage\\nand thereby purchase more of that beverage,\\nwhich is what these vendors want,\\nwithout feeling overly anxious and jittery.\\nSo you can take Pilform Theanine\\nif you want with your caffeine.\\nI don't tend to do that.\\nRather, I control the total dosage of my caffeine.\\nI do tend to consume caffeine on an empty stomach\\nbecause I do restrict my caffeine intake\\nto the early part of the day.\\nAnd I generally eat my first meal somewhere around 11 a.m.\\nAnd then I generally eat my last meal sometime\\naround 8 p.m. or so.\\nThose are averages, I would say, plus or minus an hour.\\nAnd that's not because I'm religiously following\\nany kind of time-restricted feeding.\\nThat tends to work best with my schedule and my appetite.\\nBut again, that's a general theme.\\nThere are days in which I wake up and I'm very hungry\\nand I might ingest something, a small snack or something,\\nor if I'm meeting somebody for breakfast,\\nsometimes I'll have breakfast, sometimes I won't,\\nand so on and so forth.\\nThe point is that you can get away\\nwith drinking less caffeine to get the stimulant effect\\nif you do it on an empty stomach.\\nAnd if you're somebody who likes to exercise\\non an empty stomach, and I'm one of those people,\\nwell then, ingesting caffeine just prior to exercise\\ncan be a fantastic tool.\\nA little bit later, we'll talk about some of the\\nphysical performance-enhancing effects of caffeine,\\nbut I'll just briefly jump to a point about that\\nas we relate to morning exercise.\\nIf you are somebody who regularly ingests caffeine,\\nand we can define regularly by,\\nif you've ingested caffeine every day\\nfor the last two weeks, you're a regular consumer of caffeine.\\nWhereas if you're somebody who only ingests caffeine\\nsomewhere between two and four times per week,\\nwell then, you are not a regular consumer of caffeine.\\nYou're an intermittent user of caffeine.\\nWell, if you're somebody who's a regular user of caffeine,\\nthe performance-enhancing effects of caffeine\\nare going to be most dramatic\\nif you take two or three days off from drinking caffeine,\\nwhich to my mind, I don't want to call myself a caffeine addict,\\nbut a regular caffeine user, that's a horrible notion to me.\\nIt is an aversive notion\\nbecause I do like the effects of caffeine so much.\\nBut if you really want to see the maximum performance\\nenhancing effects of caffeine,\\nyou'll do either one of two things.\\nYou will either abstain from caffeine for a few days\\nor three days prior to ingesting caffeine,\\nor you will use caffeine on an empty stomach.\\nIt's very clear that caffeine on an empty stomach\\nenhances both the mental\\nand physical enhancing effects of caffeine.\\nAnd of course, all of that has to be stated\\non the backdrop of consideration that if you,\\nyou're very, very hungry,\\nit can make it hard to concentrate and so on and so forth.\\nSo I'm not encouraging people to starve themselves\\nby any means, certainly don't do that.\\nBut if you want to maximize\\nthe performance enhancing effects of caffeine,\\nyou will consume it on an empty stomach.\\nAnd then as a final point to that,\\ncaffeine is a diuretic, it causes us to lose fluid\\nand along with that fluid to excrete sodium\\nbecause of the effects of caffeine\\non various processes within the kidney.\\nSo one thing that works very well\\nto maintain mood and alertness,\\nlonger given a certain amount of caffeine intake\\nand to avoid the jitteriness\\nand what can sometimes feel like a crash\\nor low blood sugar feeling or even blurry vision\\nis to make sure that you consume\\nat least an equal volume of water with your caffeine.\\nAnd ideally that water would contain\\nmaybe a small pinch of salt\\nor some sort of electrolyte drink or powder rather.\\nFor me, I use Element, full disclosure,\\nthey are a podcast affiliate and sponsor,\\nbut you don't need to do that.\\nYou could simply just have a glass of water\\nalongside your coffee or espresso or your yerba mate\\nand just put a small pinch of sea salt in that\\nor even just plain table salt.\\nAnd that will help offset\\nsome of the jitteriness of caffeine.\\nA lot of people think that when they ingest caffeine,\\nthey get the jitteriness and crash\\nbecause their blood sugar is low.\\nAnd while that can be the case,\\noftentimes it's simply because of the excretion of sodium\\nthat's occurred when they've ingested caffeine.\\nSo I encourage you to hydrate well\\nand to hydrate with something\\nthat contains a little bit of sodium.\\nObviously not so much that increases hypertension\\nor something of that sort,\\nbut a small amount of sodium or an electrolyte drink\\nlike Element and there are other electrolyte drinks\\nout there that can accomplish the same, of course.\\nJust a couple of quick notes about theanine\\nbecause there are a growing number of products out there\\nthat contain theanine.\\nAnd there's certainly a growing number of people out there\\nwho are using theanine for the effect that I described\\nbefore, which is to offset some of the jitteriness\\nassociated with caffeine containing beverages or foods.\\nAnd of course, I should mention that I've talked about\\nthe effects of theanine on sleep\\nat that sleep toolkit that you can find as a free download.\\nYou don't even have to sign up for anything.\\nYou can just download it from hubermanlab.com,\\ngo to the menu, go to newsletter,\\nyou'll see the toolkit for sleep.\\nYou'll see that the so-called sleep stack\\nthat I use and recommend includes magnesium threonate,\\nsomething called apigenin and theanine.\\nAlthough that sleep stack is designed to be taken\\n30 to 60 minutes prior to sleep.\\nAnd I make the point there and I'll make it again here\\nthat ingesting theanine prior to sleep is not a good idea.\\nIf you are somebody who tends to have very vivid dreams,\\nnight terrors or night sleepwalking, excuse me, et cetera.\\nIn that case, eliminate theanine from the sleep stack.\\nHowever, a number of people are using theanine\\nand products are using theanine to offset jitteriness\\nfrom caffeine containing products during the daytime,\\ndaytime consumption that is.\\nA couple of notes about theanine.\\nTheanine is something that is present in green tea.\\nIt's now been created as a supplement.\\nIt's what's called a non-protein amino acid.\\nSo while there are amino acids in proteins,\\nthere are of course amino acids in non-proteins\\nand theanine is one such non-protein amino acid.\\nTheanine tends to stimulate the so-called glutamate\\nand glutamine pathway.\\nIt's actually very similar to glutamate and glutamine.\\nAnd it has a lot of effects on a lot of different aspects\\nof the nervous system.\\nBut the general effect of theanine is to compete\\nfor the receptors for certain neurotransmitters\\nand the neurotransmitters I'm referring to\\nare all excitatory neurotransmitters,\\nthings like glutamate,\\nand they govern a tremendous amount\\nof our daily thinking and action and feeling, et cetera,\\nbecause they're present at so many connections\\nbetween neurons in the brain.\\nTheanine competes for the receptors for glutamate\\nand tends to reduce our overall levels of alertness.\\nSo really when people take theanine along with caffeine,\\nwhat they're doing is they're really taking a slight,\\nI don't want to call it depressant to the point\\nwhere it misleads people\\nand makes people think that it will make you depressed.\\nThe word is a little bit misleading,\\nbut tends to reduce or blunt some of the more excitatory\\npro alertness actions of neurons in the brain.\\nSo when you take it alongside caffeine,\\ntends to quote unquote even things out a bit.\\nI should mention that the dosages of theanine\\nthat are effective for offsetting the jitteriness of caffeine\\nis 200 to 400 milligrams.\\nAnd the studies that I was able to find\\nshowed that essentially up to 900 milligrams per day\\ncan be safe, but that's a very high dosage of theanine.\\nIn fact, so much so that it might increase sleepiness\\nto the point where it wouldn't feel good.\\nThere are also some positive effects\\nof daytime consumption of theanine\\nthat are independent of reducing the jitteriness of caffeine.\\nFor instance, there's a study demonstrating\\nthat 17 days of ingesting theanine\\nat these 200 to 400 milligram dosage\\nof one to three times per day\\ncan reduce depression and anxiety.\\nThere are also some good data out there\\nshowing that theanine can have positive effects\\non endothelial cells, so blood vessels, capillaries,\\nand so on, and increase some of the function\\nof blood vessels, allowing them to pass more blood\\nthrough them and give them a little bit more elasticity,\\nif you will.\\nSo theanine has certain pro sleep effects\\nif it's taken prior to sleep.\\nIt can enhance the quality, depth, and duration of sleep.\\nAgain, if you're a sleepwalker\\nor somebody who has extremely vivid dreams\\nfrom which you wake up in the middle of the night,\\nprobably best to leave out theanine\\nor maybe reduce the dosage down to 100 milligrams,\\nand if that's still too much, then eliminate it completely.\\nBut theanine can be terrific for enhancing quality,\\ndepth, and duration of sleep.\\nIt can also reduce the jitteriness\\nassociated with caffeine-containing beverages and foods,\\nand it has certain antidepressant\\nand pro-endothelial effects.\\nThat is, it can offset depression, it can offset anxiety,\\nalthough those are minor effects, okay, subtle effects,\\nand it has been shown to improve endothelial cell,\\nthat is, vessel and capillary function and structure,\\nin ways that can be beneficial for both brain and body.\\nNow, one final point about theanine\\nthat's worth paying attention to\\nis that the kinetics of theanine are such\\nthat you don't need to take theanine\\nevery time you ingest a caffeinated beverage.\\nWhen we ingest caffeine,\\nthe peak effects of caffeine occur about 30 minutes\\nafter we drink it,\\nand there I'm assuming one takes it all at once,\\nand this is a key point that we'll come back to later,\\nrather than sipping your coffee slowly\\nover a couple of hours or an hour.\\nIf you drink all 200 or 300 milligrams of caffeine\\nin your coffee, or 600 milligrams of your coffee,\\nif you're getting one of those commercial coffees,\\nand you take theanine along with it,\\ntheanine will block some of the jitteriness\\nand anxiety-inducing effects of caffeine\\nthat can occur for much longer\\nthan the effects that caffeine lasts.\\nSo the peak in theanine occurs\\nabout an hour after ingestion.\\nI suppose if you want to get really fancy\\nand really dial in the kinetics,\\nyou could ingest theanine about half hour\\nbefore you ingest your caffeine,\\nbut I think that's getting a little bit excessive\\nin terms of controlling your micro environment,\\nif you will.\\nI think it would be perfectly fine\\nto take a 100 to 200 milligram capsule of theanine\\nalong with your coffee or tea and so forth,\\nand just realize that if you drink more caffeine\\nor you extend your caffeine intake over several hours,\\nthat you don't necessarily have to take theanine\\nrepeated times throughout the day.\\nI'd like to take a brief

stroke,\\nlet's also talk about some of the myths around caffeine.\\nFor instance, one of the major myths around caffeine\\nis that it can increase osteoporosis.\\nTurns out that while there is a relationship, of course,\\nbetween calcium and osteoporosis,\\nthat is reductions in bone density,\\nand it is the case that caffeine\\ncan extract calcium from certain tissues,\\nthe large scale studies that are out there\\nessentially prove that if people are ingesting\\nenough calcium through their diet, which most everybody is,\\nalthough certainly there are some people\\nthat need to supplement calcium\\nor make it a point to consume more calcium containing foods,\\nbut assuming that you are getting adequate levels of calcium,\\nthere is no direct relationship\\nbetween caffeine intake and osteoporosis,\\nat least not that I'm aware of.\\nI know this was debated for a number of years\\nin the literature,\\nbut the literature seems to have arrived\\nat a general consensus now that caffeine itself\\nis not going to create or exacerbate osteoporosis\\nprovided people are getting enough calcium\\nthrough their diet, that is through foods,\\nthrough supplementation or both.\\nSome of the other myths around caffeine are that,\\nfor instance, caffeine will reduce testosterone levels\\nor will reduce estrogen levels.\\nOther myths out there are in exact opposite to that,\\nthat caffeine will increase testosterone levels\\nin particular free testosterone levels.\\nThere've been some large scale studies\\naddressing the hormone effects of caffeine.\\nThey are a little bit difficult to do.\\nI should just mention that caveat.\\nAnd the reason they are difficult to do\\nis because 90% of adults are consuming caffeine.\\nAnd therefore you can imagine,\\nit's very hard to find a control group\\nto compare the caffeine consumers to.\\nIn particular, a control group that's well controlled\\nfor other things like lifestyle, diet, exercise, et cetera.\\nHowever, when one controls as well as one can\\nfor all the various factors that could impact hormones,\\nwhat one discovers is that caffeine intake,\\nat least at the dosages we talked about earlier,\\none to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight\\nor even up to double that,\\nthat there are no consistent increases or reductions\\nin testosterone or estrogen in men or women\\nthat can be directly attributed to the caffeine intake.\\nAnd I say directly attributed\\nbecause in these association studies,\\none always has to wonder, for instance,\\nif because people are ingesting more caffeine,\\nthey have more energy and therefore exercising more\\nand exercise is known to have effects\\non testosterone, estrogen and other hormones,\\nwhether or not the effects of caffeine\\non those hormones is indirect and so on and so forth.\\nAnd this all just underscores the challenges\\nof doing studies on humans in the wild,\\nin their natural habitat of living,\\nas opposed to an acute study as it's called\\nto bring someone into the laboratory\\nand studying them just for those hours or moments.\\nWith all that said, there does appear to be a relationship\\nbetween caffeine intake and so-called sex hormone\\nand binding globulin, which is a protein present\\nin the body of both men and women\\nthat binds to the sex steroid hormones,\\ntestosterone and estrogen,\\nand prevents them from being in their free or active form.\\nIt has been shown that ingestion of caffeine,\\neven in the sorts dosage ranges that are considered safe\\nand that we've been discussing,\\ncan increase sex hormone binding globulin\\nsuch that it can slightly reduce overall levels\\nof free testosterone and free estradiol in women.\\nNow those effects are relatively minor, but they do exist.\\nIf any of you are interested in reading further\\ninto the effects of caffeine on hormones,\\nI'll just refer you to a couple of studies.\\nWe will link to this in the show note caption.\\nThe title of the study is consumption of caffeinated\\nbeverages and serum concentrations\\nof sex steroid hormones in US men.\\nAnd within this study, there's a reference\\nto a equally sized empowered study done on women,\\nboth of which converged on the same conclusion\\nby examining more than a thousand,\\nso in this case, 1,410 men or more than a thousand women,\\nthat there are increases in sex hormone binding globulin\\nassociated with increased intake of coffee in particular,\\nbut they were able to narrow that down specifically\\nto ingestion of caffeine.\\nSo it's not coffee per se that's causing the increase\\nin sex hormone binding globulin,\\nit's actually caffeine itself.\\nNow, again, the increases in sex hormone binding globulin\\nwere not so significant that at least to my mind,\\nthey seem like a concern,\\nalthough I think that it is worth noting\\nthat if you're going to consume caffeine,\\nthat you'd probably want to consume caffeine\\nin a way that is in dosages and with the sort of timing\\nthat will allow you to get away with ingesting caffeine,\\nbut not to excess.\\nSo to derive the benefits of caffeine without,\\nfor instance, driving up sex hormone binding globulin too far.\\nNow, why would that be a good idea?\\nWhy would you want to make sure\\nthat you have enough free testosterone and free estrogen?\\nWell, some of that is related to the acute effects\\nof those hormones in terms of wellbeing\\nand libido and strength and mood, et cetera.\\nBut some of it is also related to the longer term effects\\nof sex steroid hormones.\\nMany people don't realize this,\\nbut the sex steroid hormones operate on the receptors\\nat the surface of cells to have immediate effects,\\nbut they also can enter cells\\nand actually go into the nucleus of cells\\nwhere the DNA of those cells are contained\\nand control gene expression in those cells.\\nSo the sex steroid hormones, testosterone and estrogen\\nare controlling a lot of different cellular functions\\nover long periods of time.\\nSo blunting their action over long periods of time\\nis probably not a great idea.\\nBut again, at the dosages of caffeine\\nthat we're talking about today,\\none to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight,\\nunlikely that the increases in sex hormone binding globulin\\nthat one experiences from that are going to be detrimental.\\nAnd certainly the positive effects of caffeine\\nthat one experiences in terms of mental performance\\nand physical performance,\\nand the fact that it increases energy\\nto do the sorts of things like exercise\\nthat we know can profoundly improve hormone profiles.\\nTwo-fold or three-fold improvement in hormone profiles.\\nIn that case, it seems that ingesting caffeine\\nis overall a good thing, provided it's not in excess.\\nThat also makes this the appropriate time to mention\\none of the more impressive effects of caffeine,\\nwhich is on overall levels of mood and mental health.\\nThere are several studies on this,\\nbut the one that I'm particularly fond of\\nwas published in 2019 in Psychiatry Research,\\nand the title of the paper is\\nInverse Association Between Caffeine Intake\\nand Depressive Symptoms in U.S. Adults.\\nAnd these are data from the National Health\\nand Nutrition Examination Survey.\\nAnd the basic takeaway is that while, of course,\\nthere are a ton of different factors\\nthat are going to relate to whether or not\\npeople are depressed or not,\\nlife circumstances, genetics, and so on,\\nthat, and here I'm quoting from the study,\\ncaffeine's psychostimulant properties,\\nthat just means the ability to make us feel more alert\\nand positive, appear to protect against depressive symptoms.\\nAnd, of course, they acknowledge\\nthat additional studies are needed.\\nBut this is just one of several studies\\npointing to the fact that people who regularly\\ningest caffeine in the appropriate dosages\\ndo seem to enjoy an anti-depressive effect overall.\\nI wouldn't want anyone to consider caffeine\\na treatment for severe depression,\\nor at least not alone a treatment for severe depression.\\nBut provided the anxiety-inducing effects of caffeine\\ncan be kept in check through use of theanine\\nor making sure that the dosage\\nand the timing of caffeine ingestion is correct,\\nthen caffeine overall seems to be good for our mood\\nand prevent depression, or at least keep depression at bay\\nwhen depression might otherwise surface or be more severe.\\nAnd, of course, there are the don'ts\\nsurrounding caffeine intake.\\nAs it relates to sleep, and to put it very simply,\\nsleep, that is getting enough quality sleep each night,\\nis the foundation, it is the bedrock of mental health,\\nphysical health, and performance.\\nSleep and the power of sleep far exceeds\\nany nootropic you could ever take,\\nany prescription drug you could ever take,\\nany health-promoting tool for your immune system,\\nyour metabolism, your mental function,\\nyour physical function you could ever take.\\nSleep is the bedrock.\\nI know a lot of people experience challenge with sleep.\\nNobody is perfect about sleep.\\nThat's important to keep in mind.\\nI think a good goal is to get enough quality sleep\\nof sufficient duration, 80% of the nights of your life,\\nand then as much as possible to make sure\\nthat the remaining 20% of nights,\\nyou're not getting enough sleep for good reasons,\\nas opposed to hard reasons.\\nGood reasons would include raising children.\\nThat's important.\\nAfter all, every species desires to make more of itself\\nand to preserve and extend the wellbeing of its young.\\nSo child rearing is a perfectly legitimate reason\\nto get a lack of sleep,\\nbut you really want to strive to get quality sleep\\nmost nights of your life,\\nwhich means that even if you're somebody\\nwho can quote unquote drink an espresso\\nand then fall right asleep,\\nthat you avoid caffeine intake\\nin the 12 hours prior to sleep.\\nI realize not everyone will be able to do that.\\nIn fact, I sometimes violate that.\\nSo I tend to go to sleep around 10 p.m. every night,\\nsometimes 11, occasionally 12 midnight,\\nbut usually around 10 p.m. every night.\\nI confess that my last ingestion of caffeine\\nis not always 10 a.m. or prior to that.\\nSo sometimes I will have caffeine up until 11 a.m.\\nor maybe noon, and very, very rarely I'll have an afternoon\\ncoffee or espresso or non calorie containing soda\\nor tea or something of that sort.\\nBut I really try to restrict my caffeine intake\\nto the early part of my day, that is before noon,\\ngiven that I go to sleep around 10 p.m. each night.\\nAnd I strongly encourage everyone out there\\nto try and limit their afternoon caffeine intake.\\nThis is something that Dr. Matt Walker,\\nwho's an expert sleep researcher\\nout of University of California, Berkeley,\\npsychology and neuroscience department there,\\nauthor of the incredible book, Why We Sleep.\\nHe's been on this podcast, many other podcasts\\ntalking about the importance of sleep.\\nHe will remind us, and I'll remind you now,\\nthat the quarter life of caffeine is 12 hours.\\nI mentioned this earlier, but I'm going to repeat it again.\\nAnd that means that if you ingest caffeine at noon,\\n25% of its effects, more or less, okay,\\nI'm using broad stroke here to talk about quarter life,\\n25% of that is still going to be bioactive\\nat midnight that night,\\nwhich will disrupt the early phase of your night,\\nthe amount of slow wave sleep,\\nwhich then in turn will disrupt\\nthe amount of rapid eye movement sleep,\\nwhich will disrupt your emotional processing\\nduring the following day and so on and so forth, okay?\\nNone of this is to say that if you have the occasional\\ncup of coffee in the afternoon,\\nthat's going to completely demolish\\nyour sleep wake cycle forever.\\nBut I really encourage people to avoid drinking caffeine\\nin the 12 hours prior to sleep.\\nAnd if you can't do that within the 10 hours\\nprior to sleep, and if you can't do that\\nwithin the eight hours prior to sleep,\\nso really try and limit your caffeine intake\\nin the eight to 12 hours prior to going to sleep at night.\\nAnd of course, slow wave sleep, AKA deep sleep,\\nis the sleep that's associated\\nwith somewhat mundane dreams,\\nwhich makes it sound like it might not be that important,\\nbut it's also the sleep that's associated\\nwith growth hormone release,\\nwhich is important for protein synthesis,\\nrepair of all bodily tissues and metabolism,\\nand slow wave sleep is also critically attached\\nto your immune system's ability\\nto clear out bacteria and viruses\\nthat might otherwise infect your tissues.\\nNow I'd like to talk about caffeine and performance,\\nand that includes both mental performance\\nand physical performance.\\nNow I'd like to talk about caffeine\\nand its positive effects on performance when used correctly.\\nAnd here we are referring to both mental performance\\nand physical performance.\\nThe exploration of caffeine as a pro-performance tool\\nhas been explored since the 1930s,\\nat least that's some of the earliest\\ndocumented literature on this.\\nAlthough I have to imagine,\\ngiven that people have been using caffeine\\nfor much longer than that,\\nthat long ago somebody realized\\nthat by ingesting a certain plant,\\nthat they felt much more alertness\\nand were able to hunt and gather\\nor do any number of different things better,\\nand as a consequence,\\ndecided to consume more of that plant.\\nNow, these days we consume a lot of caffeine\\nin the form of coffee and tea mainly,\\nand some people consume it in the form of caffeine tablets\\nor energy drinks, et cetera.\\nAcross the board, one finds that caffeine intake\\nat a level of one to three milligrams per kilogram\\nof body weight improves reaction time.\\nThat is, it reduces the amount of time\\nto take a physical action\\nor to answer a question correctly\\nwith a verbal response.\\nIt can also improve coordination,\\nit can also improve memory,\\nalthough I do want to mention that\\nwhereas most studies of the effects of caffeine\\non improving mental and physical performance\\ninvolve taking caffeine at one to three milligrams\\nper kilogram of body weight\\nbefore the mental task or physical task,\\nthere is also a pro-performance effect of caffeine on memory\\nif one takes caffeine after learning certain material,\\nor I should say being exposed to certain material.\\nWe'll come back to that in a few minutes.\\nIf one examines reaction time, mood, alertness,\\nfocus and memory,\\nor the ability to call up information from memory\\nor physical dexterity, power output, endurance,\\nand overall feelings of wellbeing\\nduring exercise and exertion,\\ncaffeine has been shown in numerous studies\\nin both men and women\\nto improve all of those metrics significantly.\\nSo this is all just to say that caffeine\\nis an incredible performance enhancing tool.\\nNow, what's not obvious from the statement\\nthat caffeine is a performance enhancing tool\\nacross the board and in men and women\\nand in different contexts\\nis that the way in which caffeine is taken\\nis very important.\\nBecause 90% or more of adults consume caffeine,\\nfinding controls for studies of caffeine\\nis really challenging.\\nThat is finding people who don't ingest caffeine regularly\\nis a very challenging task for the researcher.\\nAnd as a consequence,\\nmany of the studies of caffeine on human beings\\ninvolve depriving regular caffeine users of caffeine\\nand then examining the effects of caffeine\\ngiven after a period of say five to 15 days of abstinence\\nin a person that is essentially experiencing\\nmild withdrawal symptoms\\nbecause they haven't had the caffeine\\nthat they were used to getting.\\nSo this is an important point.\\nAnd it's a point that likely exacerbates\\nthe observed pro-performance effects of caffeine.\\nNow, all of that isn't necessarily a problem\\nprovided you keep it in mind.\\nAnd it actually points to a way in which\\neven if you're a regular caffeine user,\\nyou can extract more of the benefits of caffeine.\\nThe simplest way to do this, for instance,\\nis to look back to what we talked about earlier\\nin terms of the need to have\\nmost of your cortisol increase restricted\\nto the hour or hours just after waking\\nin terms of mood and alertness and performance.\\nOne of the ways to increase the peak of that cortisol\\nearly in the day is to consume caffeine\\nshortly after that peak occurs.\\nAnd this was really nicely demonstrated\\nin a study entitled caffeine stimulation\\nof cortisol secretion across the waking hours\\nin relation to caffeine intake levels.\\nWe will provide a link to this study.\\nIt's a somewhat complicated study\\nbecause they looked at a bunch of different\\ntimes of day for caffeine intake.\\nAnd I should mention this study,\\nthey use this 300 milligrams per day\\nor 600 milligrams per day.\\nSo that's quite high,\\nalthough for people of sufficient body weight\\nand who are accustomed to taking caffeine,\\nit's certainly not going to be in excess\\nof what a lot of people out there are taking.\\nBut basically what they observed was the following.\\nCortisol responses to caffeine are reduced,\\nbut not eliminated in people who consume caffeine\\non a daily basis.\\nWhat this means is that if you wake up\\nand as I recommended earlier,\\nyou avoid drinking caffeine for the first 90\\nto 120 minutes after waking,\\nbut you do get some sunlight\\nor other bright light in your eyes in that time,\\nmaybe even get some exercise in that time,\\nwhich would be even better.\\nAnd then you ingest caffeine,\\nyou will get a further increase in cortisol,\\nwhich provided it's restricted to the early part of the day\\nis a good thing overall for mood and alertness.\\nSo this is a simple performance enhancing tool,\\nwhich is to stack caffeine on the tail\\nof that early cortisol peak.\\nI should also mention, however, that in this study,\\nthey had people do a five-day caffeine abstinence\\nprior to being tested with 300 milligrams\\nor 600 milligrams of caffeine.\\nSo the simple tool to extract from this\\nand other studies like it,\\nis that if you want to experience\\nthe maximum alertness promoting effects of caffeine,\\nwhen you ingest it early in the day,\\nyou would abstain from caffeine for five days\\nand then ingest caffeine 90 to 120 minutes after waking.\\nI would still hope that you were doing all the other things\\nthat I described, morning, sunlight, exercise,\\net cetera, correctly,\\nbut regardless, it's very clear\\nthat a five-day abstinence from caffeine,\\nhowever painful that might be,\\nwill increase the performance enhancing effects of caffeine\\nwhen you take caffeine on that sixth day.\\nNow, I'm sure many of you out there are saying,\\nwhy would I ever want to abstain from caffeine\\nfor five days in order to just get this six-day\\nperformance enhancing effect?\\nWell, there are a couple of reasons for doing that.\\nPerhaps you're planning to travel to a new time zone\\nand you want to use caffeine as a stimulant\\nto stay up during the day in the new time zone.\\nThat's a somewhat unusual case.\\nOthers of you might be interested\\nin the pro-physical performance effects of caffeine.\\nWe'll talk more about these in a little bit,\\nbut you want to get the maximum strength increase\\nor the maximum endurance increase from ingesting,\\nin this case, 300 to 600 milligrams of caffeine.\\nWell, in that case, abstaining from caffeine for five days\\nwill greatly exacerbate the pro-performance effects\\nof caffeine when you take it on that sixth day.\\nAlthough, admittedly, those five days\\nare likely to be pretty painful\\nif you're a regular caffeine user.\\nAnother variation on this, however,\\nmight be to have the amount of caffeine\\nthat you ingest on a daily basis\\nand then go back to your regular level of caffeine intake\\non that day in which you need the caffeine\\nto really boost your mood, energy, and performance.\\nAnother reason why you might want to abstain from caffeine\\nor reduce your caffeine intake for a period of time\\nand then go back to your regular caffeine intake\\nis simply to identify how much of an effect\\ncaffeine is really having on your overall level\\nof daily functioning and mood.\\nThis was something that was actually covered\\nin beautiful detail in a book by Michael Pollan,\\nAll About Caffeine.\\nIt's available on Audible.\\nI really enjoyed that book.\\nIt describes his experience with the decision\\nto completely abstain from caffeine for a period of months.\\nAlthough, I confess that after hearing that book,\\nwhat it basically made me want to do\\nis never quit drinking caffeine\\nbecause it sounded as if, at least my interpretation was,\\nthat even after several weeks or months\\nof abstaining from caffeine,\\nthat he still fantasized about the effects of caffeine.\\nBut he did mention that when returning to ingesting caffeine\\nafter a period of long abstinence,\\nthat it had almost a,\\nlet's not call it a psychedelic property,\\nbut it had such obvious effects on mood and alertness\\nand feelings of wellbeing\\nthat it really highlighted for him\\nthe extent to which caffeine normally was allowing him\\nto just function what he thought was normally.\\nSo in other words, many of us don't even really know\\nwhat our normal basal level of cognitive\\nand physical functioning is\\nbecause we're ingesting caffeine on such a regular basis.\\nI confess that as much as I enjoyed that book\\nand as intriguing as his description of caffeine abstinence\\nand then the return to caffeine was,\\nI don't intend to ever find out personally.\\nNow, a very good reason why you might want to abstain\\nfrom caffeine for a deliberate period of time\\nand then return to caffeine intake\\nis for its physical performance enhancing effects.\\nAnd here we can look to a really interesting study,\\ntitle of which is Time Course of Tolerance\\nto the Performance Effects of Caffeine.\\nAnd what I like about this study is that while yes,\\nit does say that abstaining from caffeine\\nand then returning to caffeine intake\\ncan enhance physical performance in a very specific way.\\nIt also says that if you take caffeine regularly,\\nyou can still see the physical performance\\nenhancing effects of caffeine,\\nalthough they are not quite as robust\\nas they would be had you abstained from caffeine.\\nThe design of the study is pretty straightforward.\\nThey had people either ingest three milligrams\\nper kilogram of caffeine for 20 consecutive days.\\nMany people are already doing that, I realize,\\nbut they had people do that\\nor ensure that they were doing that\\nor others ingested a placebo for 20 days.\\nSo they abstained from caffeine without realizing it.\\nThen after that 20 days\\nof either ingesting caffeine or a placebo,\\ntheir peak performance was measured\\nin terms of aerobic output,\\nbut prior to that measurement, they had caffeine, okay?\\nSo it's 20 days of caffeine and then a 21st day of caffeine\\nand then the physical task on that 21st day,\\nor it's 20 days of abstinence from caffeine.\\nAnd then on day 21, you get caffeine\\nand you get the same physical test.\\nAnd what they discovered was that the ingestion of caffeine\\nincreased peak performance in this aerobic output\\ndramatically if people had abstained from caffeine,\\nbut for people that had consumed caffeine\\nall the way through up until that day,\\nit still was effective to ingest caffeine on day 21,\\nbut not as effective as it would have been\\nhad they abstained.\\nAnd in fact, the magnitude of the,\\nwhat they call ergogenic effect,\\nwhich is the pro-performance enhancing effect of caffeine\\nwas higher on the first day than in subsequent days\\nwhen they allowed people to continue caffeine intake.\\nSo the takeaway from this study is really straightforward.\\nIf you want to get the maximum physical performance\\nenhancing effects of caffeine,\\nyou abstain from caffeine for 20 days.\\nThen on day 21, when you're going to do the physical thing,\\nthe task, you ingest caffeine about 30 minutes\\nto an hour before you do that physical challenge.\\nNow, 20 days of abstinence is going to be rough\\nfor a lot of people.\\nThey certainly don't want to sign up for this study,\\nin which case you might want to do five days of abstinence\\nas we talked about before.\\nAnd then on day six is the day that you ingest caffeine\\nand do the physical task.\\nThere are even some studies showing\\nthat you can abstain from caffeine for just two days,\\nfor just 48 hours.\\nAnd in particular, if you are a regular user of caffeine,\\nthis allows you to on day three,\\ningest caffeine at the dose that's appropriate for you\\nand do the physical or I should mention\\nmental performance task and perform significantly better\\nthan those that have been taking caffeine\\nthroughout the entire period leading up to the challenge.\\nSo you don't necessarily need to abstain for 20 days\\nin order to get the pro performance effects\\nof caffeine on day 21.\\nYou could do five days of abstinence prior\\nor even two days of abstinence prior.\\nOr if that's intolerable to you,\\nas it is in my mind to me,\\nto just reduce your caffeine intake slightly\\nor even perhaps have it, if you can tolerate that\\nin the week or two weeks or maybe even three weeks\\nproceeding some physical or mental challenge.\\nNow, again, this sort of implies\\nthat you're going up against a marathon\\nor you're going up against a series of long tests,\\nmaybe standardized tests in one day.\\nThere, I just really want to point out\\nthat there is an abundant literature showing\\nthat people perform best on mental tests\\nif they are in the state that they were\\nwhen they studied for that material.\\nNow in college, I knew a number of people\\nwho took this to the extreme thinking\\nthat if they were to study under the effects of alcohol\\nthat they would be best off consuming alcohol\\nprior to taking exams.\\nAnd it turns out to not be the case.\\nHere, we're talking in particular\\nabout psychostimulant effects of caffeine\\nand other compounds.\\nSo don't think that you can drink\\nor be under the influence of THC\\nand then take when you study and then take an exam\\nunder the same influence and do just as well as you would\\nhad you not ingested anything.\\nPlease don't let that be the takeaway.\\nHowever, do let it be the takeaway\\nthat caffeine's effects are made more potent\\nby a brief to not so brief period of abstinence\\nprior to taking a dosage of caffeine.\\nAnd then the final point to make\\nis that if you are somebody who is not accustomed\\nto drinking caffeine, meaning you're hypersensitive to caffeine\\nor you don't regularly ingest caffeine,\\nplease do not ingest caffeine on the day\\nof any important mental or physical challenge\\nor performance because what you will find\\nis that because you are not caffeine adapted,\\nyou will experience changes in your thermal regulation,\\nin your levels of anxiety and jitteriness\\nand your levels of focus that could be very detrimental\\nto mental or physical performance.\\nSo you don't want to throw yourself in the deep end\\nby ingesting caffeine if you're not used to it.\\nAnd I should mention that for people\\nthat are not accustomed to ingesting caffeine\\nor are very sensitive to caffeine,\\neven 25 to 50 milligrams of caffeine\\nin the amount that's found in, for instance,\\na piece of certain types of chocolate\\ncan actually cause anxiety.\\nSo be careful there.\\nHere I'm referring only to people\\nthat are accustomed with caffeine intake.\\nSo what I recommend is to explore\\nthe ergogenic effects of caffeine during your training\\nand then to make a decision about what you can reasonably\\nand reliably do in terms of abstinence\\nand then pulse with caffeine on the day of the challenge.\\nI get a lot of questions as to whether or not caffeine\\nhas different effects on the nervous system\\nand on performance in particular,\\ndepending on phases of the menstrual cycle.\\nSo I explored that in my research for this episode\\nand I found two studies,\\nboth of which we will reference in the show note captions.\\nThe first one is entitled\\nCaffeine Consumption and Menstrual Function.\\nSo it's actually the relationship\\nbetween caffeine and menstrual function.\\nWe will do an entire episode\\nabout the menstrual cycle and menstrual function.\\nBut the other one, as it relates to performance,\\nwas published in 2020 in the European Journal of Nutrition,\\nwhich is Ergogenic Effects of Caffeine\\non Picarobic Cycling Power During the Menstrual Cycle.\\nAnd the basic takeaway of this study,\\nthis is frankly a very nice study,\\nshowed that, quote,\\ncaffeine increased peak aerobic cycling power\\nin the early follicular, pre-ovulatory,\\nand mid-luteal phases of the menstrual cycle.\\nThus the ingestion, and again here,\\nthey use three milligrams of caffeine\\nper kilogram of body mass,\\nmight be considered an ergogenic aid\\nfor women who are in the menstrual cycle\\nduring all three phases of their cycle.\\nSo keep that in mind, women,\\nfor those of you that are regular users of caffeine\\nor you're using caffeine to enhance physical performance,\\nthere does not seem to be any menstrual cycle\\nphase-dependent effects of caffeine on performance.\\nThat is, caffeine seems to always increase\\nphysical performance,\\nregardless of the phase of the menstrual cycle\\nyou might happen to be in.\\nI'd like to touch on a little bit more\\nof the use of caffeine for enhancing mental performance.\\nYes, it is the case that ingesting\\none to three milligrams of caffeine\\nper kilogram of body weight\\nin the 30 minutes or so prior to doing a memory task\\nor sitting down to doing some studying\\nor learning of any kind,\\nphysical or mental performance of any kind,\\nis beneficial for all the reasons we talked about before\\nrelated to dopamine and acetylcholine, et cetera.\\nBut it turns out that it is also the case\\nthat spiking one's adrenaline\\nand other so-called catecholamines,\\nso this would be dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine,\\nafter a bout of learning,\\ncan greatly enhance memory for the information\\nthat one was trying to learn.\\nThat's right.\\nSpiking your adrenaline after learning\\ncan greatly increase memory\\nfor the material you're trying to learn.\\nIn fact, this is a practice that dates back centuries\\nand was written about in a beautiful annual review\\nof neuroscience on the biology of memory by James McGaugh,\\nwhere he talks about medieval practices\\nof children being taught information\\nand then being thrown literally into cold water\\nto stimulate the release of adrenaline.\\nAnd that increase in adrenaline,\\nwhile the mechanism wasn't completely understood,\\nit was understood that that sort of shock to the system\\nfrom the cold water led to better memory\\nand retention of the information\\nthat these children had been exposed to.\\nAnd it turns out the exact same thing is true for adults\\nin the laboratory or kids in the laboratory.\\nAnd here I'm not suggesting throwing anyone into cold water.\\nIf you want to get into cold water,\\nthere's a reason we call it deliberate cold exposure\\non the podcast is that it should be deliberate\\nand controlled by you, not by somebody else.\\nIf it's controlled by somebody else,\\nthat might be military screening or something.\\nBut here we're talking about deliberately increasing\\nyour levels of adrenaline and other catecholamines,\\ndopamine, norepinephrine, et cetera.\\nYou can do that certainly by deliberate cold exposure\\nwith a cold shower or getting in up to your neck\\nin cold water of any kind.\\nBut the other way to do that is to spike your adrenaline\\nby ingesting one to three milligrams per kilogram\\nof caffeine after sitting down\\nto try and learn some material.\\nI confess that more often than not,\\nI use caffeine the same way that most people use it,\\nwhich is, okay, I'm going to sit down,\\nI'm going to research information for a podcast\\nor assemble some information for a paper or grant.\\nAnd I want to focus, so I will drink a cup of coffee\\nat the beginning of that and maybe even throughout that\\nor a couple of yerba mate at the beginning\\nor throughout that, or I'll sip on one or both\\nthroughout trying to learn.\\nAnd that works quite well in terms of maintaining focus\\nand alertness and retention of information.\\nBut it is indeed the case,\\nthat is the research supports the fact,\\nand I've experienced the fact that if I abstain\\nfrom caffeine while I'm trying to learn something,\\nbut then I drink caffeine immediately after.\\nSomewhat surprisingly to me,\\nbut certainly in a way that's consistent\\nwith the research literature,\\nmemory for the information that I was focused on\\nprior to ingesting that caffeine is much greater.\\nAnd here I'm talking about it as a personal anecdote,\\nbut this is actually what the data point to\\nboth in animals and in humans.\\nAnd if you think about it, it makes perfect sense\\nbecause the way that the memory systems\\nof the brain are organized is that\\nwe go through life experiencing things,\\nwe encounter surprises, both good and bad.\\nWe go through the motions of things,\\nboth typical, mundane, exciting and novel and not novel.\\nAnd then every once in a while,\\nsomething will happen that will spike our catecholamines,\\ndopamine, typically if it's a positive surprise,\\nadrenaline, which can be associated\\nwith both positive surprise or positive events\\nand negative events or surprises.\\nAnd without fail, increases in the catecholamines\\ntend to lock in memories for things that preceded\\nthe increase in those catecholamines.\\nAgain, the catecholamines being dopamine,\\nepinephrine and norepinephrine,\\nsometimes all three in combination,\\nsometimes just two of those,\\nsometimes just one of those depending on the experience.\\nSo it makes perfect sense that using caffeine\\nat the end of a learning bout would enhance our memory\\nfor the information that we're trying to learn.\\nSo if you decide that you want to try\\nand extract this performance enhancing effect of caffeine,\\nwhat I recommend would be to try and abstain from caffeine\\nfor a day or two prior.\\nBut if you can't,\\nto just continue with your normal caffeine intake.\\nBut then when you sit down to study or learn something\\nto not ingest any caffeine as you do that,\\nbut then afterward to ingest caffeine.\\nNow, in theory, you could probably further enhance\\nthe memory encoding effects of adrenaline\\nand the other catecholamines by drinking caffeine\\nand then taking a cold shower,\\ndoing deliberate cold exposure if you really wanted to\\nor had the ability to,\\nor doing some sort of intense form of exercise.\\nAnd we'll talk in a moment about how caffeine exercise\\nand the adrenaline system interact.\\nBut as a brief but relevant aside,\\nbrief bouts of intense exercise\\nranging from 10 to 50 minutes or so\\nhave been shown to improve memory for information\\nthat one was trying to learn prior to the intense exercise.\\nThis is work from Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab at NYU\\nas well as other laboratories.\\nSome of the work that's being done at Stanford\\nin the mind body laboratories.\\nAnd our laboratory points in the direction\\nof these kinds of effects as well.\\nThey all come back to the same general neurochemical theme,\\nwhich is that when we experience an increase\\nin these catecholamines that include adrenaline,\\ndopamine and norepinephrine,\\nthe memory systems of the brain flip on\\nin a way that try to capture the information\\nand the perceptions and the experiences\\nthat we were exposed to just prior\\nto the increase in catecholamines.\\nAnd caffeine, but also exercise and also cold water.\\nAnd of course, any of those alone or in combination\\nall increase the levels of catecholamines.\\nSo it makes perfect logical mechanistic sense\\nas to why this would work.\\nAnd in fact, it does work.\\nIf you want to remember specific information,\\nyou might consider using caffeine\\nas you move through and absorb\\nand are exposed to that information.\\nBut you might also consider using caffeine\\nafter being exposed to that information\\nbecause studies in animals and humans show\\nthat that is a potent way to increase memory\\nfor what you were just exposed to.\\nI should mention that what I just described\\nalso pushes back on something that I know\\na number of people perhaps have heard about\\nand maybe even use, which is this notion of the nappuccino.\\nI remember hearing about this a few years back.\\nIt was a sort of trend, if you will.\\nThe trend involved drinking a cup of coffee\\nor double espresso and then going down for a nap,\\ntypically in the afternoon and then waking up.\\nAnd the idea was that the caffeine would hit your system\\nright at the time that you awake from the nap\\nand that you would be better able to focus and exercise.\\nThere are a couple of things about that practice\\nthat I don't like.\\nFirst of all, it implies in most cases\\nthat you're napping and ingesting caffeine\\nin the afternoon, which I realize for many students\\nand for people that are comfortable staying up\\nuntil the wee hours of the night\\nand then waking up late the next day\\nmight be compatible with their schedule.\\nBut again, because of the sleep diminishing effects\\nof caffeine, and we talked about earlier,\\nnot crazy about the idea of people ingesting caffeine\\nin the late afternoon in order to perform better\\nin the late afternoon, far better would be\\nto restrict caffeine intake to the early part of the day\\nas we talked about earlier.\\nThe other reason is that the data on things\\nlike non-sleep deep rest and naps in the afternoon.\\nAnd again, the rule here is that you don't have to nap,\\nbut if you want to nap, it's been shown that naps\\nof 90 minutes or less or non-sleep deep rest protocols.\\nAnd you can find those, for instance,\\nthere's one with me speaking.\\nYou just put NSDR Huberman into YouTube.\\nYou can hear that it's completely zero cost.\\nThere are other NSDR scripts out there now, of course,\\nif you prefer those.\\nThat those can all lead to increases\\nin one of the catecholamines at least, which is dopamine.\\nThat's been shown in a really nice neurotransmitter\\nlabeling study, not from my laboratory,\\nbut from another laboratory,\\nbut also can improve mood focus and alertness on its own\\nwithout the need to ingest caffeine prior\\nto going into those states.\\nAnd in fact, ingesting caffeine prior to a nap\\nor ingesting caffeine prior to NSDR is most certainly\\ngoing to reduce the effectiveness of that nap and NSDR\\nin restoring natural levels of alertness and focus\\nthat would lead to the performance enhancing effect.\\nSo I'm not such a fan of the so-called nappuccino,\\nalthough if any of you out there\\nhave derived great benefit from it,\\ndefinitely let me know your protocol\\nand what you've experienced.\\nPut it in the comment section if you would.\\nI'd appreciate that.\\nThere's another very important and potent use of caffeine\\nfor enhancing performance.\\nAnd this relates not just to the dopamine\\nand epinephrine and the arousal inducing effects of caffeine.\\nAnd it doesn't even just relate to the effect of caffeine\\non enhancing frontal lobe function.\\nIt does include all that,\\nbut it also includes those reinforcing effects of caffeine\\nthat we talked about at the beginning of the episode.\\nAnd the best way to illustrate these performance enhancing\\neffects of caffeine that stem directly\\nfrom its association with reinforcement\\nis to highlight a study.\\nAnd the title of the study is blood dopamine level\\nenhanced by caffeine in men after treadmill running.\\nAnd as the title suggests, this was carried out in men,\\nbut there's no reason to think that the same results\\nwouldn't also be present in women.\\nThere are some sex dependent effects of caffeine\\nI'll touch on just briefly at the end,\\nbut those are largely present in kids,\\nthat is adolescents and teens as opposed to adults.\\nSo this study is really interesting.\\nWhat they had people do was run on a treadmill\\nand either ingest caffeine again,\\nthree milligrams per kilogram of body weight\\nor to not ingest caffeine.\\nAnd then they looked at levels of dopamine\\nand other neurotransmitters and hormones\\nsuch as prolactin and cortisol.\\nAnd the basic takeaway is as the title suggests\\nthat exercise while on its own can increase cortisol\\nin healthy ways, provided it's not too intense and too long.\\nLittle note here, if you have trouble recovering\\nfrom exercise or you want to continue to derive\\nthe benefits from exercise in general,\\nbest not to do high intensity exercise\\nfor longer than 75 minutes or 90 minutes\\nonly being the outer threshold.\\nI realize that there are some genetic freaks out there\\nor people that are chemically assisted that can recover\\nfrom very intense long bouts of exercise,\\nbut most people don't do well long bouts of intense exercise\\non a regular basis and limiting their intense exercise\\nto 60 minutes or less.\\nThat doesn't include the warmup is going to be beneficial.\\nSee the episode on a toolkit for fitness\\nif you'd like details on that.\\nExercise is known to increase levels of dopamine,\\ncortisol and other catecholamines\\nand neurotransmitters very potently\\nand things like testosterone and estrogen\\nin ways that we know are beneficial to us.\\nAnd of course have all these positive effects\\non the musculoskeletal system and cardiovascular effects.\\nBut unbeknownst to most people ingesting\\nthree milligrams per kilogram of caffeine prior to exercise\\nfurther increases the dopamine release associated\\nwith exercise specifically.\\nAnd this has two important effects.\\nFirst of all, that increase in dopamine is great\\nbecause it provides a long lasting increase\\nin focus alertness and motivation,\\nnot just during the exercise, but also after the exercise.\\nAnd second, it that is caffeine and dopamine in combination\\nact as a reinforcer to make the experience of exercise\\nand the period immediate after exercise more pleasant\\nand in fact reinforcing.\\nSo in other words, one way to enjoy exercise more\\nand to enjoy the activities that follow exercise more\\nand to experience a genuine increase in dopamine\\nthat's beneficial for mood and alertness\\nis to ingest caffeine prior to exercise.\\nNow, this is important because a number of people out there\\nare exercising, love exercise, love eating great,\\nlove doing all the things that are beneficial\\nfor their health.\\nBut a number of people out there\\nreally don't like to exercise.\\nAnd that serves as a serious block for their willingness\\nand their consistency to exercise.\\nIngesting caffeine gives us energy to exercise.\\nIt increases the release of neurochemicals and hormones\\nthat are good for us during exercise.\\nBut as I'm highlighting here,\\nit also increases the reinforcement pathways\\nassociated with exercise.\\nThat is it creates a positive feeling\\nabout the general theme of engaging in exercise\\nand it creates a general positive experience\\nof the things that follow exercise.\\nSo I think this, if nothing else is a call for\\nor support for the idea that ingesting caffeine\\nas a performance enhancing tool makes perfect sense.\\nBut for those out there that don't enjoy exercise\\nin particular, certain forms of exercise,\\ningesting caffeine can change your relationship\\nto that exercise.\\nIn other words, make it more positive\\nmuch in the same way that ingesting caffeine\\nalongside a certain taste that would otherwise be neutral\\nor maybe even negative can actually make the taste\\nof that particular drink or food positive.\\nSo again, this brings us back\\nto the reinforcing properties of caffeine\\nthat are subconscious.\\nIt's not just about the enhanced performance in the test\\nor the enhanced performance on the treadmill\\nor with the weights in the gym.\\nIt's enhanced feelings of mood and wellbeing\\nthat are genuine because of the effect of caffeine\\non certain neurotransmitter and hormone systems.\\nBut it also is creating an overall milieu\\nof reinforcing all of the things that led into,\\noccur during and occur after exercise.\\nI do want to point out something that's very important\\nas it relates to combining things like caffeine\\nand exercise in order to increase dopamine.\\nThis is something that came up in the episode that I did\\non dopamine motivation and drive,\\nwhich turns out to be one of our most popular episodes.\\nAgain, you can find that at hubermanlab.com\\nand links to all formats with timestamps, et cetera.\\nThis also came up in the episode on ADHD\\nbecause of the relationship between ADHD and dopamine.\\nAnd that's this notion of dopamine stacking.\\nIn the episode on dopamine motivation and drive,\\nI pointed out that while there are a near infinite number\\nof things that can increase dopamine release,\\nmost notably positive surprise or positive anticipation\\nor experiencing a win, certainly there are compounds,\\nboth drugs of abuse, food, sex and certain supplements\\nthat can increase dopamine to varying levels\\nand to varying degrees, both healthy and unhealthy.\\nThat's all contained in that episode\\non dopamine motivation and drive.\\nBut what I pointed out is that if you are somebody\\nwho tends to experience difficulty with motivation,\\nthat so-called dopamine stacking, as I called it,\\nmight be something that you want to avoid.\\nWhat is dopamine stacking?\\nDopamine stacking would be combining\\na highly caffeinated energy drink\\nthat also includes the amino acid tyrosine,\\nwhich is a precursor to dopamine, plus loud music,\\nplus getting yourself really ramped up\\nthan an intense workout.\\nAll of that can be great if you do it every once in a while,\\nbut what you will quickly find is that\\nthe extent to which your dopamine peaks\\nalso dictates the extent to which your dopamine\\nwill drop after that peak.\\nAnd when I say drop, I mean drop below baseline.\\nSo a lot of people find that they stack a lot of things\\nto peak their dopamine, then they experience a low\\nand it does take some time for them to return to baseline.\\nAnd I highly recommend not engaging in activities\\nor consuming compounds that are in attempt\\nto accelerate that return to baseline\\nbecause all it will do is drive that baseline lower and lower.\\nSo this requires being able to tolerate a drop\\nin dopamine baseline for a period of time, et cetera.\\nNow, the reason I'm bringing this up now\\nin the context of this caffeine episode\\nis I just described a study in which using caffeine\\nprior to exercise increases dopamine after exercise.\\nAnd so you might be saying,\\nespecially if you heard that earlier episode,\\nwait, isn't that dopamine stacking?\\nAren't you encouraging me to stack my dopamine?\\nWell, in some sense, yes, but keep in mind,\\nI'm not suggesting that you do this every time you exercise.\\nSo just as in that earlier episode,\\nI emphasized the fact that while stacking multiple stimuli,\\nright, caffeine or energy drinks and music and et cetera,\\nfor exercise or for mental work or for any experience\\nfor that matter is okay to do every once in a while\\nfor most people, you don't want to get in the habit\\nof doing it consistently every time you exercise\\nor every time you go out, for instance.\\nAnd so you really want to be cautious.\\nThat is you want to protect your both baseline levels\\nof dopamine and your peak levels of dopamine.\\nThat said, for people that want to experience an increase\\nin mood alertness and performance,\\nor who want to condition themselves\\nbecause that's really what it is.\\nIt's conditioning yourself\\nby the reinforcing effects of dopamine\\nto increase your liking,\\nor maybe even your loving of exercise,\\noccasionally using caffeine\\nor frequently using caffeine prior to exercise is fine,\\nbut be very careful.\\nAnd by being very careful, what I mean is pay attention\\nto how you feel in the hours and days\\nafter that dopamine increase wears off.\\nSo for instance, if you ingest caffeine\\nand then exercise very intensely\\nand you're feeling great afterwards,\\nbut then eight hours later or the next day,\\nyou're feeling a little bit low,\\nI suggest you don't go back\\nand do the exact same thing right away.\\nI would give yourself a little bit of time\\nto let that baseline of dopamine return to normal.\\nSo again, stacking different things,\\nchemical and behavioral in order to increase dopamine\\ncan be done in a safe way that's beneficial to you\\ndepending on your goals,\\nbut be careful about not stacking too many stimuli\\nfor dopamine too often.\\nThat's the key.\\nEarly in the episode,\\nI mentioned one possible caffeine consuming schedule\\nthat works very well,\\nthat doesn't fortunately subject you to long 20 day bouts\\nor five day or even two day bouts of abstinence.\\nAnd that's the every other day schedule of caffeine.\\nIf you look at the half life of caffeine\\nand you look at its effects on the dopamine system\\nand its performance enhancing effects\\nand how a period of abstinence can in fact,\\nincrease the performance enhancing effects of caffeine,\\nbut also take into consideration\\nthat caffeine can be habit forming\\nand we can develop a sort of tolerance to caffeine.\\nWell, then what emerges from all of that\\nis that being a person who consumes caffeine\\nevery other day can actually help you maximize\\nmost of the positive effects of caffeine\\nwithout subjecting you to the kind of misery that occurs\\nif you're accustomed to consuming caffeine every single day\\nand then suddenly go into a two or five\\nor 20 day abstinence.\\nSo I myself have never tried\\nan every other day caffeine approach.\\nAlthough I'm considering doing it based on the literature\\nthat I've read and I'm considering doing it\\nin a very specific way,\\nwhich would be to only consume caffeine on the days\\nin which I resistance train.\\nAnd since I tend to do that about three or four days\\nper week, organized in a way that's every other day.\\nAgain, if you want to see the exercise schedule\\nthat I follow, including cardiovascular exercise\\nand weight training and all the reasons and rationale\\nfor what I do and how it maps onto the scientific literature\\nrelated to health span and life span, vitality, et cetera,\\nyou can find that at hubermanlab.com\\nand we had a toolkit for fitness\\nthat ought to be posted to our website before long.\\nThe every other day schedule of caffeine intake to me\\nseems like the most rational one\\nif one wants to maximize on the performance enhancing effects\\nof caffeine without suffering the effects\\nof caffeine withdrawal that are associated\\nwith being a regular consumer of caffeine\\nand then stopping caffeine intake such as headache\\nand irritability and so forth.\\nNot I nor anyone in my life wants me\\nto experience those effects.\\nAnd I'm sure you don't want to experience\\nthose effects for you either.\\nSo if you're somebody that decides\\nto try the every other day protocol\\nor you are somebody who's already doing that protocol,\\nplease let me know what your experiences with that are.\\nAt least by my read of the literature on caffeine\\nand its performance enhancing effects,\\nbut also the effects of caffeine\\non neurotransmitter and hormone systems,\\nthe every other day caffeine schedule\\ndoes seem to be the most rational\\nand scientifically grounded one\\nin order to maximize on all those effects.\\nIn addition to so-called performance enhancing effects\\nof caffeine, there are also the well-studied\\nand now fairly well mechanistically understood\\npro-health effects of caffeine.\\nNow here, when I talk about pro-health effects of caffeine,\\nI want to be very clear that if your schedule\\nof caffeine intake, that is your timing of caffeine intake\\nor anything else for that matter,\\noffsets getting regular high quality sleep\\nof sufficient duration,\\nwell, then you are undermining\\nthe pro-health effects of that thing.\\nThis is true for exercise, this is true for caffeine,\\nthis is true for supplementation,\\nthis is true for prescription drugs.\\nAgain, you don't want to be neurotically attached\\nto the idea that you have to get perfect sleep every night\\nbecause that's simply not true,\\nbut is absolutely the case that anything,\\nwhether or not it's good for you or bad for you\\nin the short term that disrupts your sleep\\nbecause of the timing in which you're doing that thing\\nis going to undermine your immediate\\nand long-term health before long.\\nSo with that said, there are several well-described\\nhealth promoting effects of caffeine ingestion.\\nAnd once again, when I say caffeine ingestion,\\nI'm referring to that one to three milligrams\\nper kilogram of body weight dosage.\\nThere are really nice studies showing that\\nbeing a regular consumer of caffeine\\ncan help offset some of the probability,\\nsome of the probability of developing Parkinson's\\nand maybe Alzheimer's related dementia as well.\\nThese are not terribly controversial data\\nbecause of the fact that caffeine is known\\nto increase the release of those catecholamines,\\ndopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine\\nas well as acetylcholine.\\nAll those neurotransmitter and neuromodulator systems\\nare the ones that are known to be defective\\nin Parkinson's and Alzheimer's,\\nalthough there are other transmitter and hormone systems\\nthat are defective as well.\\nThere are beautiful reviews on the neuroprotective effects\\nof caffeine and neurodegenerative diseases.\\nThey're quite extensive.\\nAnd I'll just refer you to one\\nand the references therein.\\nAnd we'll provide a link to this in the show note captions.\\nSo the title, as the topic at hand suggests\\nis the neuroprotective effects of caffeine\\nand neurodegenerative diseases.\\nThis was published in 2016.\\nI'm sure there have been other reviews since then,\\nbut it includes many, many quality references\\nand studies both in animals and in humans\\npointing to the fact that specific enzymes\\nthat are associated with the health\\nof in particular dopamine neurons\\nare made more robust by regular ingestion of caffeine.\\nIt also points to the fact that the increase\\nin dopamine receptors that is induced\\nby regular ingestion of caffeine that I referred to earlier\\nis another way in which dopamine,\\nhowever many dopamine neurons remain around\\nin people with Parkinson's or people who are aging\\nthat lose dopamine neurons naturally,\\nthat dopamine can have its maximal effect\\nbecause of the increase in receptors for dopamine\\nthat caffeine induces.\\nAnd there are other biological mechanisms\\nthat further support why caffeine\\nought to be neuroprotective,\\nincluding its effects on the acetylcholine system,\\nwhich is one of the major systems disrupted\\nin Alzheimer's dementia.\\nSo in other words, it makes perfect sense\\nas to why caffeine would be neuroprotective.\\nCaffeine has also been shown to diminish headache,\\nparticularly when taken in combination with aspirin.\\nAnd that's because of the effects\\nof caffeine and aspirin on blood flow.\\nThere's also evidence that caffeine can provide brief\\nbut substantial relief from asthma.\\nSo I wouldn't want people to rely on caffeine\\nas a life-saving approach to an asthmatic attack.\\nThat said, for people that suffer from minor asthma,\\nthat caffeine intake, again, of the dosages\\nthat we talked about before has been shown\\nto alleviate some of the major symptoms of asthma\\nfor anywhere from one to four hours.\\nAnd I know this is of relevance\\nto a lot of people out there.\\nBecause caffeine increases the catecholamines\\nand in particular because caffeine increases dopamine\\ntransmission in the prefrontal cortex,\\nthis area of the brain associated with focus\\nand rule setting and context and task switching.\\nCaffeine is known to improve focus and alertness\\nin particular in people who have symptoms of ADHD\\nor other attention and focus issues.\\nNow, caffeine alone does not appear to be as potent\\nfor the treatment of ADHD as are things like Ritalin,\\nAdderall, Modafinil and Armodafinil and Vyvanse.\\nIf you would like a sort of head-by-head comparison\\nof prescription drugs, supplements,\\nand things like caffeine, as well as coverage\\nof behavioral tools and nutritional tools, et cetera,\\nthat can positively offset some of the symptoms of ADHD,\\nplease see the episode that I did on ADHD.\\nAgain, that's available at hubermanlab.com in all formats.\\nBut that said, caffeine does increase focus\\nand it does it through a number of different mechanisms,\\nnot the least of which is to increase dopamine transmission\\nin the forebrain, just as a drug like Ritalin or Adderall\\nwould, although not to the same extent\\nas a drug like Ritalin or Adderall does.\\nBefore we close today, I do want to just briefly return\\nto the reinforcing effects of caffeine\\nthat we talked about earlier.\\nThis study on the honeybees that showed that bees\\nprefer certain nectars because they contain caffeine,\\neven though they are not aware\\nthat those nectars contain caffeine.\\nThey just come to like the feeling\\nthat those nectars provide them so much\\nthat they associate that in a subconscious way\\nwith the flowers themselves,\\nand they come to like those flowers.\\nOr human beings, for instance,\\nchildren that ingest caffeinated beverages\\ncome to adore the taste of those beverages.\\nAnd beautiful studies have been done\\nthat describe how children and adults\\ntruly cannot distinguish between the taste\\nof a caffeinated and non-caffeinated beverage,\\nand caffeine can be placed into essentially any beverage\\nin order to give us a preference for that beverage or food.\\nIn fact, the studies have been done with yogurt.\\nIf you put caffeine into yogurt of different flavors,\\neven plain yogurt, which most kids don't like,\\nthey will come to prefer whatever flavor\\ncontain the caffeine,\\neven if then you remove the caffeine from that flavor.\\nNow, eventually their preference for that flavor\\nwill be extinguished,\\nbut all of this is just to say\\nthat so many of the things that we like,\\nwhether or not it's coffee or tea\\nor a given flavor of food or a given experience\\nor even exercise occur because we ingest caffeine\\nin conjunction with those activities.\\nNow, these are not tricks\\nthat your nervous system plays on you.\\nThese are real neurochemical reinforcing effects.\\nAnd I think that we would all do well to think about\\nand to leverage these reinforcing effects\\nmuch in the same way we would do well\\nto think about and hopefully not leverage\\naversive effects of certain compounds, right?\\nThe simple way to put this is I or anyone could get you\\nto dislike something, someone or someplace\\nby making you feel slightly less good, lower mood.\\nI don't even have to make you feel nauseous,\\nbut less good after ingesting something\\nor having a certain kind of interaction\\nor being in a certain environment.\\nVery straightforward to do that\\nbecause of the way that your nervous system\\nis wired for conditioning.\\nHowever, there's the positive side of all this,\\nwhich is that it's very straightforward\\nto reinforce the experience of a given food,\\nincluding its taste, but all the context around it,\\nthe container, the texture, the people you consume it with,\\nwhere you consume it, et cetera.\\nFor instance, I wonder why we are not pairing caffeine\\nwith broccoli and that here I'm not suggesting\\nthat people actually do that experiment\\nor play that trick on people,\\nbut you have to sort of imagine\\nthat if caffeine is this incredible reinforcer\\nof all sorts of things, in particular,\\nthings that we ingest and would want to ingest more of\\nif it's paired with caffeine,\\nwell, then you actually can use caffeine as a tool\\nto increase reinforcement of different things\\nand you can avoid caffeine as a way\\nto further reinforce things that you would like to stop.\\nAnd here I'd like to just give the example\\nof sugar cravings.\\nA lot of people ask me, how do I avoid sugar cravings?\\nI've talked about the use of L-glutamine for that.\\nI've talked about making sure\\nyou're getting enough essential fatty acids\\nand essential amino acids as a way to reduce sugar cravings.\\nPlease note, however, that if you are somebody\\nwho likes to have your sugar,\\nwhether or not it's a piece of chocolate\\nor your dessert, et cetera, I'm not saying that's bad,\\nbut if you're trying to reduce your sugar cravings,\\nask yourself, are you ingesting sugar along with caffeine?\\nCould be the caffeine contained in that sugar\\ncontaining food like chocolate,\\nor it could be that you're having a cup of coffee\\nalong with your pastry\\nand then you're struggling with sugar cravings.\\nWell, think about it.\\nYou're not just being reinforced by the sugar\\nand the effects of sugar on dopamine,\\nwhich are real and both conscious and subconscious\\nthrough the gut to the brain dopamine system\\nand direct on the brain dopamine system.\\nBut by co-ingesting caffeine,\\nyou are also further enhancing\\nthe reinforcing effects of sugar.\\nThe flip side to all of this is that you could use caffeine\\nas a way to increase your appetite for certain things.\\nI actually know somebody,\\nI won't reveal who this person is,\\nbut they are quite prominent podcaster\\nwho ingests 125 to 150 milligrams of caffeine\\nin tablet form, in tablet form,\\nalong with herbal tea and use this as a way\\nto develop a preference for herbal tea\\nbecause they found that coffee was giving them other effects\\nthat weren't good for them.\\nSo it works quite well in animals\\nand it works quite well in insects\\nand it works quite well in humans.\\nI suppose animals, insects and humans are all animals\\nat the end of the day.\\nSo no surprise there,\\nbut it all underscores the extent to which caffeine\\nis an absolutely fascinating molecule.\\nI mean, it's an ability to offset the sleepiness system,\\nif you will, this adenosine system\\nand to control our schedules in that way,\\nto essentially take a withdrawal against the bank\\nthat is adenosine and then pay that back later\\nin the form of getting sleepy later\\nas opposed to when we want to be alert.\\nIts ability to enhance focus, alertness and mood\\nand if taken after trying to learn something\\nand remember it to enhance memory, especially,\\nand its ability to increase VO2 max, increase strength.\\nWe didn't even talk today about it,\\nbut I'll just briefly mention that caffeine ingested\\nin the sorts of doses we talked about earlier\\nbecause its effects on the neuromuscular system\\nand the calcium system associated\\nwith neuromuscular exertion and fatigue\\ncan increase peak power output and muscle contractibility.\\nIt's enhancing performance there as well.\\nAnd of course, caffeine does a number of other things\\njust generally related to our overall\\nand basal level of mood and alertness,\\nnot the least of which are these increases in dopamine.\\nSo caffeine is really an incredible molecule.\\nIt's affecting all these various neurotransmitter systems,\\nbut not haphazardly.\\nIt's increasing dopamine and acetylcholine\\nin the forebrain to increase attention.\\nIt's reducing fatigue.\\nIt's improving mental and physical performance\\nfor some obvious and some not so obvious reasons\\nand what I think is among the more miraculous\\nand powerful effects of caffeine,\\nit is a potent, potent, potent reinforcer\\nof things, foods, people, and experiences.\\nAnd it's one that you can leverage\\nin any direction that you like\\nonce you understand the way that caffeine exerts\\nthose reinforcing properties.\\nSo today I've really tried to cover as much as I could\\nabout the mechanisms of caffeine action\\nin the brain and body,\\nas well as tools and schedules and dosages\\nin which you can leverage caffeine\\nin order to meet your physical performance,\\nmental performance, and frankly,\\nmental health and overall health goals.\\nIf you're learning from and are enjoying this podcast,\\nplease subscribe to our YouTube channel.\\nThat's a terrific, zero-cost way to support

       "[Document(page_content=\"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.\\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.\\nToday, we are discussing caffeine.\\nCaffeine is one of the most widely used substances on the planet.\\nEstimates are that more than 90% of adults and as many as 50% of kids, that is adolescents and teenagers, use caffeine on a daily basis.\\nCaffeine is an amazing molecule.\\nMost people are familiar with caffeine's ability to increase alertness and to reduce our feelings of sleepiness and fatigue.\\nAnd indeed, it does that.\\nBut what most people are not aware of is that caffeine acts as a strong reinforcer.\\nWhat I mean by reinforcer is that when caffeine is present in a drink or food, and yes, indeed, caffeine is present in many foods, even unbeknownst to us, when it's present in drinks and foods, we actively come to like those foods and drinks more than if caffeine were not contained in those foods and drinks.\\nSo it reinforces our liking of particular foods and drinks, and indeed, it even reinforces our liking of the containers they are consumed from and the company we keep when we consume foods and drinks that contain caffeine.\\nThat is, caffeine is not just a stimulant, caffeine is a reinforcer, and it's a reinforcer that plays an active role in almost everybody's daily life.\\nWe can say that with confidence because, as I mentioned a moment ago, more than 90% of people are consuming caffeine, and most people think that they consume caffeine because it makes them feel more alert.\\nBut there are many reasons why you're consuming caffeine, and I'm not going to tell you that consuming caffeine isn't necessarily bad.\\nIn fact, today, I'm going to tell you about many of the positive health benefits of caffeine, including neuroprotective effects, anti-depressive effects, and certainly performance-enhancing effects, both for mental performance and for physical performance.\", metadata={'source': '/home/damir/Projects/huberman_rag/docs/youtube/Using Caffeine to Optimize Mental & Physical Performance ï½œ Huberman Lab Podcast 101.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Now, that said, there are certain situations in which you want to avoid caffeine, and there are certain people who might opt to avoid caffeine.\\nThat's especially the case when one thinks about caffeine not just as a stimulant, but as a reinforcer.\\nIn fact, caffeine is such a strong reinforcer that if even tiny amounts of caffeine are present in certain foods and drinks, you will very quickly come to prefer those foods and drinks over other choices, which can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on what sorts of food and drink choices you're trying to make.\\nSo today, I'm going to inform you about how caffeine works at a mechanistic level.\\nI promise to do that with a minimum of nomenclature and such that even if you don't have a background in biology, you will be able to digest that information easily.\\nAnd then I'll tell you how to use caffeine to your advantage, or conversely, how to avoid caffeine at certain times to your advantage.\\nSo today's episode will focus both on mechanisms and tools that is the use and leverage of caffeine to improve mental health, physical health, and performance.\\nBefore we go any further into today's discussion, I want to tell you about some recent results about a molecule that's found in certain caffeinated beverages and that has been proven to be very useful for both weight loss, mental performance, and controlling blood sugar levels.\\nAnd that's GLP-1 or glucagon-like peptide-1.\\nGlucagon-like peptide-1 is found in the brain and body.\\nIt acts both on the brain and body.\\nIt does many different things, but one of its primary effects that's been discovered is to reduce hunger, and it does that two ways.\\nIt does that by activating certain neurons in your hypothalamus, so that's a brain region that controls hunger and satiety.\\nIt makes us feel full at the level of the brain, so it makes us feel sated, that is, and it actually makes us feel full.\", metadata={'source': '/home/damir/Projects/huberman_rag/docs/youtube/Using Caffeine to Optimize Mental & Physical Performance ï½œ Huberman Lab Podcast 101.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Turns out that GLP-1 acts on certain receptors in the gut to make us feel as if we've ingested enough food.\\nIt doesn't necessarily make us feel as if our gut is distended, but it makes us feel full.\\nThat's really interesting, because if you think about it, when we eat, our stomach fills up, obviously, and that information has to be communicated to the brain such that the brain can then send satiety signals that actually shut off our hunger.\\nAnd believe it or not, the brain actually activates signals to reduce the desire to chew when our stomach is full.\\nAnd GLP-1, as I mentioned, works on the brain to create these feelings of satiety, as if we've had enough, and to reduce our desire to eat more.\\nAnd GLP-1 acts directly on the gut to give us a slight sense of fullness in the gut, which then is communicated to the brain.\\nSo really, there are two parallel signals being sent when we have GLP-1 present in our system.\\nNow, a little bit of relevant history on GLP-1, it was actually discovered in Gila monsters.\\nThese are these reptiles that can go long periods of time without eating, and a very clever scientist decided to study why it is that certain animals, like Gila monsters, can go a long period of time without ingesting anything, and it's because they produce very large amounts of GLP-1.\\nThey isolate the peptide from GLP-1, then they looked for the analogous peptide in humans, and it turns out that does exist.\\nAnd as I mentioned, it's released in both brain and body to make you feel full and sated.\\nWhy am I telling you all this? Well, today we're going to talk about caffeine, and there's one particular caffeine source, which is yerba mate, and there's some other forms of teas, similar to yerba mate, that stimulate the release of GLP-1 significantly.\", metadata={'source': '/home/damir/Projects/huberman_rag/docs/youtube/Using Caffeine to Optimize Mental & Physical Performance ï½œ Huberman Lab Podcast 101.txt'}),\n",

Aren't you encouraging me to stack my dopamine?
