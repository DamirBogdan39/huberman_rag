       "[Document(page_content=\"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [upbeat music] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a Professor of\\nNeurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we are going to discuss\\nthe science and practice of flexibility and stretching. Flexibility and stretching\\nare topics that I believe do not receive nearly as much\\nattention as they deserve. For most people, the topics\\nof flexibility and stretching bring to mind things like yoga, injury prevention, or\\nmaybe even contortionism. But it turns out that\\nflexibility and stretching are features that are built\\ninto our basic body plan. Young children, young animals, and adults, and, indeed, older children and animals all stretch and all have\\nsome degree of flexibility. It turns out that having flexibility, and our ability to stretch, and the interaction between\\nstretching and flexibility are fundamental to how we move, our ability to learn new movements, indeed also to prevent\\ninjury or repair injuries, and to offsetting and\\nreducing inflammation throughout the body. In fact, today I'm going to share with you a remarkable set of studies\\nthat show that stretching can actually adjust\\nthings like tumor growth. This is work that was done\\nby one of the major directors of the National Institutes of Health. So, today's discussion will start with a description of the mechanisms, literally the cells and the connections\\nfrom your nervous system that mediate flexibility and stretching. And I promise that I'll make that information accessible to you whether or not you have a\\nbiology background or not. Then with that information in hand, I'm going to present to you\\nwhat the scientific literature says about the best times\\nand ways to stretch, everything right down to the detail of how long to hold a stretch, whether or not to hold a stretch at all because it turns out there are\\nmultiple kinds of stretching\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". So, you can imagine you have stretches where you hold the stretch\\nfor a very long time and use as little momentum as possible, and then there's also\\nwhat's called dynamic and ballistic stretching where you're literally swinging your limbs trying to increase the range of motion. I will explain the science and application of flexibility and stretching in the context of sports performance, whether or not you are engaging\\nin cardiovascular exercise, or resistance exercise, or both, whether or not you're\\na competitive athlete or simply a recreational\\nexerciser, as I am, whether or not you are\\ntrying to increase your range of motion and flexibility\\nfor longevity purposes, or whether or not you're trying to do it in order to access different\\nparts of your nervous system 'cause we'll soon learn today that your ability to improve flexibility and, indeed, to engage in\\nspecific stretching exercises can actually be used\\nto powerfully modulate your ability to tolerate pain, both emotional and physical pain. So, this thing that we call\\nflexibility and stretching is actually a vast landscape. We're going to simplify and\\norganize all that for you today and by the end of today's episode, you're going to have a number\\nof simple, easy-to-apply tools that are grounded in the\\nbest scientific research that you can apply for\\nyour specific goals. Before we begin, I'd like to\\nemphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching\\nand research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part\\nof my desire and effort to bring zero-cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the\\nsponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Thesis. Thesis makes custom nootropics that are designed to\\nget your brain and body into the optimal state for the\\ncognitive and physical things that you need to perform\\nat the highest level\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". I have to confess, in fact\\nI've said it many times before, I am not a fan of the word nootropics because it means smart drugs. And frankly, as a neuroscientist, I'd be remiss If I didn't acknowledge that there's really no\\ncircuit in your brain for being smart, you have neural circuits in\\nyour brain that are designed to get you to focus very well,\\nor to task switch very well, or to be creative. Thesis understands this, and as a consequence\\nthey've designed nootropics that are tailored to your specific needs in the cognitive and physical realm. What I mean by that is if\\nyou go to the Thesis site, you fill out a short quiz, and they'll give you the opportunity to try a small kit of different nootropics with different ingredients. You have the opportunity to\\ntry several different blends over the course of the month and discover which nootropics works best for your unique brain\\nchemistry and genetics. I've been using Thesis for about eight and a half months now, and I can confidently\\nsay that their nootropics have been a game changer. To get your own personalized\\nnootropic starter kit, you can go online to\\ntakethesis.com/huberman.

InsideTracker is a\\npersonalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in\\ngetting regular bloodwork done for the simple reason\\nthat many of the factors that impact your immediate\\nand long-term health can only be analyzed from\\na quality blood test. One issue with a lot of blood\\ntests and DNA tests out there is that you get information\\nback about hormone levels, metabolic factors, et cetera, but you don't know what to\\ndo with that information\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",

Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers that have cooling, heating,\\nand sleep tracking capacity. And, indeed, you can dial in, you can literally program the temperature of your\\nsleeping environment from the time you go to sleep until the time you wake up in the morning. This turns out to be immensely powerful because as I've talked\\nabout on the podcast before, in order to fall asleep\\nand stay deeply asleep throughout the night, your body has to drop by\\nabout one to three degrees, and waking up in the morning actually involves a warming\\nup of your body temperature. For many people, they just\\ncan't precisely control their sleep environment well enough in order for all that to go well. I was one such person. So, for a long time I'd\\nfall asleep pretty easily, but then I'd wake up in\\nthe middle of the night, I tended to run warm, but then sometimes I'd feel\\nreally tired in the morning as if I couldn't wake up.

I programmed it so that the temperature would be rather cool in the\\nearly part of the evening when I would get into bed and then would drop into the\\ndeeper phases of the night when I was entering deep sleep and then rapid eye movement sleep, and then would warm towards morning, it would help me wake up quickly.

Before we talk about the practices of flexibility and stretching, I'd like to just highlight\\nsome of the features that are already built\\ninto your nervous system and into your body that\\nallow you to be flexible. Some of us feel tighter than others, sometimes in specific\\nlimbs or areas of our body, some people feel really loose and limb, some people even have what's\\ncalled a hyper-flexibility. I, for instance, have a relative\\nthat can take her fingers and bend them back to the point\\nwhere they touch her wrist. And it always makes me\\ncringe a little bit, but she can do that without any pain, she seems to have some\\nhyper-flexibility in her joints. I do not have that feature. Some of you may find that\\nyou are more flexible than others naturally, and some of you might be thinking you don't need to build\\nin additional flexibility\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". Well, I think by the\\nend of today's episode, you'll realize that almost\\nall of us can benefit from having some sort of\\nunderstanding about flexibility and having some stretching protocol that we incorporate into our life, if not just for physical\\nperformance reasons and for postural reasons, then also for cognitive\\nand mental reasons, and I'll be sure to clarify\\nwhat all of that means. Right now, I'd like to take a moment and just highlight the\\nflexibility that you already have. For instance, if you were to move your arm behind your torso a little bit and then sort of let go or stop exerting any effort in doing that, you would find that the limb would return more or less to a position\\nnext to your torso, at least I would hope so. And why is that? Well, it turns out that there are aspects of your nervous system, aspects\\nof your skeletal system, aspects of your muscles, and aspects of the connective tissue that binds all of that together, that try and restore a particular order or position to your limbs and your limbs relative to one another. So, that reflects a very\\nspecific set of processes that it turns out are\\nthe same set of processes that you use when you are trying to enhance flexibility and stretching. So, I'd like to just take a moment and review the basic\\nelements of nervous system, muscle, connective tissue,\\nand skeletal tissue, bone, that allow for flexibility and stretching. And here we can point\\nto two major mechanisms by which your nervous system, neurons, meaning nerve cells, communicate with muscles, and those muscles communicate\\nback to your nervous system to make sure that your\\nlimbs don't stretch too far, they don't move too far\\nsuch that you get injured. And in addition to that, mechanisms that ensure that\\nyou don't overload your muscles too much with weight, or\\nwith tension, or with effort and damage them that way\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". 'Cause it turns out that the\\nsecond security mechanism of making sure that you\\ndon't overload muscles can be leveraged toward increasing your flexibility\\nalmost immediately. That's right, there\\nare protocols and tools that I'll share with you\\nthat are going to allow you to vastly improve your\\nflexibility over time. But there are also\\nmechanisms that allow you to quite significantly increase\\nyour degree of flexibility in a very short period of time, and within just a few seconds. So, let's establish some of the\\nbasic biological mechanisms. Any time we talk about\\nbiology or physiology, we're going to talk about structure, meaning the cells and their connections, and functions, what they do. There are just a few names to understand, you do not have to memorize these names. The important thing that\\nI'd like you to know is that flexibility and\\nthe process of stretching and getting more flexible\\ninvolves three major components, neural, meaning of the nervous system, muscular, muscles, and connective tissue. Connective tissue is the stuff that surrounds the neural\\nstuff and the muscular stuff, although it's all kind of weaved together and braided together in complicated ways. Some of you may have heard of fascia. We're going to talk a little\\nbit about fascia today, although it's such an interesting tissue that's really deserving\\nof its own episode. Fascial tissue, we're going to\\ntalk about some of the stuff that surrounds muscles that\\nreally gives you your shape, and holds everything together, and allows for flexibility to occur. So, here's a key thing\\nthat everyone should know whether or not you're talking\\nabout flexibility or not. Your nervous system controls your muscles, it's what gets your muscles to contract. So, within your spinal cord, you have a category of\\nneurons, nerve cells, that are called motor neurons. To be precise, they\\nare lower motor neurons 'cause they're in your spinal cord\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". To be precise, they\\nare lower motor neurons 'cause they're in your spinal cord. We call them lower to distinguish them from the motor neurons\\nthat are in your brain up in your skull. Those lower motor neurons, hereafter I'll just refer\\nto them as motor neurons. If I want to talk about the\\nother kind of motor neurons, I'll say upper motor neurons. So, if I say motor neurons, I just mean the ones in your spinal cord. Those motor neurons send a little wire or set of wires out to your muscles, and that creates what's called\\na neuromuscular junction, which just means that the\\nneurons meet the muscles at a particular place. Those neurons release a chemical, that chemical is called acetylcholine. Some of you may have heard\\nabout acetylcholine before, acetylcholine also exists in your brain and does other things in your brain, mainly it's involved\\nin focus and attention. But at the neuromuscular junction, the release of acetylcholine\\nfrom these nerve cells, these neurons, onto the muscles causes the muscles to contract. And when muscles contract, they are able to move limbs by way of changing the\\nlength of the muscle, adjusting the function\\nof connective tissue like tendons and ligaments. And for instance, if you're bringing your wrist\\ncloser to your shoulder, that biceps muscle is\\ncontracting, it's getting shorter. I mean, in reality it hasn't\\ngotten shorter overall, it's just temporarily shorter, of course. All of that is controlled by neurons. And it's those motor\\nneurons from the spinal cord that are really responsible\\nfor the major movement of your limbs by way\\nof causing contraction of specific muscles at specific times. So, the key thing to\\ntake away is that nerve controls the contraction of muscles. Now, within the muscles themselves, there are nerve connections. And these are nerve connections that arise from a different set of\\nneurons in the spinal cord that we call sensory neurons\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". The sensory neurons exist in a different\\npart of the spinal cord, and they send a low wire or\\nset of wires into the muscles. And there's a particular\\nkind of sensory neuron that comes out of your spinal\\ncord and into your muscles, which are called spindle neurons. They create or they actually\\nwrap around muscle fibers, kind of corkscrew around them and give kind of a spring-like appearance. And for you aficionados out there, these are intrafusal\\nconnections or neurons. Intrafusal means within the muscle, but you really don't need to know that unless you're really curious about it, or you're going to\\nbecome a neuroscientist, or you're in medical school or something. These spindle connections\\nwithin the muscle that wrap around the muscle fibers sense the stretch of those muscle fibers. So, now we have two parts to\\nthe system that I've described. You've got motor neurons that can cause muscles\\nto contract and shorten, and we have these spindles\\nwithin the muscles themselves that wrap around the muscle fibers, and that information\\nis sent from the muscle back to the spinal cord. It's a form of sensing what's\\ngoing on in the muscle. Much in the same way that\\nyou have neurons in your eye that sense light in your\\nexternal environment, you have neurons in your\\near that sense sound waves in your external environment, you have neurons in your spinal cord that are sensory neurons that are sensing the amount\\nof stretch in the muscles. What happens is if a given\\nmuscle is stretching really far, those sensory neurons, those\\nspindles within the muscle will activate and will send\\na electrical potential, literally a bit of electricity along that wire's length\\ninto the spinal cord. And then, within the spinal cord that sensory neuron communicates through a series of intermediate steps, but to the motor neuron and makes sure that that\\nmotor neuron contracts\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". Now, why would that be useful? Well, what this does is\\nit creates a situation where if a muscle is or\\nis stretching too much because the range of motion of\\na limb is increased too much then the muscle will contract to bring that limb range of\\nmotion into a safe range again. Now, what determines whether\\nor not a range of motion is quote-unquote safe or not is dictated by a number of things. It's dictated by things that are happening in this kind of loop of neural connections in the spinal cord and muscle. It's also determined by\\nwhat's going on in your head, literally in your mind cognitively about whether or not the\\nmovement of that limb its increasing range of\\nmotion is good for you, whether or not you're\\ndoing it deliberately, whether or not it's bad for you. And then there are also\\nsome basic safety mechanisms that are put in there that\\nreally try and restrict our limb range of motion. Okay, so just to clarify, this whole thing looks like a loop, and the essential components of the loop are motor neurons contract muscles, sensory neurons, of\\nwhich there are a bunch of different varieties, well, in this case, what\\nwe're calling the spindles are sensing stretch within the muscles. And if a given muscle is elongating because of the increased\\nrange of motion of a limb, those sensory neurons\\nsend an electrical signal into the spinal cord such that there is an\\nactivation of the motor neuron, which by now should make perfect sense as to why that's useful. It then shortens up the muscle. It actually doesn't\\nreally shorten the muscle, but it contracts the muscle that brings the limb back\\ninto a safe range of motion. Okay, so this process is very fast, it was designed to keep\\nyour body together and safe. It's designed to make sure\\nthat you don't take your arm and swing it behind your torso and it just goes all the way back to the middle of your back\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". I mean, unless you're a contortionist or you've trained that kind\\nof level of flexibility, that would be terrible because it could provide a\\nlot of damage to the muscles, and to the connective\\ntissue, and so forth. So, that's one basic mechanism\\nthat we want to hold in mind, this idea of a spindle that senses stretch and can activate\\ncontraction of the muscles and shorten the muscles. The next mechanism I want to describe, and once again there are only two that you need to hold in\\nmind for this episode. This other mechanism has\\na lot of the same features as the one I just described, but it has less to do with stretch, in fact, it doesn't\\nhave to do with stretch as much as it has to\\ndo with sensing loads. So, at the end of each muscles\\nyou have tendons typically, and there are neurons that\\nare closely associated with those tendons that are called Golgi\\ntendon organs, right? These are neurons that are sensory neurons that sense how much load\\nis on a given muscle. Right, so if you're lifting\\nup something very, very heavy, these neurons are going to fire, meaning they're going to\\nsend electrical activity into the spinal cord. And then, those neurons have\\nthe ability to shut down, not activate, but shut down motor neurons and to prevent the\\ncontraction of a given muscle. So, for instance, if you were to walk over and try and pick up a weight\\nthat is much too heavy for you, meaning you could not do it\\nwithout injuring yourself and you start to try and heave\\nthat weight off the ground. There are a number of reasons why you might not be able to lift it, but let's say you start to get it a little bit off the ground, or you start to get some force generated that would allow it to move. But the force that you're generating could potentially rip your\\nmuscles or your tendons off of the bone, right, that it could disrupt the joints and it could tear ligaments\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='. Well, you have a safety\\nmechanism in place, it\\'s these Golgi tendon organs, these GTOs, as they\\'re called, they get activated and\\nshut down the motor neurons and make it impossible for\\nthose muscles to contract. Okay, so on the one hand, we have a mechanism that senses stretch and can figure out when\\nstretch is excessive. And when this system detects\\nthat stretch is excessive, it activates the contraction of muscles. And then, we have a second\\nmechanism that senses loads, and when tension or\\nloads is deemed excessive by these circuits, and remember these\\ncircuits don\\'t have a mind, they don\\'t go, \"Oh, this is excessive,\" they just sense loads. And when those loads\\nexceed a certain threshold, well then those GTOs,\\nthose Golgi tendon organs, send signals into the spinal cord that shut down your motor neuron\\'s ability to contract muscle so that\\nyou no longer can lift that heavy load. So, both of these are\\nprotective mechanisms, but both of these can be\\nleveraged in a very logical way and in a very safe way in order to increase your\\nlimb range of motion. So, there are a couple of\\nthings I want to point out before going a little bit further into how your nervous system controls flexibility and stretching, and those key points are the following. There are now dozens if\\nnot hundreds of studies that show that a dedicated\\nstretching practice can improve limb range of motion. Now, for many of you listening, you\\'re probably saying, \"Duh,\" but I think it\\'s important\\nto point that out, that a dedicated stretching practice can increase limb range of motion. And as you\\'ll soon learn, there are specific mechanisms\\nthat can explain that effect. The second point is one of longevity. And when I say longevity, I don\\'t necessarily mean late-stage aging. We all undergo a decrease\\nin limb range of motion, unless we do something\\nto offset that decrease', metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". We all undergo a decrease\\nin limb range of motion, unless we do something\\nto offset that decrease. And the current numbers\\nvary from study to study, but if you look en masse, you look at all of those studies and what you basically find is that we start to experience\\na decrease in flexibility from about age 20 until about\\nage 49 that's pretty dramatic. And then, of course, it\\nwill continue after age 49, but basically it's a 10%\\ndecrease every 10 years. So, we could say it's\\na 1% decrease per year, although it's not necessarily linear. What do I mean by that? Well, it's not necessarily\\nthat on your 21st birthday, you are 1% less flexible than you were on your 20th birthday and it decreased by 1% per year, some of these changes can be non-linear. So, you can imagine the person who's doing just fine\\nin terms of flexibility between 20 and 30, and then they get to 32 and suddenly they've lost\\n5% of their flexibility. Now, of course, there will be\\na ton of lifestyle factors. If you're a regular practitioner of yoga, if you have a dedicated\\nstretching practice, if you're doing other things to improve your muscle contractibility, so you're doing resistance training it turns out can actually\\nindirectly improve flexibility. There are a number of different factors, but the key point is that maintaining some degree of flexibility and maybe even enhancing range\\nof motion and flexibility is of immense benefit\\nfor offsetting injury provided it's not pushed too far. There are a number of people who have pushed their limb range of motion so far that they experience\\nall sorts of injuries, both acute and chronic injuries. Today, we'll also talk about\\nhow to avoid those scenarios\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='. Today, we\\'ll also talk about\\nhow to avoid those scenarios. Okay, so we\\'ve established\\nthat there are mechanisms within the spinal cord,\\nmuscles, and connective tissue, those remember it\\'s the motor neurons, the spindles, the GTOs, and, of course, the muscles themselves, and connective tissue, tendons, but also other forms of connective tissue that establish whether or not a limb is going to stay within a\\nparticular range of motion or not, and whether or not a limb\\nis going to be allowed by the nervous system to pursue or handle a given load, a given tension. There are also mechanisms that arrive to the neuromuscular system from higher up in the nervous\\nsystem, from the brain. And those mechanisms involve\\na couple of different facets that are really interesting, and I think that we should all know about. In fact, today, I\\'m going to\\nteach you about a set of neurons that I\\'m guessing 99.9% of\\nyou have never heard of, including all you\\nneuroscientists out there, if you\\'re out there, and\\nI know you\\'re out there, that seem uniquely enriched in humans and probably perform essential roles in our ability to regulate our physiology and our emotional state. So, within the brain, we have the ability to sense\\nthings in the external world, something we called exteroception, and we have the ability to sense things in our internal world within\\nour body, called interoception. Interoception can be the\\nvolume of food in your gut, whether or not you\\'re experiencing any organ pain or discomfort, whether or not you feel good\\nin your gut and in your organs, that\\'s actually a kind of\\nfeeling, \"Hmm, I feel great, I feel sated, I feel relaxed,\" but those are all different\\nforms of interoception. The main brain area that\\'s associated with interpreting what\\'s\\ngoing on in our body is called the insula, I-N-S-U-L-A. It\\'s a very interesting brain region, it\\'s got two major parts', metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='. It\\'s a very interesting brain region, it\\'s got two major parts. The front of it is mainly\\nconcerned with things like smell, and to some extent vision, and\\nto some extent other things that are arriving from the external world and combining with what\\'s\\ngoing on internally and making sense of all that, or at least routing that\\ninformation elsewhere in your nervous system to make decision, like if you smell something\\ngood to approach it, or if you smell something bad to avoid it. The front of the insula is really doing all of that kind of stuff\\nalong with other brain areas. The posterior insula, the\\nback of the insula that is, has a very interesting and\\ndistinct set of functions. The posterior insula is mainly concerned with what\\'s going on with\\nyour somatic experience. How do you feel internally? And how is the movement\\nthat you happen to be doing combining with your internal state to allow you to feel, as I like to say the nervous\\nsystem mainly batches things into yum, like, \"Oh, this\\nis really good for me,\" yuck, \"This is really bad\\nfor me and I need to stop,\" or meh, \"This is kind of neutral.\" Okay, so this isn\\'t about food, but we could say for most stimuli, most senses, whether or not they\\'re senses of things internally or externally, our nervous system is\\ntrying to make decisions about what to do with that information, and so it mainly batches\\ninformation into yum, I want to keep doing this\\nor approach this thing, or continue down some path\\nof movement, or eating, or staying in a temperature\\nenvironment, et cetera, or yuck, I need to get out of here, I don\\'t want any more of this, I don\\'t want to keep doing this, this is painful, or\\naversive, or stressful. And then meh, so if it\\ndoesn\\'t really matter, I can just kind of stay right here or not. Yum, yuck, and meh. Well, in your posterior insula, you have a very interesting population of very large neurons, these are exceptionally large neurons called von Economo neurons', metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". These are neurons that are, again, unbeknownst to most neuroscientists and they seem uniquely enriched in humans. Chimpanzees have them and some other large animals have them. So, they're found in whales, chimpanzees, elephants, and in humans. But even though we are much\\nsmaller than most whales and even though we are much\\nsmaller than most elephants, I mean, remember there are baby elephants. As far as I know, they haven't bred up like mini-elephants yet, they seem to have a teacup version of pretty much every dog breed. You can look that up, I certainly have mixed\\nfeelings about this notion of trying to downsize everything to the point where you could kind of like the pocket-sized bulldog I think of someday will arrive. I'm not a fan of that kind of downsizing of different breeds, but because there aren't teacup elephants and teacup gorillas, and teacup\\nchimpanzees, and so forth, most all of those other\\nspecies are larger than us. They have these von Economo neurons and we have these von Economo neurons, but we have in upwards\\nof 80,000 of these things in our posterior insula. These other species tend to have somewhere in the range of\\n1,000 to maybe 10,000 or so. Why is that interesting? Well, these von Economo neurons have the unique property of integrating our knowledge about our body movements, our sense of pain and discomfort, and can drive motivational processes that allow us to lean into discomfort and, indeed, to overcome any discomfort if we decide that the discomfort\\nthat we are experiencing is good for us or directed\\ntoward a specific goal. This knowledge turns out to be very important to keep in mind because as we migrate this conversation toward the things that we can do to enhance flexibility and stretching, you'll soon learn that there are moments within a stretching protocol where you have the opportunity\\nto either override pain and discomfort to kind of relax through it or push through it\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",

I\\'m going to allow these natural reflexes of the spindle to kick in and just essentially\\nstop me from stretching if a given limb isn\\'t designed or shouldn\\'t be stretched that far.\" So, I\\'d like you to keep these\\nvon Economo neurons in mind. I should mention they\\'re named von Economo because the guy, Constantin von Economo, that discovered them at the\\nend of the 1800s, early 1900s, decided to name them after\\nhimself, as many scientists do, or certainly the\\nneurologists and physicians are famous for naming\\nthings after themselves. These von Economo neurons turn out to be very\\nimportant to keep in mind as we embark on our exploration of what sorts of stretching practices can be best applied to\\nincrease flexibility because whether or not\\nyou undertake a mild, moderate, or intense flexibility training, you will no doubt encounter\\na scenario at some point where you will have to ask\\nyourself, \"Do I quote-unquote relax into this stretch, or do I try and push through just a little bit of discomfort?\" And I\\'ll explain how\\nto gauge that decision in a very specific and ideally safe way, and I\\'ll give you some\\ntools that will allow you to make that decision in a way that best preserves the integrity\\nof those neural circuits that I described earlier\\nand can keep you safe. These von Economo neurons\\nsit in the exact position that one would want to be able to evaluate what\\'s going on in the body, in particular what\\'s going on\\nin terms of limb movements, how that relates to our\\nfeelings of discomfort. And then there\\'s the other aspect of these von Economo neurons, which is that these von Economo neurons are connected to a number\\nof different brain areas that can shift our internal state from one of so-called\\nsympathetic activation', metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". So, this is a pattern of\\nalertness and even stress, sometimes even panic, but typically alertness and stress to one of so called\\nparasympathetic activation to one of relaxation. Oftentimes, you'll hear that stretching should be done by\\nrelaxing into the stretch. Well, what does it actually\\nmean to relax into the stretch? Well, these von Economo neurons sit at this junction where\\nthey're able to evaluate what's going on inside our body and allow us to access neural circuitries by which we can shift our\\nrelative level of alertness down a bit, or our relative\\nlevel of stress down a bit and thereby to increase so-called\\nparasympathetic activation and to literally override some\\nof those spindle mechanisms, even the GTO mechanisms, but especially the spindle mechanisms at the neuromuscular and\\nmuscular spinal junction. And in that way, gently, subtly override the reflex that would otherwise cause us to contract those muscles back. The reason that's possible\\nis because your brain has those other kinds of motor neurons, the upper motor neurons\\nthat can both direct, meaning control, and can\\noverride lower motor neurons. I'll give you a brief example of this that you've already done in your life, and that we all have the capacity for. What I'm referring to is the\\nmonosynaptic stretch reflex. This is something that every\\nfirst year neuroscience graduate student learns, which is that if you were to step on a sharp object with a bare foot, you would not need to make the decision to retract your foot, you\\nwould automatically do that provided you have a\\nhealthy nervous system. There are mechanisms in place that cause the retraction of that limb by way of ensuring that\\nthe proper muscles contract and other muscles do not contract, in fact, that they fully relax. Okay, so in the case of\\nstepping on a sharp object like a piece of glass,\\nor a nail, or a tack, you would essentially\\nactivate the hip flexor to lift up your foot\\nas quickly as possible\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='. In doing so, that same neural circuit would activate a contralateral, meaning opposite side of the body circuit, to ensure that the leg, the foot that\\'s not\\nstepping on the sharp object would do exactly the\\nopposite and would extend to make sure that you don\\'t fall over. All of that happens reflexively, it does not require any\\nthought or decision making. In fact, humans without any neocortex, literally that who decerebrate or an animal that doesn\\'t have... When I say decerebrate, I\\nmean lack of cerebral cortex. They can perform that because it\\'s all controlled by circuits that are basically below the\\nbrain and in the spinal cord. There\\'s a little bit of\\nactivation of circuits in the kind of deeper parts of the brain, but basically you don\\'t need to think or decide in order to do that. However, if your life depended on walking across some\\nsharp objects, let\\'s say. Let\\'s make it a little less dramatic so it\\'s not like the \"Die\\nHard\" movie or something where he has to run\\nbarefoot across the glass, although that\\'s a pretty good example of what I\\'m describing here, but let\\'s say you had to walk\\nacross some very hot stones to get away from something\\nthat you wanted to avoid. You could override that stretch reflex by way of a decision made\\nwith your upper motor neurons, your insula, and your cognition, and almost certainly\\nthose von Economo neurons, which would be screaming, \"Don\\'t do this, don\\'t do this, don\\'t do this,\" could shuttle that\\ninformation to brain areas that would allow you\\nto override the reflex and essentially push through the pain. And maybe even, in fact, even not experience the pain to the same degree or even at all. So, these von Economo neurons sit at a very important\\njunction within the brain. They pay attention to what\\'s\\ngoing on in your body, pain, pleasure, et cetera. And that includes what\\'s\\ngoing on with your limbs and your limb range of motion', metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". And that includes what's\\ngoing on with your limbs and your limb range of motion. They also are paying attention and can control the amount of activation, kind of alertness or calmness that you are able to\\ncreate within your body in response to a given sensory experience. And as I mentioned before, they seem to be uniquely\\nenriched in humans, they seem to be related to\\nthe aspects of our evolution that allow us to make decisions about what to do with our body in ways that other\\nanimals just simply can't. Before we go any further, I want to give you a practical tool that you can, of course, use, but that will also give\\nyou insight and experience into your muscle spindle\\nspinal cord circuit mechanisms. So, what I'd like you to do is if you're in a proper place to do this, you're going to stand with legs straight, meaning knees not bent, and you're going to try\\nand touch your toes, or for some of you that's\\ngoing to be very easy and you might even be\\nable to put your hands flat on the floor. I don't have that kind of flexibility, it's pretty easy for me to touch my toes. I don't care if you\\nround your back or not, although ideally I would\\nsay don't round your back. Not because it's bad to do so necessarily, but just to try and keep this the same from trial to trial, as it were. So, try and get a sense of\\nwhat your range of motion is in terms of bending over at the waist while maintaining a flat back and trying to touch your\\ntoes or even touch the floor. Maybe, again, you can even\\ngo hands flat to the floor or maybe even far out in front of you. Okay, now what I'd like\\nyou to do is stand back up and I'd like you to\\ncontract your quadriceps as hard as you possibly\\ncan for about 5-15 seconds. Let's say 10 seconds just to keep things\\nmore or less normalized. This obviously is not a\\nsuper controlled experiment. So, to contract your quadriceps for those of you who don't know, you're going to extend\\nyour lower limb out\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". So, this would be like kicking, although don't do it too quickly, you're going to kick out your foot, you should feel your quadriceps contract on the top of your thighs. And you're going to try and\\nconsciously contract them as hard as you can. Okay, typically if you\\nwant to point your toe back towards your knee or\\nshin that's also going to help somewhat to contract\\neven harder and harder. Okay, so, do that for about 10 seconds. A lot of you will do\\nthis just while standing, contract, contract, contract. Okay, then release it, and then now go ahead\\nand repeat that stretch where you're trying to touch\\nyour toes or touch the floor. So, this is, again, relying more or less on hamstring flexibility\\namong other things. Okay, what most of you will find is that you have an immediate increase in hamstring flexibility, or your range of motion has increased. If you didn't experience that, then I would encourage you to try and contract your\\nquadriceps harder and longer, so maybe 20 or 30 seconds, and then try this\\nso-called experiment again. Why would contracting your quadriceps allow your hamstring flexibility\\nto suddenly increase? Well, the way that our\\nmuscles are organized is such that we have muscles that are antagonistic to one another. So, our quadriceps and our hamstrings work in sort of a push-pull\\nfashion, if you will. They can antagonize one another, so when you move your\\nheel towards your glutes, you are using your hamstring, the hamstring obviously\\nalso does other things related to hip movement. And when you lift your knee or when you extend your foot and contract your quadriceps, you are essentially\\nrelaxing the hamstrings. Now, of course, most movements involve both quadricep and\\nhamstring in synchrony. And that synchrony is\\nreally an elegant one, but here we're more or less isolating the quadriceps from the hamstrings, at least to the extent\\nthat it can leverage these spindle stretch mechanisms\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". So, what happens is when you\\ncontract your quadriceps hard, you are relaxing or\\nreleasing some of the stretch that's occurring in those\\nintrafusal spindle sensory fibers going into your spinal cord. And as a consequence, you're able then to stretch\\nyour hamstrings further, or we can be more accurate and\\nsay that your range of motion about the hamstring and its related joints is greater when you aren't\\nengaging that spindle reflex, which would cause the\\nhamstrings to contract. Okay, so if you are somebody\\nwho has tight hamstrings, there could be a variety\\nof reasons for that, but part of the reason\\nis likely to be neural and you can release that\\nneural spindle reflex by contracting the opposite\\nantagonistic muscle, which in this case is the quadriceps. The same thing is true\\nand can be leveraged for stretching other muscles. So, for instance, if you're\\ngoing to do a tricep stretch, the typical kind of overhead\\nwhere you grab your elbow and move it toward the\\nmidline of your body with using your opposite hand. Well, you can do that, and then I would suggest\\ntrying to flex your bicep, contract your bicep that\\nis, while doing that. And for most people\\nyou'll notice a increase in the tricep range of motion or ability to kind of lean into, or to relax into, or to push that stretch, excuse me, a little bit further. Now, for you physios out there and for those of you that have\\nbackgrounds in kinesiology, I want to acknowledge, of course, there are other mechanisms that are coming into play. There are actually neural connections within the joints themselves that are providing\\nproprioceptive feedback, et cetera, et cetera. But this is simply to illustrate that part of our range of motion is determined by these spindle mechanisms that I spent some time\\nfocusing on earlier. And indeed, this approach can be leveraged toward creating increased\\nlimb range of motion, not just for the hamstrings,\\nbut for your quadriceps\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". So, for instance, if you\\nhave tight quadriceps, you can do the opposite. You can contract your\\nhamstring very intensely for let's say 10 seconds, or\\n20 seconds, or 30 seconds. So, that would take some conscious effort of bringing your heel\\nup towards your glutes. You could do that in a way that you're really trying to\\ncontract those muscles hard, you'd have to use some deliberate hamstring activation there, meaning you have to use\\nthose upper motor neurons and the other aspects of your\\nupper brain power, as it were, to try and really contract your hamstrings as intensely as possible,\\nthen you would relax that, and then you would do your\\nquadricep stretch again. And if you did a pre-hamstring contraction measurement of your quadricep flexibility, and then you did a\\npost-hamstring contraction measure of your quadricep flexibility, almost certainly you would find that that flexibility had increased. Now, of course, the muscle\\nreally didn't change much, the tendons didn't change much. What changed was the\\npatterns of neural activation that were restricting you\\nfrom in the first case stretching your hamstring or having a... To be more accurate we should say having a certain range of\\nmotion about the hamstring and its related joints and those brake mechanisms were removed. And, of course, then when\\nyou contract your hamstring, you're removing some of the neural brakes, the spindle acting as a brake and inhibiting that\\nquadricep range of motion. Okay, so you can imagine this, and in fact you can apply this for any number of different muscles, the larger muscles and the sort of biceps, triceps, and hamstrings, quadriceps that are sort of the simplest\\nplace to think about this and to apply it. But in theory and, indeed, in practice, it really works for all\\nthe various muscle groups, it's just sometimes harder to access these so-called\\nantagonistic muscle groups\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". Now, we should take a\\nmoment and just discuss what actually happens\\nas we get more flexible in the short-term and long-term. I just mentioned what\\nhappens in the short-term, clearly those don't involve\\nlengthening of the muscles. It's not like the muscles\\nslide along the bones or that the tendons really stretch out that much more than they had\\nprior to that kind of exercise. But it is the case that if people stretch consistently over a given\\nperiod of several weeks or more that there are changes in the muscles. This gets a little bit tricky\\nin terms of nomenclature, and I just want to highlight that because I think that a number of people get frustrated and confused, in fact, when we talk about\\nmuscles getting longer. You know, that the whole concept\\nof a muscle getting longer isn't really in keeping with reality, but there are elements within the muscles that can change their confirmation. So, to get a little bit detailed here, and we won't spend too much time on this, but I just want to acknowledge this for those of you that are interested in neuromuscular physiology and how it relates to flexibility. You know, you have your muscle fibers and then you have your\\nso-called myofibrils. So, you can imagine\\nkind of a single fiber, that fiber, of course, will get input from those motor neurons. And then within those fibers, you have what are called sarcomeres. And you can kind of think about sarcomeres as little segments, kind of\\nlike the segments of bamboo. If you ever look at bamboo,\\nit's not just one big stalk, it's got those little\\noutpouching along the way that going to break up the what would be just\\none big stalk of bamboo into different segments,\\nbut they're all connected. The sarcomeres are somewhat like that. And within the sarcomeres you have a couple of different components. One thing is called myosin,\\nwhich is like a thick layer, and then the other is actin\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". One thing is called myosin,\\nwhich is like a thick layer, and then the other is actin. And those are interdigitated, as we say, they're kind of connected to one another, kind of like if you were\\nput your fingers together from your two hands. If you put your fingers in between one another,\\nthat's interdigitated, literally interdigitated in\\nthis case, so pun intended. And that myosin and actin kind of move relative to one another and they have a lot to\\ndo with your ability to contract muscles. When we stretch muscles, when we go through a stretching practice, there are a number of things that change, some neural, some related\\ndirectly to connective tissue, but also it appears from really nice work mainly done from McGill University, I'll provide a link to a\\ncouple of these studies if you want to dig in there more deeply, that change the confirmation, the relative size and spacing\\nof some of these things like sarcomeres and the\\nway that myosin and actin kind of work together. But we don't want to think\\nof muscles as lengthening, we can, however, think about\\nthe resting state of a muscle being slightly different\\nor, indeed, very different than the resting state of a muscle of somebody or of a limb that has not undergone\\nregular flexibility training. So, that's as much time\\nas I want to spend on that because we could spend an entire hour getting right down into the details, but I do want to emphasize, however, that muscles have different\\nparts, they have fibers, they have sarcomeres, they\\nhave myosin, they have actin. But the idea of making our muscles longer, that reflects a number of processes that occur basically within\\nan existing muscle length\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". The length of our muscle bellies and where our insertions are relative to our connective tissue in our limbs is genetically determined, right? Some people have, for instance, a bicep that goes all the way\\nfrom the crook of their elbow up to their shoulder, right? And some people can if\\nthey were to put their arm in a 90 degree angle could\\nput two or three fingers between their bicep and their elbow. They have, we can say, a shorter\\nbicep, relatively shorter. Now, the reason I mentioned these highly detailed cellular mechanisms is because as we start to\\nembark on different protocols for using stretching\\nto increase flexibility and range of motion, we need to ask ourselves what\\nis preventing our ability to extend range of motion? Is it the spindle, right? Is it because the muscle\\nis stretching too much? Oftentimes, it can be because of that and/or because of a sense of pain or simply a sense that the\\nmuscle is not in a position that it's been in before that's unrelated to pain\\nor to spindle activation. And oftentimes, it can be related directly to these changes in the\\nconfirmation of myosin and actin, and within the context of the sarcomeres. Now, of course, you can't peer into or sense your individual sarcomeres, however, you do have neurons\\nthat innovate these areas and that send that sensory information back into the spinal cord and\\nup to your brain to interpret. So, you'll find that as we move along, there are specific\\nadjustments that you can make at both the macro level, meaning how much movement to insert into your stretching, right? Is it going to be a static, or a dynamic, or even a ballistic stretch? Or, for instance, at the micro level, that even just a slight sub-millimeter or millimeter increase in the\\nstretching of a given muscle and it related tissues can translate into an increased\\nrange of motion performance. As a quick but relevant aside, I thought I'd share with\\nyou something useful that's also grounded in this\\nnotion of antagonistic muscles\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". So, for those of you that\\ndo resistance training, whether or not it's with body weight, or with physical weights,\\nor machines, what have you, you may have found that if you, let's say, were to do three\\nsets of a pushing exercise, so this could be pushups, this could be bench presses,\\nthis could be shoulder presses, something of that sort. And then, later in the\\nworkout you were to do, let's say, machine\\npull-downs, or pull-ups, or chin-ups of some sort,\\nso a pulling exercise. Typically, what you would find is if you were to do what's\\noften called straight sets, so you would do three sets of pushups, let's say, with two\\nminutes of rest in between that you might be able to get a certain number of\\nrepetitions on the first set. Let's just for sake of example, let's say you can get 10\\nrepetitions on the first set, and then you get eight\\nrepetitions on the second set, and then you get six\\nrepetitions on the third set with two minutes in between, and then you would move on at some point to your pulling exercises. And similarly, let's say\\nyou were doing chin-ups or pull-downs and you\\nwould get 10 repetitions, rest two minutes, eight repetitions, rest two\\nminutes, and six repetitions. Okay, fine. Well, typically what people discover is that if they interleave their pushing and pulling exercises, provided they do that for muscles that are antagonistic to one another. So, in this case, pushing with the chest, shoulders, and triceps\\nfor the pushing exercises, and pulling with the back and biceps, and, of course, there are\\nother muscles involved as well. But because those muscle groups are at least in part\\nantagonistic to one another, what people often find\\nis that if they were to, say, do their pushing\\nset, get 10 repetitions, then move to a pulling set after just say 60 seconds\\nand perform that pulling set, then go back to the pushing set, then go back to a pulling set, push, pull, push, pull, in other words, interleaving their sets\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". Even if they were to maintain\\nthe same amount of rest between sets of pushing\\nand sets of pulling, what they discover often is that the drop in the number of repetitions that they get is somewhat offset. So, rather than get 10, 8, 6, as it were with the straight sets, it will be 10, 9, 8. So, what this means is\\nnot that you're increasing the total rest time to\\nfour minutes between sets because then, of course,\\nit wouldn't be equivalent, but rather that while maintaining\\nthe same amount of rest between sets for this same muscle group, by going from push, pull, push, pull of antagonistic muscles, you're able to have improved performance. And the reason for that\\nhas everything to do with what we were describing before, which is that typically if\\nyou were to do push set, rest, push set, rest, push set, rest. Well, in between those sets and, in fact, actually\\nduring those sets of pushing, the pulling muscles that would\\nbe involved in the chin-ups or pull-downs, et cetera,\\nare actually relaxing, or at least are being\\nreleased of some tension, including the activation of the\\nspindles among other things. So, that's a long-winded way of saying that interleaving push and\\npull of antagonistic sets can leverage some of\\nthe same neural circuits that we're talking about leveraging for sake of increasing flexibility. Now, I offer this to you\\nas a tool that you can try. One of the challenges\\nwith using this tool, however, is that you often\\nhave to occupy multiple sites within the gym. You know, if you're doing this at home and you have your own\\ngym, that's one thing. If you're doing this in a gym where you have multiple\\npieces of equipment, well, then you become that person who has essentially taken\\nover some small corner, or multiple corners, or\\nmachines within the gym. And oftentimes, you'll\\nfind that you'll walk back to a machine or you'll walk back to a given resistance exercise and someone has now taken it over and the whole thing could be thrown off\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". So, it takes a little bit of orchestrating in order to do properly. But in general, what people find is that this can allow you to\\nenhance performance overall of these individual movements, again, while maintaining\\nthe same amount of rest. And even if you choose not to do this, I encourage you to pay\\nattention to this as a concept because, again, it's leveraging this idea of antagonistic muscles,\\nflexors and extensors, antagonistic neural relationships between the spinal cord mechanisms that control one set of muscles and activating those muscles, allowing the opposite\\nantagonistic muscle to relax and therefore to perform\\nbetter on its next set. So, now I'd like to shift to the question of what types of stretching\\ncan and should we do to increase limb range of motion? If our goal is to do that in the most efficient way possible 'cause I realize that most people don't have endless amounts of time to dedicate to a stretching practice. And even for those of us that do, I'm sure that you want\\nto get the most outcome for a given effort. And what are the modes of stretching that are going to allow us\\nto increase our flexibility and limb range of motion most safely? Now, there are a number of\\ndifferent types of stretching or methods of stretching. Broadly defined, we can\\ndescribe these as dynamic, ballistic, static, and\\nwhat's called PNF stretching. PNF stands for Proprioceptive\\nNeuromuscular Facilitation, and it involves and leverages\\nmany of the mechanisms that I described to you earlier. The first two that I mentioned, dynamic and ballistic stretching, both involves some degree of momentum, and can be distinguished from static and PNF-type stretching. Now, to distinguish dynamic stretching from ballistic stretching, I'd like to focus on\\nthis element of momentum. Both involve moving a limb\\nthrough a given range of motion, in dynamic stretching, however, it tends to be more controlled,\\nless use of momentum, especially towards the\\nend range of motion\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". Whereas in ballistic stretching, there tends to be a bit\\nmore swinging of the limb or use of momentum. So, I invite you to visualize what dynamic and ballistic stretching\\nmight look like in your mind, you can even try it if it's\\nsafe for you to try it. You know, you could imagine\\nswinging your arm up overhead as much as possible and bringing it down. I'm doing this because I'm seated, it's kind of a ridiculous\\nmovement to do while seated or perhaps at all. But for instance, you can see dynamic and\\nballistic stretching. Anytime someone, for instance,\\nis holding onto something with one arm or maybe not holding on and swinging out their foot, so essentially getting\\nmovement about the hip joint. And you'll notice that\\nsome people raise it up, and pause it, and bring it down, that's one form of dynamic stretching. Whereas others will swing it up and sort of let it carry\\nitself a bit further due to the momentum at\\nthe top of the movement, and then just let it drop back down or maybe even control the descent. There is an enormous range\\nof parameter space here or variables that one could imagine, and there's just simply no way that we could subdivide all those. But again, dynamic and\\nballistic stretching both involve movement, so we have to generate some force in order to create that movement. Ballistic stretching\\ninvolving a bit more momentum or sometimes a lot more momentum, especially at the end range of of motion. Now, both of those are highly distinct from static stretching, which involves holding\\nthe end range of motion, so minimizing the amount\\nof momentum that's used. So, to stay with the simple example that we are all now familiar with from our earlier discussion, slowly bending over at the waist and trying to touch your toes or putting your hands to the floor and then holding that end position before coming up in a\\nslow and controlled way, such that you reduce the\\namount of momentum to near zero would be one example of static stretching\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". Static stretching can\\nbe further subdivided into active or passive. Right, there are different names for these kinds of approaches. You can hear about the Anderson approach or the Jander approach, you can look these sorts\\nof things up online. And, again, people tend to\\nname things after themselves, so some of these are proprietary related to specific programs,\\nI'm not focusing on those. Others come to be named\\nafter the physiologists or the practitioners that\\ninitially popularize them. As is always the case, there's always a naming and renaming and claiming of territory\\nwith these things. For the time being, I'd\\nlike to just emphasize that static stretching can be both active, where there's a dedicated effort on the part of the stretcher, you, to put force behind the\\nhold to kind of extend or literally to extend\\nthe range of motion. And then, there's also\\npassive static stretching in which it's more of a relaxation into a further range of motion, and that can be a subtle distinction. And there are other ways in\\nwhich we can further distinguish active and passive static stretching. But nonetheless, static stretching involves both those types of\\nelements, active and passive, but is really about eliminating momentum. And then, there's the PNF, the Proprioceptive\\nNeuromuscular Facilitation. And proprioception has\\nseveral different meanings in the context of\\nneuroscience and physiology. To just keep it really simple for today, proprioception involves both\\na knowledge and understanding of where our limbs are in\\nspace and relative to our body. Typically, relative to the midline, so the brain is often trying to figure out where are our limbs\\nrelative to our midline down the center of our body. And we know where our limbs are based on so-called\\nproprioceptive feedback, so that's feedback that\\ncomes from sensory neurons\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". Right, now you know what sensory neurons that are essentially monitoring or responding to events within the joints, the connective tissue, and the muscles, and within the deep\\ncomponents of the muscles like the spindle reflex, and within the tendons like the GTO, the Golgi tendon organ. So, PNF-type stretching leverages these sorts of\\nmechanisms, these neural circuits, by way of, for instance,\\nyou would lie on your back and if your goal is to increase\\nyour hamstring flexibility and the flexibility and range of motion of other related muscle systems, you might put a strap around your ankle and pull that muscle. Or I should say, excuse\\nme, that limb towards you, you're not going to pull\\nthe muscle towards you, you're going to pull that\\nlimb your ankle towards you to try and get it sort\\nof back over your head. And then, progressively\\nrelaxing into that, or maybe even putting\\nsome additional force to push the end range of\\nmotion and then relaxing it. And then, actually trying\\nto stretch that same limb or increase the limb range\\nof motion without the strap. Right, sometimes these are\\nassisted by other people. So, people will even use loads, sometimes they'll even use machines. There are a number of different apparati that have been designed for this, sometimes it'll involve\\na training partner. There's a huge range of PNF protocols, and those protocols can\\nbe done both by oneself with or without straps, with machines, with actual weights, or\\nwith training partners. If you're interested in\\nthe variation of exercises to, say, target your hamstrings\\nversus your quadriceps versus your shoulders versus\\nyour chest muscles, et cetera, your neck muscles, and so on, there is an enormous range of information on dynamic, ballistic,\\nstatic, and PNF stretches for all the various muscle groups. And I should say there\\nare some excellent books on those topics, there are also some excellent videos on YouTube and elsewhere\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". Nowadays, it's pretty\\neasy to find exercises that allow you to target\\nspecific muscle groups. Again, I encourage you to be\\nsafe in how you approach this, and I would encourage\\nyou also to pay attention to the information that soon follows as to what sorts of\\nprotocols one would use to apply those exercises. But the number of exercises and the availability of those exercises for targeting different muscle groups with these four different\\nkinds of stretching is both immense and\\nfortunately, thankfully, immediately accessible to\\nall of us often at zero cost. So, specific exercises to target specific muscle groups aside, we've now established that there are four major\\ncategories of stretching, or at least those are\\nthe four major categories I'm defining today. And we can further divide those categories into which are the ones that\\nare going to be most effective for increasing range of\\nmotion in the long-term, not just in one individual session. And there have been a number\\nof studies exploring this. I can list out at least four, and we'll put those four\\nas a kind of a cluster under one heading in\\nthe show note captions that arrive at essentially\\nthe same answer, which is that for increasing\\nlimb range of motion, it does appear that static type, including PNF, but static-type stretching is going to be more effective than dynamic and ballistic stretching. So, at least in my\\nmind, this is good news. Why is it good news to me? Well, while dynamic and\\nballistic stretching can be immensely useful\\nfor improving performance of specific movements, in particular, in the\\ncontext of particular sports like tennis, or in sprinting,\\nor frankly for any sport, they do carry with them\\na certain amount of risk because of the use of momentum. So, you don't need to be highly trained in order to perform them. In fact, there is a place and we will describe when one\\nwould want to apply dynamic or ballistic stretching\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". I'll just give away for now, I think that most physios out there and certainly the ones that I spoke to, Dr. Andy Galpin, Dr. Kelly\\nStarrett, and a few others point to the fact that doing some safe dynamic and ballistic stretching prior to, say, a resistance\\ntraining session, or maybe even prior to a\\ncardiovascular training session can be useful both in terms\\nof range of motion effects and in terms of neural activation effects. I don't want to use the words warm-up because warming up is typically associated with increasing core body\\ntemperature, as it should be, but for engaging the neural circuits and becoming familiarized\\nwith the neural circuits that you're about to\\nuse in other movements while also increasing the\\nrange of motion of the joints involved in those movements so that you can perform them more safely and more confidently. So, I'm certainly not saying, I want to repeat, I'm certainly not saying that dynamic and ballistic\\nstretching are not useful, they absolutely are, but in terms of increasing\\nlimb range of motion in the long-term of truly\\nbecoming more flexible as opposed to transiently more flexible, static stretching, which includes PNF, appears to be the best route to go. So, if your goal is to increase\\nyour limb range of motion for a given muscle group, or\\nperhaps for all muscle groups, although you can imagine\\nthat'd be pretty tough. I mean, you're not going to spend time, I could imagine, working on\\nyour tongue muscle control or neck muscle control\\nand every muscle control, but most of us want to\\nreduce so-called tightness in air quotes and increase\\nlimb range of motion for certain muscle groups. And it appears that\\nthe best way to do that is going to be static\\nstretching of some kind, which raises the question of how often to do that static stretching and how long to hold\\nthose static stretches\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='. And we can also ask the question, we should ask the question, where to hold those static stretches? Is it always a good idea to\\nhold those static stretches at the end or the point of\\nmaximal range of motion? We\\'re going to address that now. There\\'s some terrific science around this. A slightly older study, but nonetheless a powerful one because it provided a foundation for a lot of subsequent work, which basically served to just confirm the answer they got here is\\na study from Bandy et al. And the title of this study is The Effect of Time and\\nFrequency of Static Stretching on the Flexibility of\\nthe Hamstring Muscles. It was a study involving 93 subjects, so 61 men, 32 women ranging\\nan age from 21-39 years, so a pretty broad demographic who had limited hamstring\\nmuscle flexibility, here I\\'m paraphrasing, and randomly assigned\\nto one of five groups. So, the four stretching groups stretched five days\\nper week for six weeks, the fifth group, which served\\nas a control, did not stretch. The results clearly show that quote, \"The change in flexibility\\nappeared to be dependent on the duration and\\nfrequency of stretching.\" This is great, this tells us that stretching\\nfor a given amount of time scales with the amount\\nof limb range of motion improvement that one will see. There were many interesting\\nfindings within this study, but the one that I\\'d like\\nto highlight most is quote, \"The results of this study\\nsuggest that a 30 second duration is an effective amount of time to sustain a hamstring muscle stretch in order to increase range of motion. No increase in flexibility occurred when the duration of\\nstretching was increased from 30 seconds to 60 seconds, or when the frequency of\\nstretching was increased from one to three times per day.\" Okay, so now we\\'re starting\\nto lay down some parameters. What this study reveals and\\nwhat subsequent studies tell us, and we will get into\\nthose subsequent studies, is that ideally one\\nwould do static stretches that are held for 30 seconds', metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". Perhaps more in certain instances, and I'll explain when that can be useful, but here holding those stretches\\nfor more than 30 seconds did not turn out to be\\nadditionally useful. So, if you're going to stretch\\nyour quadricep, for instance, and you're going to hold that\\nstretch in static fashion, remember not using momentum, and you can use the mental tricks of either trying to push through the pain, which I don't recommend necessarily, I think that makes us prone to injury, or to relax into the stretch, but nonetheless providing some force typically with a hand in\\norder to pull your ankle back, if you're doing a quadricep stretch, some people might do this\\non the edge of a sofa. Remember, there are a lot\\nof different exercises and ways to do this that\\nyou can explore elsewhere. Well, holding that static\\nstretch for 30 seconds appears to be sufficient to stimulate an increase in\\nlimb range of motion over time. Again, these are protocols that were used repeatedly over time, and we'll talk about\\nhow often to repeat them in order to get maximal effect. But 30-second holds for static stretches is the number that I\\nthink we want to focus on and that most of us are\\ngoing to want to utilize. So, now let's explore how\\nmany sets of static stretching one ought to do in order to get a maximum range of motion improvement while not placing us into a system that's going to create injury nor a situation where we have\\nto be constantly stretching throughout the day because, again, most of us\\ndon't have time to do that. This issue of sets is an important one. In the context of cardiovascular exercise, we've talked about the\\ndata that support the fact that doing at least 150 and ideally as much as\\n200 minutes per week of Zone 2 cardiovascular exercise is very useful for cardiovascular health and for other aspects of health\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". And, of course, there are other aspects of cardiovascular exercise that could be layered onto and into that that can be useful like 90 second maximal sprints, et cetera. Discussed this a lot in the\\nepisode with Dr. Andy Galpin and on our episode about endurance. And we also talked about sets in the context of strength\\nand hypertrophy building, building muscle size and/or strength in the episode about that. And in particular, in the\\nepisode with Dr. Andy Galpin, and there, we could also arrive\\nat some specific parameters. And it's going to vary, of\\ncourse, between individuals, depending on how hard you train, whether or not you take sets to failure, your repetition range, et cetera, but in the context of strength\\nand hypertrophy building, we arrived at a approximately six, maybe as many as 10 sets\\nper week per muscle group. Some of that work is done as direct work to a given muscle group, some\\nof that work is indirect. So, doing certain pulling exercise, of course, will target the\\nlatissimus dorsi muscles, but also the biceps. So, that doesn't necessarily\\nmean you have to do 10 sets for the biceps and for the lats, sometimes you're getting some\\nindirect work, et cetera. All of that was delineated in the episode with Dr. Andy Galpin. And we arrived at those numbers of sets according to the same criteria\\nthat we will apply here, what is the minimum number of sets both to maintain and to improve a given mode of performance? Strength and hypertrophy\\nor cardiovascular health, again, to either maintain or improve. And we can do the same thing for improving or maintaining range of motion because as I mentioned earlier, the data pointed to the fact that if we don't do some dedicated work to improve range of motion over time, we will lose our flexibility and limb range of motion over time just by virtue of the fact that we're not doing\\nanything to offset that\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='. So, whether or not you want to maintain, reestablish, or gain limb range of motion, static stretching of holds of\\n30 seconds appear to be best. Now, the question is how\\nlong should you do that? And how many sets should you do that? And how many times a\\nweek should you do that? And to answer those questions, I\\'m going to turn to what I think is a really spectacular review. This was a review that was\\npublished in the year 2018, so it\\'s fairly recent, first author Thomas, Ewan Thomas, last author Palma. We will put a link to this\\nin the show note caption. The title of the paper is The Relation Between\\nStretching Typology and Stretching Duration: The\\nEffects on Range of Motion. It\\'s a very straightforward title. This is a review article that explored a number of different studies, had criteria for whether\\nor not those studies could be evaluated in the\\ncontext of the questions here, had some quality standards\\nand some other standards that they applied. And basically, windowed down\\na large collection of studies to a remaining 23 articles that were able to be\\nconsidered quote, \"Eligible and included in the quantitative\\nsynthesis done here.\" So, key points from that quantification and synthesis done in this paper. First of all, and I quote,\\n\"All stretching typologies showed range of motion improvements\\nover a long-term period. However, the static protocols\\nshowed significant gains with a p-value less than .05,\" which means a probability\\nthat cannot be explained by chance alone, \"When compared to ballistic\\nor PNF protocols.\" So, again, that we\\'re hearing\\nis that static stretching is the preferred mode for\\nincreasing limb range of motion. Although, here they make\\nthe additional point that static stretching\\nmight even be superior, not just to ballistic stretching,\\nbut also to PNF protocols. Because before, as you may recall, there was a distinction\\nbetween ballistic and dynamic, and static and PNF', metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='. And so, here it appears\\nagain that static stretching is sort of rising to the top of the list as the optimal approach relative to all other\\nstretching approaches, at least in the context of\\nincreasing limb range of motion. The authors go on to say,\\n\"Time spent stretching per week seems fundamental to elicit\\nrange of movement improvements when stretches are applied\\nfor at least or more than five minutes per week.\" Okay, this is critical. This is not five minutes per stretch. Remember, 30 seconds per static stretch, but at least five minutes per week. Whereas the time spent stretching\\nwithin a single session does not seem to have a significant effect for range of motion gains. If this is getting confusing, I\\'ll make sure that you soon understand exactly what we can export\\nfrom these conclusions. The data indicated that\\nperforming stretching at least five days a week. Now, some of you may already be groaning, for at least five minutes per week. Okay, so five days per week, that\\'s a lot, but at least five minutes per week, five minutes per week is not that much. \"Using static stretching may be beneficial to promote range of motion improvements.\" Okay, I\\'ve read this study in detail now, they highlight, again, the\\nreduction in flexibility that occurs from 20-49\\nyears of age and so on, how acute bouts of short-term stretching up to three weeks can\\nimprove stretch tolerance. I think that\\'s a key point\\nthat in the short-term, the first three weeks of embarking on a stretching and flexibility program, much of the improvements\\ncome from the short-term neural improvements that\\nwe talked about before of inhibiting the\\nspindle reflex and so on. And also, a stretch tolerance, a comfort with doing the movements and maybe even a comfort in overriding some of the pain mechanisms.

       " Document(page_content=\". I'll talk a little bit more\\nabout that in just a bit and the particular utility of yoga. Something that I don't often practice, but that after reading this article that I'll mention in a little bit, I'm considering perhaps taking up some form of yoga protocol. Now, I've already highlighted some of the key take aways from the study, namely that we need to get at\\nleast five minutes per week of static stretching per muscle group. And based on the previous\\npaper that we talked about, we need to divide that five minutes into sets of 30 seconds each. And as I mentioned earlier, it doesn't seem to be the case that you can do all of that\\nin one day, unfortunately. It does seem important that the frequency of stretching practice distributed throughout\\nthe week is important. So, let's talk protocols. We are now talking about\\ndoing static stretching, so holding, so limiting momentum and holding a stretch\\nfor 30 seconds per set. We're talking about trying to achieve five minutes per week\\nof those static holds, but that we can't do it all in one session because the frequency of sessions distributed throughout the week correlates with the improvements\\nin limb range of motion. So, what this means is that\\nwe should probably be doing anywhere from two to four sets of 30 second static holds stretches five days per week or\\nsome variant thereof. And I do say some variant\\nthereof because it turns out that even though there\\nwas that earlier study that we talked about that holding a stretch\\nfor more than 30 seconds, in that case 60 seconds, didn't turn out to be\\nadditionally beneficial. It appears that if you\\ndo hold those stretches for 60 seconds per static\\nstretching set, for instance, you can get away with stretching fewer days per week overall\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='. So, in order to make\\nthis as clear as possible \\'cause I do realize there\\nare a lot of parameters and you might be asking, \"Why didn\\'t you just make me a list of the exact things I should do?\" Well, it doesn\\'t work that way because once you understand the mechanisms and once you understand\\nyour particular goals, this information is designed\\nfor you to be able to construct a stretching program that is tailored to your specific goals. If I just gave you the stretching\\nprogram that I\\'m doing, or I should say that I\\'m soon to be doing \\'cause I\\'m soon to be doing one based on the research for\\nthis particular episode. Well, that wouldn\\'t be beneficial for you because, for instance, if you\\nhave very flexible hamstrings, but not very flexible quadriceps, or you are somebody\\nwho is engaged in sport or not engaged in sport, what you need to do is\\ngoing to vary somewhat. So, what would effective\\nstretching protocol look like? We\\'re all trying to improve\\nlimb range of motion for different limbs and\\ndifferent muscle groups. But just by way of example, and it\\'s because the one we\\'ve been using, let\\'s talk about hamstrings\\nfor the time being. This could, of course, be\\napplied to other muscle groups. Let\\'s say you want to\\nimprove hamstring flexibility and limb range of motion\\nabout and around the hamstring and involving the hamstring, you would want to do three sets of static stretching for the hamstring. Again, easy to find such\\nexercises on the internet. You would do that by holding\\nthe stretch for 30 seconds, resting some period of time, and doing it again,\\nholding for 30 seconds, resting some period of time, and then holding it for 30 seconds. That would be one training\\nsession for the hamstrings. I have to imagine that you\\'d\\nprobably want to stretch other muscle groups as\\nwell in that same session', metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". Although, at least as far as I could tell, there was no data pointing to the fact that you couldn't do\\nyour hamstring stretching one part of the day and your quadricep stretching\\nanother part of the day. But presumably, you're\\ngoing to want to combine your flexibility training\\ninto one single session. So, three sets of 30 seconds each get 90 seconds, and you would do that\\nideally five times a week or maybe even more because it does seem like frequency distributed throughout the\\nweek is an important parameter. Now, one thing that we\\nhave not highlighted or at least described is how long to rest\\nbetween stretching sets. And despite my efforts, I could not find\\nresearch-backed information that pointed to whether\\nor not 30 seconds of rest for every 30 seconds stretching, or 60 seconds rest for every\\n30 second stretching was ideal. I think it's reasonable to assume that doubling the amount of time for the interleaving rest would be appropriate or at least doable. If anyone out there has\\nknowledge about rest between stretching sets\\nand has some physiology, or some biology, or some\\nexperiential information as to why a given ratio of\\nduration of static stretch to rest in between static\\nstretch sets ought to be used, please put it in the comments on YouTube, that'd be a terrific way for\\nus to get that information. I'd love to do any follow-up to links that you provide and so on. But now, we're starting\\nto build into a protocol that is backed by the scientific data. Three sets of 30 seconds of holds done five times or maybe\\neven six times per week. One thing that did show\\nup in my exploration of the peer-reviewed research is this notion of warming up for all this. We haven't talked about that yet. In general, to avoid injury, it's a good idea to raise your\\ncore body temperature a bit before doing these kinds of stretches. Even these static stretches, which we can sort of ease into and don't involve ballistic\\nmovement by definition\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='. And the basic take away\\nthat I was able to find was that if we are\\nalready warm from running, or from weight training,\\nor from some other activity that doing the static stretching practice at the end of\\nthat weight training, or cardiovascular, or\\nother physical session would allow us to go immediately\\ninto the stretching session because we\\'re already warm, so to speak. Otherwise, raising one\\'s core\\nbody temperature by a bit by doing five to seven,\\nmaybe even 10 minutes of easy cardiovascular exercise\\nor calisthenic movements, provided you can do those\\nwithout getting injured, seems to be an ideal way to\\nwarm up the body for stretching. We should be warm or warm-up to stretch, although those warm-ups don\\'t have to be extremely extensive. And then, just by way of logic, doing the static stretching\\nafter resistance training or cardiovascular training\\nseems to be most beneficial. In fact, and unfortunately\\nwe don\\'t have time to go into this in too much detail today, I was able to find a number of\\npapers that make the argument that static stretching prior\\nto cardiovascular training and maybe even prior\\nto resistance training can limit our performance in running and resistance training. I realize that\\'s a controversial area, you have those who say, \"No,\\nit\\'s immensely beneficial,\" you have those who say, \"No,\\nit inhibits performance,\" and those that say, \"No, it\\'s a matter of how exactly you perform\\nthat static stretching, and which muscle groups,\\nand how you\\'re doing this, and how much time in between static stretching and performance.\" But to leave all that aside, doing static stretching after\\nsome other form of exercise and if not after some form of exercise, after a brief warm-up to raise\\nyour core body temperature definitely seems like the right way to go. Now, for some of you out there, and I confess for me as well, doing something five days a week seems like a big commitment, even if that commitment is\\none to only do three sets of 30 second static stretches', metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". I say this because you've got the warm-up, I generally like to\\nbring a kind of a focus and dedication to a practice. And, of course, because when\\ndoing these kinds of protocols, it's likely that you're not\\njust stretching your hamstring, so it's not just 90 seconds of work with a minute of rest in between, but very likely that we're also\\ndoing quadricep stretching, and also doing stretching\\nfor the shoulders, and stretching for the back,\\nand the neck, and so on. And so, that entire session\\nis going to take some time, and five days a week is a\\npretty serious commitment for most, especially for those\\nof us that don't exercise or do athletics for a\\nliving, which I don't. So, there is some evidence\\nfrom the literature that one can get away with, or I don't even know that\\nwe should think about it as getting away with, but that one can do longer\\nhold static stretches of up to say 60 seconds, but do fewer total sessions per week. So, rather than three\\n30 second static holds, doing three 60 second static holds and doing those every other day. And there really hasn't been a systematic exploration of this. The article that I was referring\\nto just a few moments ago, this analysis of the 23 articles was combined into this\\nenormous set of tables and some really quite nice graphs that you're welcome to look at since we're going to\\nprovide a link to the study. There are a couple of key take\\naways that I want to mention that are separate from this issue of how long to stretch and how often. First of all, they describe\\nin their discussion that there were improvements\\nin range of motion independent of whether or not\\npeople did static stretching, active stretching, passive stretching, ballistic stretching, or PNF stretching. So, all of those forms of stretching will improve limb range of motion. This is essential to point out and I want to emphasize this. Static stretching, however, gave the greatest degree of\\ngains in limb range of motion. And on average, they saw a 20\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". And on average, they saw a 20.9% increase, but some of the other\\nincreases they observed were also quite substantial. So, ballistic stretching can also provide some pretty impressive limb\\nrange of motion improvements. However, they tended to be in the range of, here they point out, 11.65% increase, or in the case of PNF, a 15% increase. So, it appears that the\\ngreatest improvements in limb range of motion for\\nyour time spent and effort spent is going to be this minimum\\nof five minutes per week to elicit a significant response with five days being the minimum weekly recommended frequency to achieve significant range\\nof motion improvements. I confess, this was\\npretty surprising to me when I compare flexibility training to, say, resistance training\\nfor strength and hypertrophy. I've had the experience, and I know that other people\\nhave had the experience, and I think Dr. Andy\\nGalpin would probably agree that provided one trains\\nhard enough and appropriately that you don't need to\\ntrain resistance training five days a week in order to\\nget significant improvements in strength and hypertrophy. Some people might need to, but you can get a lot of positive results in those variables with\\nless frequent training, certainly with three or four\\ndays a week of training. And for cardiovascular training, I'm not aware of anyone having tested whether or not one very long run each week can actually increase\\ncardiovascular fitness and you're not doing anything else. Although, I have to\\nimagine you'd probably see some improvement compared\\nto not doing anything, but most people are doing\\nrepeated training sessions of cardiovascular strength training. Not a lot of people are\\ndoing five days a week of strength training, at\\nleast that I'm aware of. Some people are, but most\\npeople I think are not. And some people are\\ndoing five or more days a week of cardiovascular training\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". And some people are\\ndoing five or more days a week of cardiovascular training. I'm guessing that most people\\nare not doing five days a week of dedicated static stretch range of motion directed training, but it does appear that that\\nfrequency about the week getting those repeated sessions, even if they are short for\\nan individual muscle group, turns out to be important. And so, that points to perhaps the reason why so few people are doing\\ndedicated range of motion work, but it also reminds me\\nthat all of the studies that were described at\\nleast in this review and some of the other ones that were not really show impressive changes\\nin limb range of motion. I mean, 20+%, or even 15% with PNF, I mean, these are big changes\\nthat are going to benefit us, they're going to offset\\nthe age-related losses in flexibility, for sure, if one is dedicated about these practices. And in many cases, they're going to increase\\nlimb range of motion in ways that are going to\\nallow us better performance in certain physical endeavors,\\ncertainly better balance. All right, we haven't really talked about balance and stability, but range of motion can\\nimpair balance and stability in some extreme circumstances, but by and large, limb range\\nof motion, lack of tightness, improved posture, improved\\nphysical performance, excuse me. And things of that sort is something that I think we can all benefit from, and that are key features of longevity. We don't often think of them because we so prioritize\\ncardiovascular health and the relationship between\\nthe heart and brain health, and resistance training, and\\nmusculoskeletal hypertrophy, or strength, et cetera\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". But as I delved into this literature, it really highlighted for me the extent to which having really\\ngood limb range of motion, at least maintaining limb range of motion as we age from year to year, and maybe even improving\\nlimb range of motion can be immensely beneficial\\nfor reducing pain for, again, improving posture, improving our ability to\\nperform, to walk, et cetera. And indeed, there's a whole literature that relates our limb range of motion to things like pain management of things related to headache\\nand so on and so forth. So, limb range of motion is not just about becoming a contortionist or being able to complete the yoga class, it really is about maintaining\\nthe integrity and the health of the neuromuscular system,\\nthe connective tissue, and the neuromuscular connective network because those are indeed\\nworking as an ecosystem and a network. I'd like to just briefly touch on PNF stretching for a moment. Again, this is a vast landscape with many parameters and\\ndifferent practitioners, a lot of competing opinions out there, to put it lightly. Nonetheless, I do want to\\nemphasize that the PNF training leverages those spindle mechanisms and GTO mechanisms that\\nwe talked about earlier, but I realize that in describing\\nthe quadricep contraction, hamstring stretch little mini-experiment that hopefully you did, that I didn't really highlight\\nthe role of the GTOs, the Golgi tendon organs that much. And I just would like to just\\nbriefly do that for a moment. The GTOs have multiple functions. In fact, I think even though GTOs are in every medical textbook,\\nevery physiology textbook, every first year neuroscientist\\nlearns about them when learning about the\\nneuromuscular junctions and the mechanisms of\\ninteroception, et cetera, they're likely to have\\nother functions as well\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". And one of the reasons why\\nPNF stretching does work, whether or not you're\\ndoing that by using a strap to pull back a limb, or whether or not you're\\nactively contracting your quadriceps to then\\nrelease and emphasize stretch range of motion\\nfor your hamstrings and related muscle groups is\\nthat activation of those GTOs, meaning putting loads and\\ntension into that system can inhibit the spindles in the opposite\\nantagonistic muscle groups. Okay, so one of the reasons why flexing, or I should say\\ncontracting your quadriceps really intensely for some period of time allows your hamstrings to\\nsubsequently experience greater range of motion. And again, it's not just the hamstrings, but the related connective tissue and neural circuits, et cetera is because yes, it's\\nquote-unquote relaxing the hamstrings and the spindle, but there's also a direct relationship between activation of\\nthe GTOs in the quadricep and release of the spindles in the hamstring and related muscles. This has a name, it's\\ncalled autogenic inhibition, it's a fancy name for\\ncontraction of one muscle group providing a relaxation\\nof the other muscle group that's antagonistic to it. And it relates back to this idea of interleaving sets in the gym. So, if you think back to that example, now it should make sense\\nas to why, for instance, if you do, let's say,\\na set of bench presses or shoulder presses, and you let's say you get 10 repetitions and you fail on the 11th, that muscle is very, very fatigued\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='. If you were to rest some period of time and then go back and do another set, well, during the rest, that\\nmuscle group has been relaxing, it\\'s obviously not\\ncontracting the same way it was during the resistance set, but by going and doing a pulling exercise that involves the\\nantagonistic muscle group, so strongly contracting the\\nback muscles through a pull like a pull-down, or a chin-up,\\nor a row-type exercise, you\\'re activating or near\\nactivating the GTO system in those pulling muscles in a way that provides autogenic inhibition\\nfor the pushing muscles. Now, again, the physios out there are probably either screaming or banging their heads\\nagainst whatever sound system this happens to be arriving\\nthrough to them saying, \"Wait, but in many cases, the GTOs\\naren\\'t activated enough to provide that autogenic inhibition.\" That\\'s true, but even the\\nsub-threshold activation of those intraspinal circuits, so the place where the GTO circuit and the spindle circuit interact, can provide an additional replenishment of, say, the pushing muscles while you\\'re activating\\nthose pulling muscles. And this is at least one, not the only, but at least one mechanism by which interleaving push\\nand pull, push and pull for both strength and\\nhypertrophy training, but also for range of motion\\nstretching-type training can allow you to achieve better results in a shorter period of time. And I raise this because\\nI want to keep in mind the efficiency of any training program. We just a moment ago\\nestablished that doing, for example, three sets\\nof 30 second static holds can be very useful for the hamstrings with let\\'s just say for sake\\nof simplicity and practicality a minute\\'s rest in between.

So, there are a number of different ways in which you can start to\\ninterleave static stretching with PNF stretching, you can start to interleave\\neven PNF-type protocols with resistance training, although that gets a bit more complicated. You can really start to construct and build protocols\\nthat are ideal for you. What we will do is for an upcoming Neural\\nNetwork Newsletter. So, for those of you that aren't familiar, the Huberman Lab Podcast has a so-called Neural Network Newsletter, these are monthly newsletters\\nwhere we put distilled points from the podcast and oftentimes protocols in a downloadable PDF form. You can access it by giving us your email, we don't share your email with anybody. If you want to see examples of these, you can go to hubermanlab.com and go to the menu and see Newsletter, you don't have to sign up for anything to see examples of what these are like. I'll provide a couple\\nof different protocols, one that is pure static stretching, one that involves PNF-type stretching, and I'll also put down a protocol that involves the antagonistic\\ninterleaved muscle training of the sort that I've been describing a few times throughout this episode. And then, you can try and apply those either separately or maybe\\ncombine them in some way that's useful for your goals. There are a couple of key\\nelements that are essential for building a safe and\\neffective range of motion increasing program that arrived to us both through the peer-reviewed research and, admittedly, from people\\nthat have been involved in teaching and training range of motion for a very long period of time. Some of you may be familiar with the so-called Anderson method, it's been around for a long time. Actually have never met Anderson, I don't, I should know this, I don't even know if he's still alive, I hope he's still alive, but in any event, there are\\na lot of different features to the Anderson and other protocols\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='. But one of the aspects\\nof the Anderson protocol that I think is highly relevant. In fact, I know is relevant\\nto the peer-reviewed research that we\\'re going to talk\\nabout in a few moments is this notion of pushing through pain, and how active or how passive\\nto be about static stretching. Now, this is somewhat subjective. Right, if you think about\\ngetting into a stretch, again, we\\'ll just use the\\nhamstrings for example. So, you\\'re either reaching\\nfor your toes while seated, or maybe you\\'re using a strap and you\\'re raising your foot\\noverhead while lying down, or maybe you\\'re doing a\\ntoe touch-type exercise. How far should you reach? Where is the end range of motion? Should you balance?\\nShould you not balance? We\\'re going to talk a little\\nbit more about that in a moment, but Anderson has an\\ninteresting idea and principle, which has thread through\\na lot of his teachings that I think are very much\\nin keeping with the study that I\\'m about to describe next, where he emphasizes to yes, to stretch to the end\\nof the range of motion, but not to focus so much on\\nwhere that range of motion happens to be that day. So, for instance, not thinking, \"Oh, I can always touch my toes, for instance. And therefore that\\'s the starting place for my flexibility training today.\" But rather to take the entirety\\nof your system into account each day and understand that, okay, provided your warmed up appropriately, that you\\'re now going to\\nstretch your hamstrings, for instance, and you\\'re going\\nto reach down for your toes, but that your range of motion\\nmight be adjusted that day by way of tension and stress, or by way of ambient\\ntemperature in the room. And to basically define\\nthe end range of motion as the place where you\\ncan feel the stretch in the relevant muscle groups', metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". I think this is important because unlike resistance training or cardiovascular training, where we can measure\\ndistance traveled over time in the case of cardiovascular training, or how much weight is on the bar, and count repetitions, et cetera. With range of motion training, of course, range of motion is the feature that we're interested in, but there is likely to be a lot\\nof variation from day-to-day based on a number of different internal and external factors. And so, the Anderson method is really about getting into static and other forms of stretching. I think today we've mainly been focusing on static stretching and\\nholding the end range of motion, but really paying attention\\nto the feel of the stretch and the muscles involved. And there are parallels in resistance and cardiovascular training\\ntoo I realize, right? In the case of trying\\nto build hypertrophy, or I should say improve\\nhypertrophy, muscle size, oftentimes the best\\nadvice that one can give is to don't try to lift weights, but rather to challenge muscles. Now, of course, you need\\nto provide adequate loads in order to get hypertrophy, but when you're training\\npurely for strength, it's about moving weights. When you're training\\npurely for hypertrophy or mainly for hypertrophy, it's really about challenging\\nmuscles using weights or other forms of resistance. And similarly, and in keeping\\nwith this Anderson method, when trying to build limb range of motion, doing static stretching at a\\nplace where it's difficult, but that you can experience\\nthe stretch of the muscle cognitively, consciously being\\nable to focus on the muscles and their stretch is at least as useful as is evaluating the\\ncurrent range of motion you're able to achieve. So, what does this mean? This means feel the muscles\\nas you stretch them, don't just go through the motions. And this means don't get so attached to being able to always achieve, for instance, a stretch\\nof a given distance within a given session\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". You might actually find that\\nby just finding the place where you can't get much further and holding the static stretch there, that on the second and third set that you happen to be doing that day, that your range of motion will\\nbe increased considerably. Maybe not, but very likely yes, you will. And, of course, evaluating\\nrange of motion over time is the key parameter because that's the goal\\nof all this type of work. Now, along these lines, there is this variable that\\nwe've mentioned a few times of passive versus active stretching, and there's this even\\nmore nebulous variable, this even more kind of subjective thing of how much effort to put into it? Should you push into the stretch? Would you even want to balance a tiny bit? Would you want to reach\\ninto that end point and try and extend it within\\na given set and session? And for that reason, I was excited to find this paper entitled A Comparison of\\nTwo Stretching Modalities on Lower-Limb Range of Motion Measurements in Recreational Dancers. Happens to be done in\\nrecreational dancers, it's a six-week intervention program that compared low-intensity stretching, which they call Microstretching. They used a capital M, so I don't know if that\\nmeans that it's proprietary, although I didn't see evidence\\nof a conflict of interest, but they call it Microstretching. But to be very clear, Microstretching in the\\ncase of this manuscript is low-intensity stretching. And they compared that with moderate intensity static stretching on an active and passive ranges of motion. Okay, so there are a lot of\\ndifferent variables are here, but I'll just highlight\\na few of the things that are really most relevant to us, and I'll give you the\\ntake away at the outset and then return to it at the end so that if I lose any of your attention in the next couple of minutes, at least you have that key take away\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='. Basically, what they found was that a six-week training program using very low-intensity stretching had a greater positive effect\\non lower limb range of motion than did moderate-intensity\\nstatic stretching. I find that incredibly\\ninteresting, so very low intensity, and we\\'ll define what\\nthat means in a moment. Here, I\\'m quoting them, \"The most interesting aspect of the study was the greater increase\\nin active range of motion compared to passive range of motion by the Microstretching group.\" So, this relates to what\\nwe were just talking about a few moments ago as it\\nrelates to the Anderson method, which is that very\\nlow-intensity stretching, meaning effort that feels not painful and in fact might even feel\\neasy or at least not straining to exceed a given range of motion turns out to not just be as effective, but more effective than\\nmoderate-intensity stretching. So, what is low-intensity\\nstatic stretching? Well, they define this as\\nthe stretches were completed at an intensity of 30-40% where 100% equals the\\npoint of pain, right? So, 30-40% in these individuals, and again, I\\'m paraphrasing, induced a relaxed state\\nwithin the individual and the specific muscle. And here they were holding\\nthese static stretches I should mention for one\\nminute, not 30 seconds. Now, the control group was doing the exact same overall protocol, so daily stretching for six weeks, the same exercises, holding\\neach set for 60 seconds, but were using an\\nintensity of stretch of 80% where, again, 100\\nrepresents the point of pain or the point where the person\\nwould want to stop stretching. I find these data incredibly interesting for, I think, what ought\\nto be obvious reasons. If you\\'re going to embark on a flexibility and stretching training program, you don\\'t need to push\\nto the point of pain. In fact, it seems that\\neven just approaching the point of pain is\\ngoing to be less effective than operating at this 30-40% of intensity prior to reaching that pain threshold. The pain threshold being 100%', metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". The pain threshold being 100%. Now, of course, this is pretty subjective, but I think all of us should be able to register within ourselves, so whether a given range of motion or extending a given range of motion brings us to that threshold\\nof pain or near pain. And according to this study at least, operating or performing stretching at an intensity that's quite\\nlow, that's very relaxing turns out to be more beneficial in increasing range of motion than is doing exercises aimed\\nat increasing range of motion at a higher intensity. Okay, so lower intensity stretching, I should say lower\\nintensity static stretching appears to be the most beneficial way to approach stretching. And I think that's a relief\\nprobably to many of us because it also suggests\\nthat the injury risk is going to be lower\\nthan if one were pushing into the pain zone, so to speak. The authors offer a number\\nof different explanations as to why this approach, this\\nMicrostretching approach, might be more effective. Here, I'm paraphrasing\\nfrom their discussion where they mentioned that\\nit could be hypothesized that they had improved\\nreciprocal inhibition within the hamstring muscle group. So, this gets right back to\\nthe sorts of neural mechanisms that we talked about before, that somehow by doing this\\nlow-intensity stretching that they were able to\\naccess some of those spindle and GTO-type mechanisms that\\nwe were referring to earlier, and the inhibition of hamstring\\nand quadricep stretches. They also offer a number\\nof different ideas about how this could shift the activation of the so-called sympathetic, remember the kind of stress\\ndivision of our nervous system, and to reduce that relative to activation of the parasympathetic arm of the nervous system. I confess, they have a couple of arguments around sympathetic, parasympathetic that are somewhat convoluted\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". I will just in fairness\\nto the neuroscience on those systems, I wouldn't suggest putting too much weight on their arguments about\\nsympathetic and parasympathetic. To my mind, they didn't\\nreally hold much water, but here I'm not trying to be disparaging of the overall work, which I\\nthink is really quite sound, which is that low intensity,\\nso called Microstretching, is going to be the most effective way to increase limb range\\nof movement over time. I want to just briefly return to this idea of whether or not to do\\nballistic or static stretching before some sort of skill training, or weight training, or any kind of sport, or even cardiovascular\\nexercise like running. Again, the data are\\nreally split out there. There are even folks who suggest that doing any kind of\\nstretching prior to running is going to lower running efficiency, it's going to require\\nessentially more work and more oxygen uptake at a given speed for a variety of reasons, and runners and that community\\nargue about this endlessly. There are papers in both\\nsides, in both directions, I'm sure I'll hear about\\nsome of this in the comments. I'm not really going to take a\\nstance on this as a consequence because the data are all over the place. However, I think there's a\\ngeneral logic that we can apply, and here I'm borrowing\\nfrom some conversations and some information put out\\nthere by Dr. Andy Galpin, who I think is, of course, both an expert and thinks about these things in a really sound and\\nflexible way, no pun intended. There are instances, for example, where an individual might want\\nto do some static stretching to increase limb range of motion prior to doing weight training even if it's going to\\ninhibit that person's ability to lift as much weight\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". Why would you want to do that? Well, for instance, if somebody has a\\ntightness or a limitation in their neuromuscular\\nconnective tissue system someplace in their body and system that prevents them from using proper form, that they can overcome by\\ndoing some static stretching. Well, that would be a great idea as Dr. Galpin points out. Or for instance, if proper\\nstability within the movement requires increasing limb\\nrange of motion in some way, well then compromising\\nthe use of greater loads could be greatly offset by\\ndoing some static stretching to improve, say, hamstring flexibility or another muscle group flexibility. So, we can't always think about just what's going to allow us or inhibit us from using\\nthe maximal amount of weight or from running as far as we want to run as fast as we want to run. There are instances where\\npeople are trying to overcome injuries where they're trying to come back from a repetitive surgery or something of that sort,\\ncoming back from a layoff where some additional static stretching prior to cardiovascular,\\nor weight training, or skill training, or sport of some kind is going to be useful\\nbecause it's going to put us in a position of greater safety and confidence and performance overall, even if it's adjusting down our speed or the total amount of loads that we use. So, it's you that needs to consider whether or not for you and\\nwithin a given training session you want to do static training, I should say static stretching\\nrange of motion training prior to or after that training session. And similarly, there are a lot of data pointing to the fact\\nthat doing some dynamic or even ballistic stretching\\nprior to skill training, or cardiovascular, or weight\\ntraining can be beneficial in part to warm-up the\\nrelevant neural circuits, joints, and connective\\ntissue, and muscles, and as well to perhaps\\nimprove range of motion or ability to perform those\\nmovements more accurately, with more stability, and\\ntherefore with more confidence\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",

And while Dr. Andy Galpin would never name any\\nprotocol after himself, he's far too humble to do that, I've named a couple of\\nprotocols after him, particularly the Galpin\\nequation for hydration, because he was willing to\\nstick his neck out there and put down some specific\\nnumbers that people could follow in order to ensure proper\\nhydration during training, you can look up the\\nGalpin equation elsewhere. You can just Google it or\\nlook elsewhere and find it. And Dr. Galpin has also been\\nvery thoughtful and generous, and I think very accurate in offering a kind of a general organizational logic for how to think about the goals of a particular training session, and thereby to decide whether or not you're going to do ballistic,\\nor static stretching, and so on and so forth. So, we can refer to this\\ngeneral approach as Galpinian. Galpinian, is that right? Galpin-ian logic, Galpinian logic. Thus far, we've been\\ntalking about stretching for sake of increasing limb\\nflexibility and range of motion, but there are other reasons perhaps to embark on a stretching protocol that include both our ability to relax and access deep relaxation quickly, as well as even to reduce inflammation and perhaps even combat\\ncertain forms of cancer. And if that sounds really far-fetched, I want to emphasize that the study I'm about to share with you in a moment was actually carried out\\nby one of the directors of a division of the National\\nInstitutes of Health. And this was the work of Helene Langevin, who's a medical doctor, has\\ndone really important work on the mechanisms underlying\\nthings like acupuncture and has approached all that from a very mechanistic viewpoint. Right, so not looking just at\\nthe effects of acupuncture, but really trying to understand\\nwhat sorts of cytokines, inflammatory molecules,\\nand pathways are activated? What sorts of neural\\nmechanisms get engaged by things like acupuncture that impinges on the fascial\\ntissues and so forth?

       " Document(page_content='. Langevin is currently Director of the National Institutes of Complementary Health and Medicine at the National Institutes of Health. So, this is a major division\\nsupported by tax dollars that support systematic\\nmechanistic exploration of things like respiration,\\nmeditation, yoga, acupuncture. So, this is serious science\\napplied to protocols and approaches that have been\\nused for some period of time, but really aimed at trying to understand what would the best protocols\\nbe to evolve new protocols? So, there\\'s a really interesting study done in animal models, but I think it\\'s a powerful enough result that I think we all should\\npay attention to it. The title of this paper, and, again, the last author\\nis Dr. Langevin herself, is Stretching Reduces Tumor Growth in a Mouse Breast Cancer Model. And yes, you can get mice to stretch, it turns out that if you gently\\nlift up mice by their tail and they\\'ll hold onto their cage, there\\'s a way in which you\\ncan mechanically stretch them in a way that doesn\\'t harm them. First, I should mention\\nthat Dr. Langevin and others have shown that just a brief\\nwhole body stretch of that sort induces an increase in activation\\nof the parasympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system, again, not arm, limb arm, but the aspect of the\\nautonomic nervous system that creates a whole body, whole nervous system shift\\ntoward more relaxation. So, yes, indeed stretching induces relaxation at a systemic level, not just at a local level. And I think that\\'s important, probably not surprising to those of you that use stretching regularly, but yes, it does indeed relax us. Yes, you can do this in mice\\nand see that in mice as well. Here\\'s what they did\\nfor this current study, or I should say this was\\na study published in 2018 in Scientific Reports. They write, \"Recent studies have shown that gentle daily stretching\\nfor 10 minutes can reduce local connective tissue\\ninflammation and fibrosis', metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='.\" Now, that\\'s local tissue\\ninflammation and fibrosis as well we now know as\\nsystemic inflammation and can induce relaxation systemically. In this case, they focused\\non mice, not humans. And mice were randomized to a stretch versus no stretch condition and were treated for 10 minutes\\nonce a day for four weeks. So, it\\'s 10 minutes of this\\npassive whole body stretching a day for four weeks. What\\'s remarkable, I mean, just I have to say is just striking is that tumor volume in these mice, they were able to induce\\ntumors in these mice and the tumor volume at the\\nend point was 52% smaller in the stretch group compared\\nto the no stretch group. This is a highly significant effect, and they point out in the\\nabsence of any other treatment. And they explored whether or\\nnot cytotoxic immune responses were activated and a\\nnumber of other features. They weren\\'t able to get too deeply into the underlying mechanisms, but this is pretty remarkable. Even three weeks into stretching protocol, this daily stretching\\nprotocol for these mice tumor volume was reduced, I\\nmean, by it\\'s almost halved, this is pretty incredible. So, they have these\\nmeasures of tumor volume and the only difference\\nin the way these animals were treated and handled was the introduction\\nof this daily stretch. I find this result to\\nbe, of course, limited in to the extent that it\\'s\\ndone in an animal model, not in humans, we have to point it out, but as they point out in their discussion, \"Our results demonstrate a 52% reduction in mammary tumor growth over one month in mice undergoing stretching\\nfor 10 minutes a day without any other form of therapy', metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='.\" Do they think that stretching itself is changing the tumor size? No, in fact they raise the\\npossibility that stretching because of its impact on the fascia might even create micro environments that are more permissive for tumor growth in certain instances, so they\\'re careful to emphasize what I also believe to be the case, which is that it\\'s unlikely\\nthat the stretching itself was directly acting to reduce tumor size, but rather that there\\'s this possible link between inflammation and\\nimmune exhaustion mechanisms that if you can periodically\\nrelax a nervous system, here through stretching, that it can affect certain pathways related to the immune system that would allow the immune\\nsystem to combat tumor growth to a significant degree. So, again, even though\\nthis is a study in mice, it argues that relaxation\\ninduced by stretching can have a powerful influence\\non mammary tumor growth. Again, a huge effect carried out by one of the premier labs and individuals who do this sort of work and\\nthink about this sort of thing.

Now, as a related and\\nsomewhat final point, I\\'d like to return to\\nthis idea and this place, this real estate within our brain that we call the insular\\ncortex, the insula.

And the fact that we are able to make and perform interpretations of\\nour internal landscape pain, our dedication to a practice, for instance, whether\\nor not we are in pain because it's a practice that\\nwe are doing intentionally and want to improve ourselves, or whether or not it's\\npain that's arriving through some externally\\nimposed demands or situations. Well, the insula is handling all that. And fortunately, there's a wonderful paper that was published, it was a few years ago now in\\nthe journal Cerebral Cortex, which is a fine journal. This is the year 2014 entitled Insular Cortex Mediates\\nIncreased Pain Tolerance in Yoga Practitioners. I'll tell you why I like this study. I'm personally not a practitioner of yoga, I've taken a few yoga\\nclasses over the years, I've done some of the hot yoga classes. Those rooms can get really,\\nreally warm, I confess, and I've done the kind of\\nstandard yoga every now and again. It's not something that\\nI've kept up regularly. This study explored the effects on brain structure volume\\nin yoga practitioners. And for those of you out there\\nthat are aficionados in yoga, they pulled subjects from\\nhaving backgrounds in the... Here, I'm probably going to mispronounce these different things, and forgive me, the Vinysasa yogas, the Ashtanga yogas, the Iyengar yogas, the Sivananda yogas. Okay, so some people were\\nnew to these practices, some were experienced. That the important take aways were that they took\\nthese yoga practitioners and they didn't explore\\ntheir brain structure in the context of yoga itself, they looked at things like pain tolerance. So, they used thermal stimulation, basically they put people into conditions where they gave them very\\nhot or very cold stimuli and compared those yoga practitioners of varying levels of yoga experience to those that had no experience with yoga, so-called controls. And they found some\\nreally interesting things, there are a lot of data in this paper, but here's something\\nI'd like to highlight\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". The pain tolerance of yoga practitioners was double or more to that\\nof non-yoga practitioners, even for those that weren't\\ndoing this so-called hot yoga. Right, they also found that pain tolerance was significantly greater, both for heat pain and for cold pain. They also found significant\\nincreases in insula, again, the insula, this brain region, gray matter volume. Typically, when we talk about gray matter, we're talking about the\\nso-called cell bodies, the location in neurons\\nwhere the genome is housed and where the kind of all the\\nhousekeeping stuff is there. And then white matter volume\\ntends to be the axons, the wires because they're\\nensheathed with this stuff that appears white in MRIs, and indeed is white under the microscope, and indeed is white, it's\\nactually lipid, which is myelin. So, increased gray matter\\nvolume of the insula is a significant finding because what it suggests is\\nthat people that are doing yoga have an increased volume\\nof these areas of the brain that are associated with\\ninteroceptive awareness and for being able to\\nmake judgements about pain and why one is experiencing pain, not just to lean away from pain, but to utilize or leverage\\nor even overcome pain. So, there are many studies of\\nyoga and meditation out there, few that have as much\\nmechanistic detail as this one. And in fact, there's a beautiful figure, Figure 3 in this paper that shows that the gray matter volume of this particular brain region scales in a almost linear way with the duration of yoga practice that somebody has been taking on in years. So, people that had, well,\\nhey had a few subjects that have up to 15 or 16\\nyears of yoga practice had much larger left\\ninsula gray matter volume, bigger brain areas associated\\nwith these abilities. And I find this interesting because there are a lot\\nof activities out there that don't create these kind\\nof changes in brain volume, especially within the insula\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",

So, it appears that it\\'s\\nnot just the performance of the yogic movements, but the overcoming or the kind of pushing into the end ranges of motion and to push through\\ndiscomfort to some extent, of course, we want people doing\\nthat in a healthy, safe way, but that allows yoga practitioners to build up the structure and function of these brain areas that\\nallow them to cope with pain better than other individuals, and to cope with other kinds\\nof interoceptive challenges, if you will, not just pain but cold, not just pain but discomfort of being in a particular\\nposition to do that. And again, we wouldn\\'t want\\npeople placing themselves into a compromised position\\nliterally that would harm them, especially given that earlier we heard that Microstretching of\\nthe kind of non-painful sort low-intensity sort is\\nactually going to be more effective for increasing end range of motion.

And as a final point, there\\'s a beautiful graph in this paper, beautiful I think because it explores some of the more subjective\\ndimensions of yoga and insula function, which is a here I\\'ll read\\nit out in the nerdy form and then I\\'ll explain what it means, \"This is a frequency histogram of categories of mental\\nstrategies used by yogis versus controls during the\\ncold pain tolerance task.\" What they\\'re describing here and showing is quantitatively how\\npeople are conceptualizing cold pain in order to get through it', metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",

Some people just choose to\\ndistract themselves from pain or to attempt to, other\\npeople will try to ignore it, it\\'s a lot like distraction, but nonetheless, to engage\\nin a negative emotion, sort of like, \"[growls]\\nlike I\\'m going to dig, I\\'m going to be in resistance to this.\" Control subjects tended\\nto use those approaches, whereas practitioners\\nof yoga tended to use other sorts of subjective\\napproaches like positive imagery to some extent, the ability to relax\\ndespite the extreme cold, the ability to quote-unquote accept like, \"This is just happening,\"\\ndespite the extreme cold, to observe, to third person themselves.

So, if ever there was a practice\\nthat one could embark on that would not only increase flexibility and limb range of motion, but would also allow one to cultivate some improved mental functioning as it relates to pain tolerance and other features of stress management that no doubt wick out\\ninto other areas of life, appears that yoga is a\\nquite useful practice. And so, for those of\\nyou that are interested in increasing limb range of motion and you're already a\\npractitioner of yoga, great.

You'll be that dot way out\\non the far end of the graph that shows that your\\ninsula is that much bigger than the rest of ours, and therefore your internal\\nawareness, and pain thresholds, and stress management\\nwill be that much better, but of course, yoga isn't the only way to increase limb range of\\nmotion and flexibility. Up until now, we've described a number of different ways to do that and we've arrived at some\\ngeneral themes and protocols. Again, those themes and\\nprotocols will be distilled into some specific and precise list in our Neural Network Newsletter, but we can revisit a couple of them now just in summary and synthesis. Static stretching appears\\nto be at least among the more useful forms of stretching. So, low or zero momentum stretching typically at end range of motion. I love this concept of Microstretching, even though it's just a couple of studies that have addressed whether\\nor not high-intensity or low-intensity static stretch\\nholds are more beneficial.

And then, there's this idea of frequency, it really does appear that getting at least five minutes per\\nweek total of stretching for a given muscle group\\nis important for creating meaningful, lasting changes\\nin limb range of motion. And that is best achieved\\nby five day a week, or six day a week, or even\\nseven day a week protocols, but those can be very short protocols limited to, say, three sets of 30, maybe in 45 or 60 seconds of static hold. Although, 30 seconds seems\\nto be a key threshold there that can get you maximum benefit. There is no need to do\\nfull 60-second holds unless you're doing fewer\\ntotal sessions per week. And, of course, to always warm-up or to arrive at the\\nstretching session warm. And then, of course, there are\\nthe other forms of stretching that we touched upon a\\nbit, things like PNF. And we talked about why PNF works, things like the spindle and\\nthe Golgi tendon organ reflexes that are built into all of us that we arrive in this world with. And of course, the other\\nforms of stretching that are known to be\\neffective and important, such as dynamic and ballistic stretching. Again, stretching protocols that involve a lot of momentum in order\\nto improve range of motion for performance of\\nparticular types of work that one is about to embark on. Typically, that would be physical work, but a whole interesting\\nand unexplored landscape is the extent to which\\nchanging limb range of motion and different types of body movement actually shape our cognitive abilities, and that will be the\\ntopic of a future episode of this podcast.

Not so much on today's episode, but in many episodes of\\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast we talk about supplements. While supplements aren't\\nnecessary for everybody, many people deriv\\ntremendous benefit from them for things like improving\\nthe transition time and depth of sleep, or for improving focus, or\\nfor a variety of other things including things like anxiety management. For that reason, the Huberman Lab Podcast has decided to partner\\nwith Momentous Supplements. First of all, Momentous Supplements are of the very highest quality, they're used at various\\nprofessional sports teams and they have contracts with various government organizations exploring the role of\\nparticular supplements in human performance. Second of all, they ship internationally because we know a number of you are outside the country\\nof the United States, we hope that will be useful to you. As well, we wanted to\\nhave a single location where people could go to access the most often discussed supplements here on the Huberman Lab Podcast. So, while the full catalog\\nof those supplements isn't quite available yet,\\nmany of them are available, you can find them by going to\\nlivemomentous.com/huberman. Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman to find supplements for sleep,\\nfor recovery from exercise, for focus, and many other features that impact mental health,\\nphysical health, and performance\", metadata={'source': 'tkH2-_jMCSk', 'title': 'Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 3554735, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tkH2-_jMCSk/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-06-13 00:00:00', 'length': 7569, 'author': 'Huberman Lab'}),\n",

At both places, I describe\\nscience and science-related tools that relate to some of the themes covered here on the Huberman Lab Podcast. But oftentimes I'll do posts\\nthat include information and tools not detailed here\\non the Huberman Lab Podcast. We also have a newsletter, I've mentioned this a few\\ntimes during today's episode, it is the Neural Network Newsletter. You can access that newsletter\\ncompletely zero of cost by going to hubermanlab.com, go to the menu and sign\\nup for our newsletter. You supply your email, we do not share your\\nemail with anybody else, we have a very clear privacy\\npolicy that you can find there. If you want to see examples\\nof previous newsletters, you can find them there\\nwithout having to sign up. Again, that Neural Network Newsletter comes out about once a month and we use it to distill\\nout essential protocols from the podcast, to synthesize information\\nfrom the podcast. We do believe many\\npeople find them useful, so sign up for the\\nNeural Network Newsletter if you're interested. So, thank you once again\\nfor joining me today for a discussion about the neural, and neuromuscular, and connective tissue, and skeletal aspects of\\nflexibility and stretching. And as always, thank you for\\nyour interest in science.

      "turns out there are multiple kinds of stretching. So, you can imagine you have stretches where you hold the stretch for a very long time and use as little momentum as possible, and then there's also what's called dynamic and ballistic stretching where you're literally swinging your limbs trying to increase the range of motion. I will explain the science and application of flexibility and stretching in the context of sports performance, whether or not you are engaging in cardiovascular exercise, or resistance exercise, or both, whether or not you're a competitive athlete or simply a recreational exerciser, as I am, whether or not you are trying to increase your range of motion and flexibility for longevity purposes, or whether or not you're trying to do it in order to access different parts of your nervous system 'cause we'll soon learn today that your ability to improve flexibility and, indeed, to engage in specific stretching exercises can actually be used to powerfully modulate your ability to tolerate pain, both emotional and physical pain. So, this thing that we call flexibility and stretching is actually a vast landscape. We're going to simplify and organize all that for you today and by the end of today's episode, you're going to have a number of simple, easy-to-apply tools that are grounded in the best scientific research that you can apply for your specific goals. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero-cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Thesis. Thesis makes custom nootropics that are designed to get your brain and body into the optimal state for the cognitive and physical things that you need to perform at the highest level. I have to confess, in fact I've said it many\n"
